    <p>The recipe for “varied and transmuted wine” on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/43v/f/43v/tl"><u>43v</u></a>
        describes a means to “make wine as claret colored as you like,” then
        change its color to white. What is the purpose of this “varied and
        transmuted” wine, that “can be drunk without danger”?</p>
    <p>Wine is a frequent ingredient in Ms. Fr. 640 entries, and is used in
        varnishes, in pigments, as a binder in sand molds, in making vinegar,
        ubiquitously in medicinal cures, “for fortifying a harried horse” (fol.
        <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/71r/f/71r/tl"><u>71r</u></a>),
        as an alternative to soapy water or urine for cleaning panel paintings
        (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/60v/f/60v/tl"><u>60v</u></a>),
        and for many other uses. Besides “varied and transmuted wine,” there is
        one other recipe for producing an imitation of wine: “A drink having a
        taste of wine,” on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/47v/f/47v/tl"><u>47v</u></a>,
        which specifies to “Take tartar from large vessels &amp; soak it in
        water &amp; it will have the taste of wine.” On fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/33v/f/33v/tl"><u>33v</u></a>,
        a practical joke “For making blood or wine issue from someone’s forehead
        or from a wall,” recommends using “wine or liquid rosette of Brazilwood
        or black cherry juice” to imitate blood.</p>

    <p>The recipe on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/43v/f/43v/tl"><u>43v</u></a>
        calls for brazilwood (<em>bresil</em>), clear water, and a drop of lemon
        or orange juice:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Varied and transmuted wine</p>
        <p>Grate brazilwood very finely, put it to soak one or two hours in
            clear water, then take this tinted water &amp; add to it some clear
            water &amp; you will make <em>
                <del>e</del>
            </em> wine as claret colored as you like. If you please, put a drop
            of lemon or orange juice in it &amp; it will immediately turn white.
            It can be drunk without danger.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The brazilwood available in the Making and Knowing Lab had been donated
        to the project by the conservation lab of the Metropolitan Museum in New
        York (which had received it from B. Barette in January 2000). This
        brazilwood was already in a very finely grated state, and we did not
        grind it further (<i><u>Fig. 1</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 2</u></i>).<a

    <p>We divided the dark orange liquid into three beakers, filled to 55 ml
        each (<i><u>Fig. 6</u></i>). We tested one with orange juice, one with
        lemon juice, and the last one we diluted with water. We added the lemon
        and orange juice drop by drop, until we noticed a change in color in
        each beaker. The total amount of citrus juice added to these beakers did
        not exceed 2 ml. The sample tested with lemon juice rapidly turned a
        light-yellow color, while the sample tested with orange juice turned a
        clearer and lighter shade of orange (<i><u>Fig. 7</u></i>). We then
        added tap water to the last beaker and noticed a very slight change in
        color once we had added about 15 ml of water, the orange tint had gotten
        lighter (<i><u>Fig. 8</u></i>). We then proceeded to add more lemon and
        orange juice to each beaker respectively until no further color changes
        were visible, and both appeared to be similar hues of yellow (<i><u>Fig.
                9</u></i>). It was only upon the addition of 350 ml of tap water
        that the colored water changed to a red-pink tint (<i><u>Fig.
                10</u></i>). We gradually added the water in units of 10 ml
        until no further changes in color could be discerned. The color
        stabilized at 550 ml.</p>

    <h2 id="can-be-drunk-without-danger"> “Can be drunk without danger”</h2>
    <p>Although we did not taste the “wine” we produced, we realized that the
        author-practitioner’s statement that his “varied and transmuted” wine
        “can be drunk without danger” might provide a clue to the recipe’s
        purpose. Adulterated wines are a frequent problem in wine making.
        Ágoston Haraszthy’s 1862 <em>Grape culture, wines and winemaking</em>
        devotes 200 pages to the problem of adulterated wines, and includes
        tests for adulteration. <em>Ure’s Dictionary of Arts, Manufactures and
            Mines</em> (1878) includes methods specifically to determine if red
        wines are adulterated or diluted with brazilwood. Both these books
        emphasize that wines adulterated with brazilwood could be drunk without
        danger.<a href="#fn2"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref2"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> Could fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/43v/f/43v/tl"><u>43v</u></a>
        form a test for detecting adulterated wine? Prohibitions against the
        adulteration of wines date to at least the fifteenth century in France
        and Germany,<a href="#fn3"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref3"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> and the adulteration of beer and
        wine became a crime punishable by death in Scotland at about the same
        time.<a href="#fn4"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref4"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> Our cursory search for
        sixteenth-century descriptions of tests for wine adulteration was
        unsuccessful.</p>
    <p>Instead, we performed a simple test: we added different amounts (10, 20,
        and 30 ml) of the same mixture of brazilwood and water we had used for
        our original experiment to 40 ml of red wine in three beakers. While the
        red wine gave off a more fruity aroma upon the addition of the colored
        brazilwood water, we observed no significant color changes upon adding
        the lemon juice (<i><u>Fig. 12</u></i>). More testing is needed to draw
        definitive conclusions from this experiment, however, the addition of
        brazilwood and water to wine is already visible to an observant naked
        eye, and does not require the lemon juice test to be perceived. While
        the addition of brazilwood, logwood, cochineal, and other red pigments
        to red wine appears to have been a problem in the seventeenth through
        nineteenth centuries, we concluded that it was unlikely the
        author-practitioner’s aim was to adulterate, or to detect adulteration
        in, wine; there is nothing in the language of the recipe on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/43v/f/43v/tl"><u>43v</u></a>
        to suggest that the “wine” made from brazilwood was intended to deceive
        or to stand in for the real thing.</p>

    <h2 id="practical-jokes">Practical Jokes</h2>
    <p>Instead, the recipe on fol. 43v is more closely connected to a section in
        Ms. Fr. 640 on sleight of hand tricks that runs from fols. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/33r/f/33r/tl"><u>33r</u></a>–<a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/43v/f/43v/tl"><u>43v</u></a>.
        These tricks and jokes are often accompanied by illustrations, and
        contain interesting directions and meta-commentary on the tricks, for
        example, fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/33r/f/33r/tl"><u>33r</u></a>
        states that “The conjuror ought not to amuse himself by watching what he
        is doing, but look at the spectators and give them plenty of good
        hocus-pocus words so that they look at his face &amp; not at his hands.”
        Similarly, on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/34v/f/34v/tl"><u>34v</u></a>,
        the entry “For melting or transmuting a jewel put inside a box” suggests
        that while executing the trick, and “making the requisite gestures,” the
        performer will chant the nonsense magic formula
        “<em>inhonorificabilitidinita<del>d</del>tudinibus</em>.”</p>
    <p>Why did the author-practitioner include these tricks and jokes in his
        practical text?<a href="#fn5"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref5"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> Most texts that collected jokes
        and jests in the fifteenth to eighteenth centuries (published in English
        under the name of “jestbooks”) did not include instructions for
        conjuring tricks, but rather, songs and letters, wordplay, riddles,
        banter, dinner-table conversations, and pithy sayings. Popular trickster
        tales that recount the exploits of figures such as Scoggin or Robin
        Goodfellow,<a href="#fn6"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref6"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> while not meant to be “recipes”
        in the fashion of Ms. Fr. 640, do provide specific instances of trickery
        or artifice.</p>
    <p>Another possible explanation is suggested by Paula Findlen who sees jokes
        as integral to the investigation of nature in the early modern period,<a
           href="#fn7"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref7"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> meaning that the
        author-practitioner might be seeking to demonstrate his “ability to
        match nature’s complexity with his own artifice”<a href="#fn8"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref8"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> in such tricks.</p>
    <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The recipe “Varied and transmuted wine” is clearly meant to surprise, if
        not to deceive. The Making and Knowing lab was surprised and charmed by
        this simple trick, which, we imagine, was the author-practitioner’s
        precise aim (<i><u>Vid. 1</u></i>). Like so many other entries in Ms.
        Fr. 640, then, its goal was to create an impressive visual effect
        through artifice—an aim of all “art,” and one that is not so distant
        from sleight of hand.</p>
