        <div>
            <p>In this essay, former Making and Knowing Postdoctoral Scholar
                Donna Bilak presents selected aspects of the pedagogy used by
                the Making and Knowing Project in its creation of <em>Secrets of
                    Craft and Nature</em>. She discusses structures and
                principles of the Making and Knowing Project, and highlights two
                central pillars of the Making and Knowing Lab course: skill
                building and student reconstruction of the processes contained
                in Ms. Fr. 640. She underscores the importance of failure in
                pedagogy more generally, and provides examples of extensions of
                Making and Knowing pedagogy to a variety of other settings.</p>

    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction </h2>
    <p>The Making and Knowing Project devoted 2014–21 to the material and
        intellectual exploration of an anonymous, late sixteenth-century French
        manuscript, a compilation of almost 930 entries about artisanal
        technologies known as BnF Ms. Fr. 640.<a href="#fn1"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref1"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> The Project brings together
        people from across the academy and diverse professions, all with
        different skills and backgrounds, to interpret and understand the craft
        technologies recorded in this early modern text. This collaborative
        process creates multiple lines of expertise that help shed light on
        artisanal processes and tacit knowledge that would otherwise be largely
        opaque to a modern reader.</p>
    <p>The Making and Knowing Project is an international enterprise involving
        many people and moving parts, a central tenet of which is
        collaboration.<a href="#fn2"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref2"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> The Project is built upon the
        interplay between four spheres of activity: the transcription,
        translation, and encoding of the manuscript; critical commentary and
        research through historical reconstruction; regular scholarly exchange
        and open peer review; and digital development. Each of these elements
        involved the pursuit of original research in regularly scheduled
        courses, along with training of students (e.g., in paleography,
        laboratory skills, digital techniques). These spheres worked in concert
        from 2014 to 2020 to produce <em>Secrets of Craft and Nature in
            Renaissance France: A Digital Critical Edition and English
            Translation of BnF Ms. Fr. 640</em>, <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org"><u>https://edition640.makingandknowing.org</u></a>
        (first release 2020). The decision to publish the research as a digital
        critical edition is noteworthy because it made the Making and Knowing
        Project into a digital humanities project in addition to its physical
        research and historical reconstruction goals. A critical edition is a
        scholarly tool that offers critical analysis of a text rendered
        accessible in transcribed and/or translated form in which a scholarly
        introduction functions as its critical apparatus. The Project’s
        born-digital Edition had many advantages over a print format, especially
        for research into embodied techniques and knowledge that is better
        visualized than verbalized. The Edition’s inclusion of student-driven
        content, derived from practice-based pedagogy and collaboration, makes
        up the extended in-depth commentary of Ms. Fr. 640’s entries, and brings
        to light many facets of the manuscript’s genesis, and the artisanal
        knowledge it contains. Its digital format activates its content and can
        capture the dynamism of the students’ material exploration of Ms. Fr.
        640, which was integral to their research process, in ways a printed
        publication cannot.</p>
    <p>This essay explains the concept and practices that structured the
        graduate Laboratory Seminar, <em>Craft and Science: Making Objects in
            the Early Modern World</em>. It discusses the Making and Knowing
        Project’s core pedagogical practices of collaboration, the
        apprenticeship model, and skill building exercises. It also makes
        suggestions for the adaptation of the Project’s teaching methods for use
        in different learning environments, and presents reflections on how
        learning happens, intellectually and emotionally, as a consequence of
        material engagement employed as a tool of textual analysis. These
        observations stem from my own experience with the Laboratory Seminar as
        a Making and Knowing Postdoctoral Scholar in the inaugural years of the
        Project from 2014 to 2017. My perspective has also been shaped by the
        recognition of failure as a productive and generative force and as a
        catalyst in the learning process. This constitutes a significant
        personal and professional takeaway from my time on the Project.<a

        Structure and Principles</h2>
    <p>The Making and Knowing Project was designed to create a scholarly
        resource that would shed light on the manuscript Fr. 640 and its
        remarkable artisanal content, with the goal of publishing it as an open
        access born-digital edition hosted by the Columbia University Libraries.
        Much of the Edition’s critical content is based on the historical
        reconstructions of entries (or “recipes”) in Ms. Fr. 640 produced in the
        <em>Craft and Science</em> Laboratory Seminars, which Pamela Smith
        developed as a blended learning environment where the text-based
        analysis of Ms. Fr. 640 meets experiential, materially-engaged research.
        The Lab Seminar was co-instructed by Smith and three postdoctoral
        scholars (each serving three-year terms) and supported by Project staff
        and guest lecturers. Within the overall Making and Knowing Project’s
        design, the Lab Seminar served to generate student research essays
        (i.e., a central piece of the Edition’s critical apparatus) which
        utilize transcriptions and translations of entries produced in the Text
        and French Paleography Workshops.<a href="#fn4"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref4"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> The <em>Craft and Science</em>
        students reflected the Project’s interdisciplinary nature, coming from
        such fields as art history, anthropology, architecture, creative
        writing, English literature, history, medieval and Renaissance studies,
        textile conservation, and chemistry.</p>
    <p>The student essays present the textual and material analysis of specific
        entries in Ms. Fr. 640 through historical reconstructions undertaken in
        the Lab Seminar and made an argument about what their research reveals
        about process, materials, and sixteenth-century culture and society. The
        student essays also investigated early modern conceptions of nature
        exemplified by the artisanal technologies recorded in Ms. Fr. 640 as
        well as current understandings of how science, art, and scholarship
        interrelate. The reconstruction of Ms. Fr. 640’s historical making
        processes involved text, document, and object‐based historical research
        with hands-on work and material engagement.<a href="#fn5"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref5"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> The Making and Knowing Project
        team members have developed a particular approach to “historical
        reconstruction” in the Lab Seminar as a text-focused approach that uses
        hands-on, material engagement as a teaching and research tool.<a
           href="#fn6"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref6"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> While different disciplines use
        reconstruction in a variety of ways, the Project’s method was determined
        by several limiting factors, including the short time span of a course
        semester, students’ general unfamiliarity with the techniques they
        researched, and the necessity of bringing all students up to speed each
        semester with skill building exercises. The Project came to see the
        goals of the students’ reconstruction as “proof of concept,” one
        component of their exposure to “material and technical literacy,” in
        contrast to an expectation of a completely authentic (or, “scientific”)
        reconstruction, or an expectation of a student’s development of
        artisanal expertise. The Project found that reconstruction became a way
        to generate extremely productive historical questions about material
        life and culture of the past, questions they would never have considered
        without the experience and hands-on engagement with materials and
        techniques in the Lab. The student essays also integrate information and
        insights derived from the students’ hands-on laboratory experiences that
        are logged in “field notes,” a style of journaling modeled on
        qualitative and quantitative techniques of recording used in
        anthropology/archaeology and the natural sciences, and archived in an
        online repository.</p>
    <p>Smith structured <em>Craft and Science</em> as a multi-year series of
        courses with annual Lab Seminar themes derived from general groupings of
        seemingly related entries in Ms. Fr. 640 (the themes eventually were
        expanded into the categories found in the List of Entries).<a

    <p>The Making and Knowing Project sources materials for reconstructions from
        a wide variety of vendors, weighing authenticity, appropriateness,
        historical availability, and the time constraints of the semester.
        Materials are procured from chemical supply companies, craft specialty
        stores, conservation and archival shops, and online suppliers—including
        things like jet (i.e., black-colored lignite), beeswax, lye (sodium
        hydroxide or potassium hydroxide), sulfur, woven linen cloth, and
        hundreds of others. Local supplies are also tapped: oyster shells from a
        restaurant in New York City's Grand Central Terminal (<i><u>Fig.
                1</u></i>), cuttlefish bones from pet stores, cochineal insects
        (a natural dyestuff), and Venice turpentine (today primarily marketed as
        a therapeutic substance used by farriers on horse hoofs, but also used
        in painting and instrument-making) from the artists’ supplier Kremer
        Pigments, beef bones from a kosher butcher shop, and brandy from a
        neighborhood liquor store.</p>

    <p>These modern materials are approximations of substances referred to, or
        deduced from, Ms. Fr. 640 entries. Acknowledgement of the uncertainty
        about the stability and/or authenticity of these materials is
        fundamental to experiential learning in <em>Craft and Science</em> where
        the point of reconstructions is material engagement, which often meant
        “good-enough” material fidelity. Moreover, the manuscript’s entries
        themselves are very far from a “recipe,” with many steps of the
        procedure left out or given in ambiguous brevity, and very often
        suffering from a great lack of clarity, even contradiction. All of which
        meant that students’ reconstructions were not a process of following
        instructions, but instead puzzling through interpretation of the text by
        means of material engagement. Students thus had to grapple with a
        difficult text as well as the vast divide between early modern and
        modern materials and technologies. They learned quickly that their
        experimental protocols might not ever yield definitive results (and
        generally could never do so in the space of a single semester). The
        process is thus rife with opportunities for failure, indeed it is pretty
        much unavoidable. Initial encounters with this reality were often
        disorienting to students used to an academic system that privileges
        end-of-term research papers structured around presenting a defensible
        and/or refutable thesis. Dealing with failure, and developing an
        appreciation for its generative aspects, is discussed in greater detail
        below. For now, I will state that recognition of failure as integral to
        the learning process raises productive questions about the level of
        certainty in historical research (and that of other disciplines), and
        encourages students to think about how to acknowledge that uncertainty
        to reach a judicious interpretation, as well as to help them develop
        perspective on the always-unfinished process of scholarship.</p>
    <p>Historical reconstruction in <em>Craft and Science</em> focuses more on
        process than product, although students did have to complete a
        concentrated research essay of publishable quality by the end of a
        single semester. The emphasis on the process of the reconstruction,
        rather than on the production of an authentic object at the end of it,
        brought to light the way in which reconstruction actually formed another
        facet of close reading and interpretation of a text, and made clear how
        essential reconstruction is to interpretation of such a “how-to” text.
        The Project’s emphasis on experimental process, observation, and
        reflection allowed the guiding questions in the classroom to become: How
        can material engagement assist us with the interpretation of ambiguous,
        often tacit knowledge? What new kinds of questions does insight acquired
        through hands-on experimentation enable us to ask of the text?
        Experiential learning of this sort enabled students to make an
        imaginative leap—a leap necessary to all historical inquiry—back into
        the author-practitioner’s material environment, his knowledge, and his
        expectations and aims of the processes he recorded in the manuscript’s
        entries.</p>

        Collaboration, Learning through Apprenticeship, and Skill Building</h2>
    <p>Textual interpretation of Ms. Fr. 640, and by extension its historical
        reconstruction, is complex. It entails an essential tension between the
        assumptions of the modern reader with their own skillset and the
        knowledge possessed by the sixteenth-century author-practitioner.
        Enigmatic statements along the lines of “as you know [how to do]” are
        one example of how tacit knowledge of different kinds pervades the
        manuscript. What may have been obvious to the author-practitioner
        centuries ago confronts us today with a multitude of questions about
        practice and materials. The entries are often not explicit about the
        material or object being produced. This is demonstrated, for example, by
        references throughout Ms. Fr. 640 to “glue,” “clear glue,” and “very
        clear glue” that likely represent different substances with specific
        tensile properties and optical effects as opposed to being mere
        adjectival attributes.<a href="#fn9"

           role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> Nor are things like time,
        temperature, and measurements stated in precise terms, although such
        quantitative ambiguity is in keeping with how recipes were recorded in
        the early modern period,<a href="#fn10"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref10"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> and the qualitative information
        contained in the recipes actually turned out to be equally useful,
        indeed often more useful than quantitative statements.</p>
    <p>The Making and Knowing Project came to see material engagement as a
        viable instrument of interpretation for probing forms of veiled
        information within the textual record about bygone artisanal practices.
        Knowledge that students gain from hands-on experience opens up pathways
        to understanding early modern material and bodily ways of knowing. In
        this, student work is guided by three principal elements: collaboration,
        an apprenticeship model of knowledge exchange, and the use of skill
        building exercises that help to prepare the <em>Craft and Science</em>
        students to undertake Ms. Fr. 640’s recipe reconstructions.</p>
    <p>The student’s ability to establish a connection between practice in Ms.
        Fr. 640 and historical research is fundamental to the Lab Seminar
        experience, and collaboration is a crucial component in facilitating
        this. The publication of student research is an essential pedagogical
        goal of the Making and Knowing Project. Thus, during the creation of the
        Digital Critical Edition, an enormous amount of work went toward
        facilitating the students’ publication-ready essays by the end of each
        semester. Student essays are crafted in stages, integrating input from
        <em>Craft and Science</em> peers and instructors as well as from
        scholars and artisans affiliated with the Project for their particular
        expertise. Feedback thus occurs throughout the reconstruction research
        and writing process, delivered in different forms. In-class essay
        workshops guided by the instructors (Smith and the postdocs) engage the
        students in reading and critiquing one another’s drafts, using Google
        Docs to collaboratively edit and comment on work online. Additionally,
        students work in close consultation with academic and museum-based
        scholars, as well as with “Expert Makers,” in residence for an intensive
        two-week period each semester, who help with an introduction to the
        techniques relevant to the year’s theme (e.g., molding and casting for
        Year 1).<a href="#fn11"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref11"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> Oversight of the student
        research is further provided through annual Working Group Meetings held
        at Columbia at the conclusion of the academic year. These convene the
        scholars and practitioners associated with a given year’s theme to
        review and discuss student essays with the <em>Craft and Science</em>
        students and instructors, suggesting amendments to student work where
        necessary. The robust, ongoing intellectual support that students need
        as they research and write their essays comes from this collective and
        sustained interaction with individuals with different skills and
        backgrounds, as well as from the intensive collaborative editing process
        throughout the semester. Interpreting and understanding the craft
        technologies and experimental processes embedded in Ms. Fr. 640 is a
        community effort.</p>
    <p>These intersecting spheres of collaboration are also evident in what
        Smith terms the “apprenticeship model,”<a href="#fn12"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref12"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> an innovation of the Laboratory
        Seminar. Etymologically, apprenticeship incorporates the sense of the
        French verb <em>apprendre</em> (to learn) and the Latin
        <em>apprehendere</em> (to apprehend). The concept of apprenticeship,
        then, refers to the act of gaining knowledge and/or skill through
        observing and experiencing a process under the tutelage of a skilled
        practitioner. The Making and Knowing Project’s apprenticeship model
        essentially consists of knowledge-sharing among experts (artisans,
        scholars, conservators) and with students. In this process, distinctions
        about those who teach and those who learn become blurred in the
        knowledge exchanges around obscure materials and techniques. In the
        Project’s apprenticeship model, you are always teaching someone else
        while they are teaching you.</p>
    <p>Skill building in the Lab Seminar commences with an exercise termed
        “historical culinary reconstruction” that aims to introduce the student
        to the promises and pitfalls of reconstructing practical knowledge
        contained in historical texts. The exercise is also undertaken in pairs
        or small groups to underscore the power (and challenges) of
        collaboration. This is intended as a fun, low-stakes introduction to the
        methods of the Making and Knowing Project, that begins with the question
        of what it means to teach yourself to do something by reading about it
        in writing. In the historical culinary reconstruction, students select a
        recipe from a variety of early modern culinary recipes (for instance,
        those readily available in Early English Books Online [EEBO] and the
        Wellcome Library) in order to attempt to reconstruct the obscure object
        of these food recipes at home. This exercise aims to have students
        grapple with how to interpret and obtain materials, with designing a
        workflow for obtaining an outcome in an often-obscure object of
        reconstruction, and to consider what are acceptable compromises with
        regard to authenticity in such a reconstruction (e.g., modern ovens).
        Students are required to document all stages of the execution and
        experience of their historical culinary reconstruction in their field
        notes. This introductory skill building assignment concludes with the
        students’ presentation of their historical culinary reconstructions at
        the next class for consumption and reflection (“digest and discuss”)
        about the experience.</p>
    <p>Skill building exercises are also undertaken with an Expert Maker who
        serves a residency with the <em>Craft and Science</em> Lab Seminar each
        term. In this context, skill building serves to guide students
        step-by-step through a historical artisanal process that relates to the
        theme of a given year. Just a few examples of skill building sessions in
        the Lab Seminar with Expert Makers include lifecasting (Moldmaking and
        Metalworking, 2014–⁠15) (<i><u>Fig. 2</u></i>), oil painting
        (Colormaking, 2015–16) (<i><u>Fig. 3</u></i>), taxidermy (Practical
        Knowledge, 2016–17) (<i><u>Fig. 4</u></i>), levigation of azurite
        pigment (Ephemeral Art, 2017) (<i><u>Fig. 5</u></i>), and engraving of
        copper plates (Impressions, 2018) (<i><u>Fig. 6</u></i>). This didactic
        form of skill building also embodies the “apprenticeship model”
        discussed above.</p>

    <p>Just as the Making and Knowing Project examines the early modern workshop
        as a site of knowledge-making about natural materials and processes, the
        Project itself can be viewed as a modern-day workshop of experimentation
        and knowledge generation. <em>Craft and Science</em> students discover
        through iterative practices the importance of experiment and failure as
        vital elements of creativity and knowledge-making. Cross-pollination of
        ideas and knowledge occurs among scholars, artisans, and students
        through the Lab Seminar. The Lab Seminar creates a heterogeneous,
        interactive space where learning and innovation happen, enabling the
        unexpected (and often unexpectedly insightful) to occur.</p>
    <h2 id="failure">Failure</h2>
    <p>My discussion of Making and Knowing pedagogy has thus far laid out the
        <em>Craft and Science</em> Lab Seminar rationale and its organization.
        It is also useful to share the ways in which various kinds of failure
        affect the Project students’ experience of reconstruction as a dynamic
        agent of intellectual growth. Encounters with failure in the Lab Seminar
        have also impacted my own views on research and teaching. Like anyone, I
        have experienced a wide variety of failures, certainly personally
        instructive. Yet I had never given deep or sustained thought to a
        philosophy of failure until I joined the Making and Knowing Project
        team. Failure can open up important learning opportunities in the
        classroom. What follows are some examples of how different encounters
        with failure shaped the <em>Craft and Science</em> Lab Seminar
        experience. This illuminates the importance of first identifying
        students’ interests and their backgrounds and experiences, and making
        room for the role of emotion in learning.</p>
    <p>The textbook definition of failure essentially describes “a lack of
        success”—whether in a person, thing, or event. Failure can also refer to
        the omission of an expected or required action, a deficiency of some
        sort, or malfunction. Use of the word “failure” tends to be loaded with
        negative weight: abasement, disappointment, shame. The experience of
        failure, however, can possess positive value and even foster unexpected
        success. Asking questions, in fact, invites failure to enter into the
        research process. You may not end up where you thought you would when
        you started.</p>
    <p>The ability to recognize, and follow, the unexpected paths that failure
        can generate can open productive avenues of investigation and lead to
        tangible results and new insights. From this perspective, failure
        constitutes a necessary component of learning. Certainly, failure comes
        in many forms.<a href="#fn13"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref13"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> Teaching at Columbia University
        as part of my work with the Making and Knowing Project brought me into
        close contact with students’ anxieties about encountering failure in any
        form, and, at the same time, their aspirations to perfection in
        accomplishing their projects, failure’s alter ego. This
        failure-perfection binary, an either-or construct, is often reinforced
        by institutional practices such as letter grades, which judge students’
        products with finality and encourage students to understand their
        learning objectives in terms of the product of short-term testing or
        knowledge retention, rather than the long process of education. Failure
        has become a dirty word.</p>

    <h3 id="historical-culinary-reconstruction">Historical Culinary
        Reconstruction</h3>
    <p>When the Making and Knowing Project began teaching in Fall 2014, Smith
        had already dedicated enormous effort and energy in setting <em>Craft
            and Science</em> into motion, years in fact,<a href="#fn14"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref14"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> with considerable preparatory
        work done in conceptualizing the Lab Seminar. It was September, it was
        “showtime,” but none of us (instructors and students) really knew what
        to expect. Our first group of <em>Craft and Science</em> students were
        drawn to the course by its hands-on experimental premise. Smith decided
        to start the course by introducing students to the Making and Knowing
        Project with a historical culinary reconstruction, something she called
        a “skill building” exercise (i.e., the pedagogical concept and practice
        detailed above). The historical culinary reconstruction was not a graded
        assignment and was meant to happen in a “no judgement” zone.</p>
    <p>This first skill building exercise had an unnerving effect on our
        students. It created an unavoidable confrontation with the fact that
        there was no possible way to execute this assignment perfectly. Yet
        perfection was not the point. Early modern culinary recipes (indeed any
        kind of early modern recipe) contain too many variables and unknowns for
        definitive results in a modern kitchen in the space of a week. Several
        of our students, likely for the first time in their academic experience,
        presented total failures at our in-class debrief about executing (and if
        possible, eating) this assignment. “Failure” in this context is
        definable as both a physical and a psychological state, set up by the
        students’ need for specificity in executing the reconstruction
        “perfectly.” That is, they had a deep need for quantitative information
        or instruction, which they believed crucial to “do” the assignment
        properly. The students’ feeling of failure in executing this skill
        building exercise also related to the lack of aesthetic appeal and/or
        inedibility of their historical culinary recreation (subjective sensory
        reactions to the creation of an artifact) (<i><u>Fig. 7</u></i>). This
        also generated self-consciousness (subjective valuation around having
        one’s efforts result in something not identifiable as “good” to eat or
        look at). The underlying feeling at this stage was: “If I can’t do this
        right, how am I going to pass this class?” Even students who experienced
        relative success with their culinary recipe reconstruction (in that it
        was recognizable as food in appearance and taste) expressed uncertainty
        about their ability to perform at a high level in the Lab Seminar.</p>

    <p>The students’ reservations tentatively emerged during our in-class
        historical culinary reconstruction debrief, and I fielded several
        nervous enquiries thereafter about how the reconstruction-based essays
        should be written. The recipes in Ms. Fr. 640 are typically unhelpful in
        providing identifiable materials or explicit instructions for
        measurements and temperature. From the students’ perspective, this
        presented obstacles to obtaining the conclusive results they believed
        were necessary to validate their research, and they had just experienced
        significant research barriers in their own home kitchens when trying to
        interpret early modern culinary recipes. Understandably, they were
        feeling anxiety about how to produce their research essays, which was
        met with empathy from Smith and the rest of the team.</p>
    <p>What the historical culinary reconstruction exercise in fact revealed
        were deeply ingrained issues and anxieties around what is “acceptable”
        and expected in graduate-level research. Students exhibited the extent
        to which they had internalized the judgmental nature of letter grading
        and the Failure-Perfection Binary. While messy iterations, loose
        strands, and dead ends (hallmarks of failure) are a normal part of the
        research process, the current conventional model for the research essay
        expects any trace of these “failures” will be expunged in the submission
        of an essay in its final, polished form.<a href="#fn15"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref15"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> Based on their graduate
        experience to date, our students had no point of reference for working
        with failure as a research methodology. On paper, the historical
        culinary reconstruction presented a useful introductory exercise. In
        practice, it created anxiety. This kind of work in <em>Craft and
            Science</em> was daunting for students and instructors alike. Yet we
        had to move forward as a class, and as a team, and go deeper into
        working with materials as an instrument of textual investigation.</p>
    <h3 id="bread-molding">Bread Molding</h3>
    <p>By the time we undertook our next reconstruction exercise—bread molding,
        taken from an entry in Ms. Fr. 640—a couple of weeks later, anxiety was
        high among our students. This time, it was caused by the enigmatic
        nature of the recipe, “For casting in sulfur” (<a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/140v/tl"><u>fol.
                140v</u></a>):</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>To cast neatly in sulfur, arrange the bread pith under the brazier,
            as you know. Mold in it what you want &amp; let dry, &amp; you will
            have very neat work.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>This entry from Ms. Fr. 640 is accompanied
        by a marginal note with an equally unhelpful suggestion:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Try sulfur passed through melted wax, because it no longer inflames
            &amp; no longer makes eyelets.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>As was the next passage that immediately
        follows on the folio, “Molding and shrinking a large figure”:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Mold it with bread pith coming from the oven, or as the aforesaid,
            &amp; in drying out, it will shrink &amp; consequently the medal
            that you will cast in it. You <del>it</del> can, by this means, by
            elongating and widening the imprinted bread pith, vary the figure
            &amp; with one image make many various ones. Bread coming from the
            oven is better. And the one that is reheated twice retracts more.
            You can cast sulfur without leaving the imprint of the bread to dry,
            if you want to mold as big as it is. But if you want to let it
            shrink, make it dry, either more or less.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>This entry posed many challenges: what was
        the goal of the recipe? What was it <em>for</em>? How to reconstruct a
        process for which we could not recognize an aim or object? We set off on
        trying to follow the process, although we had only barely begun to
        visualize what might be the intended product or outcome. Although the
        first mention of the process is entitled “For casting in sulfur,” we had
        to reconstruct an almost wholly unmentioned process which would allow
        the casting of that sulfur.</p>
    <p>Our first reconstruction hurdle was thus making the bread (mentioned only
        by its “pith” in the entry), an alien undertaking to almost the entire
        class. Aside from the open question about how bread may or may not have
        been made during the early modern period, the majority of the group had
        never made bread from scratch using modern methods. The students showed
        great concern about the lack of an identifiable early modern recipe for
        basic bread, and shamefacedly reported their “failures” of dead
        sourdough starter, non-rising loaves, extremely dense textures, and
        other problems. They found themselves making loaf after loaf, learning
        as they went, with several eventually concluding that bread turned out
        to be a forgiving substance that taught the novice bread maker what it
        needed and how to treat it.</p>
    <p>The second hurdle was making a mold from the bread pith, and students
        tried a variety of techniques: scooping out the soft inner part (the
        “pith”) of their loaves and forming it around objects, or pressing their
        models into a hunk of pith, compressed against a hard surface. Some cut
        their loaves in half, impressing their models into the still-warm
        bread—sometimes using the two halves to make two-piece molds. When
        “B-Day” arrived, we all gathered in the lab with the hunks of misshapen
        bread—i.e., our bread molds—that we had baked and eviscerated in our
        home kitchens (<i><u>Fig. 8</u></i>). By then, these were dried out
        little things bearing impressions from objects pressed into the soft
        inner part of the bread while it was still warm from the oven in
        accordance with the recipe.</p>

    <p>The third hurdle was pouring sulfur into these molds. I harbored
        reservations about how hot, liquid sulfur poured into bread “pith” (the
        soft, spongy inside of the bread’s crust) could possibly be a viable
        casting process. My doubt was rooted in experience with various casting
        techniques as part of my Metal Arts training, as my previous profession
        was as a wax model-maker in Toronto’s jewelry industry. I was not
        thinking about failure per se; I just could not imagine this working
        successfully (not to mention, what was “very neat work” anyway?).
        Nevertheless, we melted sulfur obtained from Amazon Prime in our fume
        hood, ahistorically heated in a saucepan on an electric hotplate, and
        poured the hot liquid into the bread molds we jerry-rigged with masking
        tape and wedged into paper cups for stability. The moment of truth
        arrived when it was time to break open our bread molds once we figured
        that the sulfur had cooled.</p>
    <p>It revealed an unexpectedly wonderful result. The sulfur models that
        emerged from the bread mold displayed a high level of detail—not unlike
        modern polymer-based models used by contemporary artists in order to
        produce more permanent, reusable molds of the object. The surprise that
        the students and I felt at seeing what we produced made me realize that
        I had expected the experiment to fail all along. The bread molding
        experiment was actually a success, despite the seemingly unlikely
        combination of bread and sulfur (<i><u>Fig. 9</u></i>). I realized that
        my own lack of faith in the recipe was a mismatch of expectations about
        the text, the implausible process it described, and the possibility of
        actually gaining insight from such an “implausible” recipe.</p>

    <p>Suddenly the author-practitioner of Ms. Fr. 640 looked really good in my
        eyes. He knew what he was doing in this entry. His bread molding recipe
        was cost-effective, practical, and eminently useful in replicating
        objects and playing around with their shapes in a low-stakes and
        low-cost medium. I later learned additional facts that further raised
        the manuscript’s author-practitioner in my esteem when I discussed our
        successful bread molding result with our Making and Knowing Project
        colleague, Larry Principe (Drew Professor of the Humanities at Johns
        Hopkins University in the Department of History of Science and
        Technology and the Department of Chemistry). Sulfur has certain
        properties that make it a useful material in experimental casting. It
        neither forms a dross (the scum that forms on molten metal) nor becomes
        friable upon reheating. Further research revealed the prevalence of
        sulfur use in early modern casting. Once I let go of my modern
        expectations around reading texts and working with materials, I came to
        see that this was not such an oddball recipe after all.<a href="#fn16"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref16"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
    <p>The “reveal” with the bread molding experiment was a humbling moment for
        me. Why was I so astounded by the result? Because I had dismissed the
        text as implausible before we even tried it, and because my first
        impression of reading the recipe did not align with my previous studio
        experiences. In retrospect, this first “official” experiment in the Lab
        Seminar marks the point where I began to think more deeply about the
        power of failure to transform intellectual risk-aversion (roughly
        translatable as “what do I need to do to demonstrate my intellectual
        competence and pass this course”) into risk-taking (“I wonder what
        trying X might show me, and how this might inform my project
        development”). For me, personally and intellectually, the bread molding
        exercise shone a bright light onto assumptions that I did not even
        realize I held, and revealed ways that doubt and dismissal had placed
        obstacles in the way of my curiosity. The bread molding experience not
        only impacted how I worked with our students, it started to change how I
        viewed my behavior and actions.</p>
    <p>The bread molding experiment also precipitated a shift in attitude in our
        students around fear of failure. This recipe affected a kind of research
        paradigm shift through which we started to appreciate the possibilities
        that material engagement as a research tool presented. Our class began
        to go off-roading with making bread and casting objects in it. They
        created complex molds (a Buddha statue, carved in the round (<i><u>Fig.
                10</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 11</u></i>) and a bust of Marx, among
        other things) and they combined various mixtures of sulfur, tallow, and
        beeswax (as suggested by the marginal note: “Try sulfur passed through
        melted wax”) in order to create different textures, colors, and
        densities to see what would happen with these material combinations.
        Some of these mixtures turned out to be impractical as they were too
        soft to be used as models for creating other molds. On the one hand,
        they represented failures in a technical sense. On the other hand, they
        acted as prompts for deeper textual interpretation through more material
        engagement. Failure from this perspective presented an invitation to
        experiment, to be curious without restraint or fear of the “wrong”
        outcome. Failure facilitated an openness to follow new paths of inquiry
        that might unexpectedly emerge.<a href="#fn17"

    <p>Failure can be a visible mismatch between expectations and results. In
        the case of <em>Craft and Science,</em> this mismatch involved a tension
        between the written instructions and their material realization. Also,
        the successful implementation of a set of instructions to produce a
        presentable reproduction might in fact yield less insight into the
        hidden knowledge of the past than failure to do so. The failures invited
        students to critically engage with the material conditions, sequence,
        and scaffolding of experimental instructions, and the question of when
        something was good enough to form a “proof of concept” that demonstrated
        the plausibility of a written historical recipe.</p>
    <h2 id="adapting-the-making-and-knowing-pedagogy">Adapting the Making and
        Knowing Pedagogy</h2>
    <p>The interdisciplinary nature of the Making and Knowing Project provides
        several ways in which its educational program can be adapted and
        transferred to other learning contexts. The centerpieces in this regard
        are the Lab Seminar and the dynamic community created by the expert
        maker residencies and the annual meetings of working groups. The
        potential transfer of elements from the Making and Knowing Project into
        other educational settings thus requires a note on their structure and
        organization.</p>
    <p>In the context of the Lab Seminar, students crafted their research essays
        for the production of a Digital Critical Edition of a specific, and
        complicated early modern practical text. This goal necessitated major
        funding and support for institutional coordination, project management,
        designated research space, conferences, staff, and so on (all the costs
        that also go into natural scientific research groups). That said, you do
        not need a sizable, major research grant to “do” the Making and Knowing
        Project. Adapting the Making and Knowing pedagogy is not about
        recreating the Making and Knowing Project, but rather about researching
        texts in a material way, and focusing on process in order to ask new
        kinds of questions. In my opinion, skill building and scaffolded project
        research constitute the most powerful and transplantable elements of
        this pedagogy for other projects at different educational levels and in
        other institutions. Two exercises from the Project exemplify this: the
        historical culinary reconstruction and bread molding, as described
        above. These exercises are relatively easy (and safe) to bring into any
        classroom and are readily modifiable based on the students’ access to a
        kitchen. The big takeaway here is not only about the importance of
        material engagement but bringing experiential learning back into
        humanities pedagogy.<a href="#fn18"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref18"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
    <p>The Making and Knowing Project’s methodology has also been successfully
        transferred to other educational contexts, notably in the example of
        Yingyi Liang, a student at the Princeton International School of
        Mathematics and Science (PRISMS), a STEM high school in Princeton, New
        Jersey. In 2017, Ms. Liang’s teacher Dr. Roxanne P. Spencer had read
        about the Making and Knowing Project in a <em>Chemical &amp; Engineering
            News</em> article.<a href="#fn19"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref19"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a> Dr. Spencer discerned Ms.
        Liang’s interest in working with metals and suggested she look into the
        Making and Knowing Project’s translation of Ms. Fr. 640 for her PRISMS
        capstone project. Dr. Spencer saw this as an opportunity for Ms. Liang
        to explore technical processes through analytical techniques included in
        the PRISMS curriculum, such as SEM (scanning electron microscope)
        imaging, made possible through a partnership with Princeton University
        that makes scientific equipment and training available to the PRISMS
        high school students.</p>
    <p>In creating her experiments, Ms. Liang toggled between trying to
        reconstruct the experiments of Making and Knowing Project students from
        their research essays and detailed field notes, and her own reading of
        the manuscript in English translation. What resulted was Ms. Liang’s own
        interpretation of the entries in Ms. Fr. 640 for sandcasting, defined by
        her own experimental impulse around conducting “erosion trials” of her
        own design that utilized SEM to observe the elemental compositions of
        the results (e.g., comparison of crystalline structures and
        identification of chemical components). Ms. Liang’s erosion trials
        introduced water into her tests, presenting her attempts to accelerate,
        mimic, and study the aging processes of her cast metal materials. This
        marked a departure from the manuscript’s sandcasting recipes even as Ms.
        Fr. 640 provided a springboard into new questions about metallic
        structure that Ms. Liang went on to explore. None of the “failures” Ms.
        Liang experienced over the course of her experimental casting deterred
        her in the least; rather, they served to spur her curiosity. Ms. Liang’s
        work presents a fascinating example of a high school student’s curiosity
        and delight in pushing boundaries. She was not content with simply
        following procedures discussed in the <em>Craft and Science</em> student
        essays, but more interested in pushing material limits to see what might
        result, and then to think about why that might be.<a href="#fn20"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref20"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
    <p>Interestingly, Ms. Liang found working with the Making and Knowing
        Project’s student essays relatively challenging, and in my view this
        mirrored the challenges that the Making and Knowing Project’s students
        experienced in striving to understand the author-practitioner. As Ms.
        Liang encountered what she discerned as gaps in information or lack of
        clarity in the <em>Craft and Science</em> procedures and records, she
        turned to the manuscript to puzzle out the process. In her own words,
        the procedures as described in the essays still required her “to do work
        to understand it,” and she was “looking to try to figure out the
        process” because the descriptions of the casting processes provided by
        the Project students were often hard for her to penetrate.<a
           href="#fn21"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref21"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a> These kinds of obstacles seem to
        have galvanized Ms. Liang’s curiosity and experimental impulse, and
        driven her to deeper engagement with the manuscript.</p>
    <p>Overall, the laboratory-based teaching of historical scholarship as
        embodied by the Making and Knowing Project and its offshoot with the
        PRISMS high school experiment emphasizes the power of open-ended
        exploration that can happen in this type of material investigation.
        Students and teachers need to engage the issue of risk-aversion in
        today’s educational structure. Hands-on research can be one way to
        encourage intellectual risk-taking—a skill that can be carried into any
        future professional pursuit a student may follow.<a href="#fn22"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref22"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
    <p>I have found that students tend to be very good at answering questions
        based on their knowledge of existing theoretical frameworks, rather than
        posing questions that stem from their own curiosity. My own pedagogical
        practice at the Gallatin School of Individualized Study at New York
        University provides examples of how skill building can foster community
        and teach intellectual risk-taking at the undergraduate level. My
        courses there in the history of science examine early modern
        knowledge-making practices, modes of investigating the natural world,
        and the role of intuition and imagination in the experimental process.
        They are structured around the student producing a final essay. With
        this capstone assignment, my students learn intellectual responsibility
        through the design of their own essay question (in consultation with me)
        that connects topics and readings from our course with their own
        academic concentration, which can be anything from music, biology,
        religious studies, computer science, or dance. The seemingly
        straightforward undertaking of posing an intelligent question is
        supported through two kinds of editing exercises: “Draw Something”
        (using images and objects) and “Draft Exchange” (text based). These
        exercises bookend the semester: usually, I start the term with the
        former, and run the latter towards the end of the course. Both exercises
        are weighted Pass/Fail: completion of the exercise criteria merits
        “Pass” (e.g., 5% towards the student’s participation grade); non- or
        incomplete participation results in 0%.</p>
    <p>Draw Something prepares the student for developing their final essay
        question by directing their attention to the editing process through
        visual and haptic engagement. The exercise has three components:</p>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Go to a museum exhibit; choose any object that captures their
                    interest; focus on an element, and draw it—on site, in the
                    gallery. In a remote learning setting, household objects or
                    things situated within the student’s vicinity provide useful
                    models as well.</p>
            </blockquote>
        </li>
        <li>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Write up a one-page reflection about the drawing experience.
                </p>
            </blockquote>
        </li>
        <li>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Present your reflections to the class in a two-minute account
                    of the experience that includes showing both an image of the
                    object you chose to render as well as your drawing. Should a
                    student be uncomfortable showing their drawing, they are
                    welcomed to keep that element of the assignment private from
                    the class.</p>
            </blockquote>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>In explaining the pedagogical rationale
        behind this skill building exercise to the students—that it is designed
        to help them explore and develop ideas and skills for writing their
        essays—I de-emphasize the need for perfection or even drawing ability.
        The point of the exercise is to observe and reflect upon what happens
        when you connect looking, thinking, and doing. I encourage the students
        to actively strive to disengage from concern over producing a picture
        that “looks good” and to focus, rather, on what they experienced during
        the process.</p>
    <p>The seemingly simple action of trying to render an image on paper attunes
        a person to the editing process. As you draw, you intuitively evaluate
        your work, instinctively making adjustments and changes. This manifests
        in different ways, such as adding or erasing lines and shadow. Or in
        making adjustments to your original plan (e.g., the realization that
        your original intention to draw that Bernini statue at the Met in its
        entirety was overly ambitious, hence your decision to focus only on the
        pedestal). Perhaps you will grasp details revealed through the necessary
        close looking. Perhaps your work produces feelings of “not good enough,”
        or you discover an ability you did not realize you had. All of this is
        relatable to the process of essay writing, where initial ideas must be
        made into manageable form, and the ability to recognize and develop
        insights gives depth to the content. Draw Something invites the student
        to take the time to think about the process of doing and the kind of
        knowledge this produces. This simple exercise exerts a profound effect
        on the students. I have run Draw Something in numerous classes since
        2014 and I am continually struck by how the drawing experience works to
        establish community in the classroom. Hearing one of your peers give
        voice to something that you yourself are feeling fosters trust and
        invites dialogue, essential ingredients for a vibrant seminar experience
        and a positive learning environment. The experience of the drawing
        exercise also serves as an important touchstone for the students as they
        develop their essays in written form.</p>
    <p>Writing requires a lot of feedback. The second skill building exercise,
        Draft Exchange, presents a different kind of model to students who are
        used to writing as a solitary endeavor, and where the instructor’s
        feedback is given as assessment of the completed assignment. I generally
        schedule this editing exercise about a month in advance of the final
        essay deadline. The exercise thus works to circumvent end of term panic
        where the final essay often gets produced in a sweaty mess the night
        before it is due.</p>
    <p>Draft Exchange requires the student to come to class with a printout of
        three to four double-spaced pages of their essay (the final essay length
        is approximately twelve pages, based on the challenging nature of
        producing a dozen pages of concise, meaningful, and insightful content).
        As with Draw Something, I de-emphasize polish and perfection in this
        draft, and stress the “work in progress” nature of the exercise. In
        class, I organize the students into pairs and give the partners time to
        read each other’s draft (approximately fifteen minutes). Thereafter they
        turn to comment on each other’s work (the robustness of the idea,
        organization of content, intellectual engagement with course readings).
        Students comment and make edits directly on their partner’s draft either
        with pencil and paper, or using tracked changes in an electronic copy.
        In remote learning situations, breakout rooms and collaborative editing
        on Google Docs works brilliantly for this exercise.</p>
    <p>As with Draw Something, in-class reflections constitute an important part
        of the Draft Exchange experience. We discuss what it feels like to have
        pushed through the first stage of pulling together the essay topic and
        its attendant ideas (always hard, always messy!), as well as what it is
        like to both give and receive feedback in a collaborative environment.
        In my experience, students come out of the Draft Exchange experience
        with a clearer sense of direction about how to proceed with developing
        and writing the final essay, and, significantly, with confidence that
        they have something worthwhile to say.</p>
    <p>Knowing how to ask an original thought-provoking question and
        understanding how to effectively develop it constitutes a valuable and
        transferable skill. Draw Something and Draft Exchange work together to
        provide the student with targeted opportunities during the course in
        which to engage in the dynamic and often organic process of
        <em>working</em> with an idea: it is not enough to have one, you need to
        know how to put it to use. Draw Something and Draft Exchange also
        humanize the process of thinking, writing, and communicating ideas. It
        gives students agency and allows them to share with one another the
        challenges, frustrations, and breakthroughs that are part of the process
        of making knowledge. Skill building in this context also provides the
        space where students learn to appreciate the careful labor that goes
        into developing an idea and seeing it through different iterations en
        route to completion.</p>
    <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The strength of the Making and Knowing Project is its processual and
        collaborative nature. It focuses on texts as guides toward practice,
        thereby raising a multitude of questions and opening up possible avenues
        to interpretation. Learning how to read a practical text as codified
        material practice invites us to rethink certain educational practices.
        Traditionally, humanities have taught close reading and interpretation
        by exploring the intellectual context and intertextuality of texts;
        Making and Knowing pedagogy inserts an active step into this close
        reading that forces students to confront the nature of a practical text
        as always inadequate in conveying its action in words. Instead, close
        reading of such a text must involve “doing” as well. This essay argues
        that incorporating “doing” into historical research has benefits beyond
        the study of practical texts such as Ms. Fr. 640. These benefits have to
        do with developing close reading, writing, and interpretive skills, such
        as explicit scaffolding of research assignments to make the processual
        nature of research and writing explicit, skill building as part of
        iterative design, and the consideration of evidence, which develops
        awareness and explicit acknowledgment of different levels of certainty
        in research. They also include more general pedagogical techniques, such
        as community building, the power of collaboration, asking new questions,
        open-ended explorations and risk-taking, appreciation of process both in
        material exploration and more generally in other types of research, and,
        finally, a recognition of the generative nature of trying, failing,
        reflecting, and trying, over and over again.</p>
    <p>The contribution of Making and Knowing pedagogy to academic training is
        to introduce into textual analysis ways that a text about materiality
        and making enables access to a past physical world. What is achieved by
        the consideration of materiality in Ms. Fr. 640 (be it reconstruction in
        laboratory seminars or interpretation of the manuscript’s meaning in
        paleography workshops) is the understanding of the text itself as a
        physical thing that can give rise to actual material things, rather than
        just words about those things. Through its amalgamation of archival and
        laboratory research, Making and Knowing pedagogy establishes historical
        connections between the early modern workshop and the modern day
        laboratory as sites of knowledge production. What also emerges from the
        laboratory seminars are surprising relationships between manuscripts and
        experiments in the material world. In all this, reflection—in addition
        to doing—is key.</p>
