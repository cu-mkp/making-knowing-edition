                of BnF Ms. Fr. 640 describes how to lay thick ink on paper,
                apply eau-de-vie, mold it, then cast it in metal. The purpose of
                “lifecast” paper with writing was not clear to the first cohort
                of students who reconstructed this procedure, however, over the
                course of two subsequent reconstructions of molding paper with
                raised letters, students gained further insight into this brief
                entry. These reconstructions considered and experimented with
                various materials in the entry, and compared this entry to
                others in the manuscript that show the author-practitioner’s
                concern with practical techniques for casting thin, delicate
                things, such as insect wings.</p>

    <p>The entry “Letters and molded paper” on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/131r/f/131r/tl"><u>131r</u></a>
        explains in just one sentence the process of laying thick ink onto a
        piece of paper and casting it into clay or plaster:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Letters and molded paper</p>
        <p>Write with well gummed ink or with any color which has body &amp;
            which does not erase once moistened with eau-de-vie. Then, place
            your paper on a clay slab &amp; moisten it with eau-de-vie and cast
            on one side &amp; the other.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>This entry seems to be without exact
        precedent in previous written sources, and it does not make clear its
        intended final product. While a reconstruction of “Letters and molded
        paper” sheds light on its possible outcome, it does not illuminate its
        purpose. The limited nature of the text suggests that the process was
        not a subject of careful experimentation. Rather, as this essay will
        suggest, this entry likely represents a less developed idea inspired by
        two broader groups of recipes in the manuscript: those related to the
        casting of thin things and those related to writing techniques and
        tricks.</p>

    <h3 id="ink">Ink</h3>
    <p>The entry starts with instructions to write with either well gummed ink
        (<em>ancre bien gommée</em>) or a colored liquid with body (<em>quelque
            couleur qui aye corps</em>). It is evident that the viscosity of the
        writing liquid is more important than its appearance, which implies that
        the paper onto which the ink is laid is unimportant to the final result.
        The recipe offers no indication of how to make <em>ancre bien
            gommée</em>, although for a contemporary reader, this may have
        seemed a straightforward process.</p>
    <p>As Jo Wheeler has noted, the majority of surviving Renaissance ink
        recipes are related to the making of iron gall ink, which had been used
        since the twelfth century and involved a combination of iron salts with
        gall from animal or plant sources.<a href="#fn1"

        the pseudonymous Alessio Piemontese (1555), for example, is filled with
        numerous ink recipes, each with different merits (cost-effective ink,
        white ink, etc.). One recipe, “To make ink to write that will allow you
        to make a large quantity, and very quickly, and at very little expense,
        and that will be perfect. And to make furthermore ink to print,” calls
        for the primary ingredient of fish gall, particularly that from ocean
        regions such as Venice.<a href="#fn3"

        gall, the <em>Secreti</em>&nbsp;calls for adding dust of cuttlefish or

        practice of varying the ingredients in ink to fit a desired purpose,
        writing surface, or color was common in this period. Recipes in numerous
        books of secrets call for some form of gum—typically gum arabic—to be
        added to ink to adjust its viscosity.<a href="#fn4"

    <p>The manuscript itself contains two recipes for making ink within a larger
        entry on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/51r/f/51r/tl"><u>51r</u></a>–<a

           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref6"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> The two recipes call for using
        linseed and walnut oil, respectively, and combining the oil with crushed
        garlic cloves and bread crusts. Because such ink was made expressly for
        the purpose of printing, in the reconstruction we decided to use an ink
        designed for writing. The primary properties of ink with which the
        author was concerned were its viscosity and its permanence when
        moistened. The recipe explicitly states that the ink must not run when
        moistened with brandy (eau-de-vie), and in a marginal note for a later
        recipe the author again discusses the need to use waterproof ink when
        molding paper (fol. <a

    <h3 id="gum">Gum</h3>
    <p>Selecting gum proved a greater challenge. Gum arabic seemed a natural
        choice, given the prevalence of gum arabic in this period, its use as an
        ingredient for ink in many books of secrets, and its specific mention on
        fols. <a

        gum arabic solution was found to have a diluting effect when mixed with
        ink (<i><u>Fig. 3</u></i>). Rather than forming raised letters, the
        surface of the ink remained flat, even when multiple layers of ink mixed
        with gum arabic were applied (<i><u>Fig. 4</u></i>). Other types of gum
        occur in the manuscript as well, for example, to dilute paint
        pigments.<a href="#fn9"

                &amp; Newton proved not to thicken the ink, a fact that is made
                clear on the packaging, which indicates that this solution is
                typically used for watercolor paints. © Making and Knowing

    <p>In the reconstruction we decided to find a different gum to increase the
        ink’s viscosity, and we therefore used powdered tragacanth gum mixed
        with water (<i><u>Fig. 5</u></i>). A resin derived from the sap of an
        eastern Mediterranean plant, tragacanth gum was available in Europe in
        the sixteenth century and was widely used. It is explicitly mentioned in
        Renaissance art treatises, often as a binding agent known for becoming
        hard with time,<a href="#fn10"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref10"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> and is used in recipes in Ms.
        Fr. 640 on fols. <a

           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/52r/f/52r/tl"><u>52r</u></a>.
        In our reconstruction, the tragacanth gum was mixed separately with both
        types of ink, forming a thick, gelatinous paste (<i><u>Fig. 6</u></i>,
        <i><u>Fig. 7</u></i>). Initially, we applied this mixture with a
        calligraphy pen, but the gum proved so viscous that it was necessary to
        paint it onto paper with a brush.</p>

    <p>After the ink dried over a period of several days, numerous changes took
        place. The ink shrank but remained thick and clearly raised above the
        surface of the paper. Although we applied the ink mixture to paper made
        of hemp and cotton fiber sized with gelatin<a href="#fn11"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref11"

        of sixteenth-century paper, the sheets curled up after the ink mixture
        hardened over several days (<i><u>Fig. 12</u></i>).<a href="#fn12"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref12"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> The curling of the paper may
        partly explain why the entry calls for dampening the sheet with brandy,
        a step which allowed the paper to relax in shape, albeit causing small
        cracks in the ink as it spread out. Brandy with a high alcohol content
        (92 proof) was used out of concern that the tragacanth gum was partly
        water soluble. An important question was when exactly to apply the
        brandy. As the sheet with writing was meant to be imprinted into a clay
        slab (<em>plastre d’ardille</em>), one might expect to apply the brandy
        to both sides of the paper before impressing it, as it would allow the
        paper to release from the clay more easily. The entry however seems to
        call for the opposite order of operations: “Then, place your paper on a
        clay slab &amp; moisten it with eau-de-vie and cast on one side &amp;
        the other.” While the curled paper relaxed in shape after the brandy was
        brushed on, our action of applying the brandy to the reverse of the
        paper after placing the paper on the clay may have created problems (<i><u>Fig. 13</u></i>).</p>

                The two slabs could not have interlocked with one another,

    <p>What was to be done next? Were the dry slabs of clay with an imprinted
        word the desired product? Their thinness made them brittle and
        impractical, causing one to break when handled (<i><u>Fig. 22</u></i>).
        It seems likely that such clay slabs would have been used as molds for a
        different substance such as plaster, which could simply have been poured
        onto the clay. The instruction to cast both sides of the paper may
        indicate that the author intended for the mold to be cast in two
        dimensions with the clay sheets pressed together. It may be that the
        clay was meant to have been inserted into a box mold or some other form.
        Such unknowns suggest that this entry was not subject to rigorous
        experimentation.</p>

    <p>It is noteworthy that the manuscript folio on which the entry is found is
        very clean, with no strikethroughs in the main body of the text, as
        occur frequently on many other pages of Ms. Fr. 640. Furthermore, the
        entry should be considered in relation to that immediately above it,
        which is entitled “Plants that are awkward to burn in the mold,” and
        offers one sentence of instructions to mold such objects “in two to
        three casts.” The word <em>essay</em> (trial or try) in the margin
        adjacent to the plant-molding recipe likely indicates that the
        author-practitioner meant to try the plant recipe, suggesting that he
        copied these recipes from another source, or without having actually
        tried them himself.<a href="#fn13"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref13"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> This hypothesis is supported by
        the brevity of the recipes on this folio. Alternatively, the
        author-practitioner may have meant to encourage another reader to try
        the experiment on his own.</p>
    <p>One might surmise that the entry for molding paper with raised letters on
        fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/131r/f/131r/tl"><u>131r</u></a>
        was simply a “thought experiment,” an idea jotted down without empirical
        testing. The sources for such an idea are likely not textual, as no
        exact precedent for this technique in printed books could be found.
        Rather, this entry seems closely related first to a number of recipes
        related to writing found much earlier in the manuscript: on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/19v/f/19v/tl"><u>19v</u></a>
        a recipe titled “For writing as well from the left as from the right”
        states: “Write as best you can with well-gummed ink on as many little
        cards as you want <em>
            <del>[illegible]</del>
        </em> to write words. &amp; once each letter is well saturated with ink,
        put it down on your paper &amp; rub with a tooth the back of the card.”
        This recipe provides a nearly identical process to that described in the
        first half of the entry on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/131r/f/131r/tl"><u>131r</u></a>,
        to create an imprint of inked words on another surface. It is
        significant that on fol. 19v the recipe explicitly focuses on using this
        technique to reverse the direction of the writing, as this same process
        obviously occurred when reconstructing the entry on fol. 131r. In the
        case of the entry on fol. 131r, however, if something were cast into the
        clay impression, it would emerge with the writing again facing in the
        normal direction. This may indicate why the reversal of text was not
        explicitly discussed on fol. 131r.</p>
    <p>The manuscript features an additional group of entries related to writing
        that show the author’s broader concern with practical techniques related
        to this process. Fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/46v/f/46v/tl"><u>46v</u></a>
        presents a series of such recipes, “Scribe, Oil of sulfur” (used to
        clean a quill), “Shoemaker” (writing permanent text on shoes), “Erasing
        a letter” (removing previously written text), “Writing without ink,”
        “Making a letter <em>à jour</em> on paper and other work,” and at the
        end of the page, “On stone, black letters.” All such recipes are
        composed of very brief descriptions with no strikethroughs or marginal
        notes, and many of them involve the same material: oil of sulfur, or
        sulfuric acid.<a href="#fn14"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref14"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> It is difficult to know how
        thoroughly these recipes were actually tested, although the entries
        reflect knowledge of the properties of sulfuric acid and its potential
        uses. The entry “Shoemaker” on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/46v/f/46v/tl"><u>46v</u></a>
        employs the third-person to describe the process of writing on shoes,
        beginning: “If he wants to do some tanned work on black leather shoes,
        he can dip a writing quill in oil of sulfur and paint with it what he
        would like on shoes, boots, and <em>colets</em>.” It may be that the
        author learned about oil of sulfur from a shoemaker and experimented
        with this material in developing his own writing tricks.<a href="#fn15"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref15"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> Another possibility is that the
        author speaks of a hypothetical shoemaker who could use a technique the
        author himself discovered when using sulfuric acid, just as a scribe the
        author-practitioner mentions in an earlier entry on fol. 46v could have
        used sulfuric acid to clean quills. In either case, the entries on this
        folio show a primary concern with the material, oil of sulfur, as a
        substance for writing. While some of these writing techniques may seem
        playful or trivial, there are numerous examples of recipes in books of
        secrets for erasing ink, as well as for the production of invisible ink,
        among other such “tricks.”<a href="#fn16"

        also relates to the author-practitioner’s interest in molding very thin
        materials, which is borne out in numerous recipes on nearby folios in
        the manuscript. On fol. <a

        in an entry on “Molding grasshoppers and things too thin,” the
        author-practitioner begins,</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>If you have a written paper to mold that is too thin, after you have
            made the first cast &amp; it has set, give a little thickness to the
            reverse of your paper with melted butter, which is the most
            appropriate means there is, &amp; for fortifying the wings of either
            a butterfly or a grasshopper, or some delicate part of an animal to
            which you need to give thickness. But take heed to apply this melted
            butter underneath the wing or in whichever place it cannot be seen.

        author is developing a set of techniques for casting such delicate and

        understandable difficulties in molding and casting thin items.<a

        cast of paper. It is thus understandable that the author would recommend
        a shortcut for casting thin items, as he does in a separate recipe for
        molding a fly, noting that if its wings are imperfect, they can be
        repaired by cutting out a small piece from flattened metal.<a

        however, such a shortcut would have been impossible, as the objective

        <strong>Further Experimentation</strong> — <strong>Baris Gokturk

    <p>Baris Gokturk made significant advances in interpreting the procedure,
        which are detailed in the following excerpt of his essay, edited by

    <h3 id="the-hand-of-the-author-practitioner">The Hand of the
        Author-Practitioner</h3>
    <p>The prompt to write on a piece of paper impels a short processual moment
        that is then fixed as a form of gestural artifact in cast metal. Casting
        a piece of writing forms an intriguing trajectory from the fluid gesture
        of the hand that leaves a mark on paper to the sculptural object that is
        eventually cast in metal. I wished to consider the individual gesture of
        writing by hand, today often thought of as an extension of the body and
        the unique identity of a writer, and the ambition in this entry to fix
        it in metal. Can the cast handwriting that is the aim of this entry be
        compared to a portrait medal, or a painted or sculpted portrait, or even
        to a coin that represents state power? Is it an attempt to fix the
        author-practitioner’s “hand” in metal, something like the maker’s mark
        on a piece of metalwork?</p>
    <p>My reconstruction showed that the intersection between handwriting,
        signature, and identity was somewhat different than I suspected. The
        fluid gesture of the hand that I had imagined being captured in the
        final metal cast was very different from the sculptural processes of
        working with “well gummed ink,” which put the final object not too
        distant from a lifecast lizard in its creation and final form. And yet,
        what is the meaning of the artisan’s hand—is it a fluid stroke that
        carries meaning as an extension of the maker, or is it something else?
    </p>
    <p>With this question in mind, I reconstructed the entry, staying alert to
        how much the author-practitioner’s hand was present in the process as an
        extension of his identity in the form of his handwriting. I was
        intrigued by the possibility of capturing a gesture that is an extension
        of the body, as opposed to a living thing outside the body (as in
        lifecasting), and of capturing the self in the act of making/creating by
        transforming fluid and momentary gesture into static and fixed object. I
        therefore planned to track the process from the fluidity and the
        originality of handwriting manifested in the first part of the text to
        the static mold-constrained fixity of its casting in metal at the end of
        the process. The relationship of this process to casting “things too
        thin” and casting from life was also relevant</p>
    <h3 id="reconstruction">Reconstruction</h3>
    <p>Two previous annotations deal with molded letter paper, one by Raymond
        Carlson and Jordan Katz in 2014, focusing on the entry on fol.<a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/131r/f/131r/tl"><u>131r</u></a>,
        and the other by Shiye Fu and Zhiqi Zhang in 2015 that treats the entry
        on <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/142v/f/142v/tl"><u>142v</u></a>
        and focuses on the marginal note which instructs to “write with cinnabar
        wetted with oil on oiled paper &amp; press in.” The main focus for Fu
        and Zhang was the molding and casting of things too thin in the form of
        pansies. Their reconstruction, done a year after Carlson and Katz,
        directly refers to the reconstruction that preceded them and reuses some
        of the same ingredients that were still available in the lab. At the
        same time, they point out a contradiction in the author-practitioner’s
        instructions between the entries on fols. 131r and 142v in the use of
        gum. On fol. 142v, the author-practitioner advises against the use of
        gum, replacing it with cinnabar mixed with oil for the writing.<a
           href="#fn22"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref22"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
    <p>I was able to solve some of the questions left hanging by Carlson and
        Katz. The answers to these questions came through reconsidering the
        materials and procedures. As detailed above, Carlson and Katz used gum
        arabic to achieve “well gummed ink,” a common type of gum in the period.
        However, they used a modern gum arabic medium made specifically for
        watercolors (Fig. 3). This gum arabic in liquid form proves too watery
        and fails to build thick letters to be cast, even after being laid on in
        several layers (Fig. 4). They ultimately switched to powdered tragacanth
        gum and achieved better results (Figs. 8–11). Fu and Zhang, for their
        part, also used tragacanth gum, then cross-referenced a second recipe on
        fol. 142v and added linseed oil to their mix of venetian red pigment and
        tragacanth gum in another misunderstanding of the recipe, which
        nevertheless gave them satisfactory results. With the background of
        these two previous trials, I decided to use powdered gum arabic in my
        reconstruction.<a href="#fn23"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref23"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
    <p>The main question left open by Carlson and Katz’s reconstruction was the
        process of making the mold. The entire entry in Ms. Fr. 640 is very
        short, but the passage on casting is especially brief: “Then, place your
        paper on a clay slab &amp; moisten it with eau-de-vie and cast on one
        side &amp; the other.” While these instructions were reasonably taken by
        Carlson and Katz to mean that impressions should be made in a clay slab
        (Figs. 14–20), I realized that this process definitely belongs to the
        family of recipes dealing with lifecasting, and that “cast on one side
        &amp; the other” was to be understood as an instruction to make the mold
        in the same way that other thin things, such as beetles, leaves, and
        pansies were cast, that is, posed and arranged on a clay slab,
        surrounded by clay walls, into which plaster is cast, first on one side,
        then on the other, to create a two-piece plaster mold. Fu and Zhang,
        because they were working on lifecasting, had realized this before I
        did, and they had succeeded in making a cast of paper with writing on
        it, although their molten tin alloy did not fill the entire mold. In
        this third reconstruction, I therefore intended to try to cast the
        writing in one full successful lead-tin alloy cast, however time did not
        permit the cast to be carried out, so the mold is still waiting to be
        cast as of this essay’s writing.</p>
    <p>Upon the close reading of the recipe itself and the two previous
        reconstructions, and based on my interest in investigating the
        transformation from the fluid state of the writing (fluid both in
        material and in metaphorical terms) to the static final state of the
        cast, as well as the relationship between the spontaneous and the
        crafted, I decided to focus on two aspects that required clarification
        in the previous reconstructions: the viscosity of the gum and ink
        mixture, and the making of the two-piece mold.</p>
    <p>In reconstructing with the knowledge of the two previous reconstructions,
        my intention was to explore the materials used to apply the writing, as
        well as the consistency, strength, and viscosity of the “well gummed
        ink.” I thus experimented with the ratio of ink to gum arabic, in order
        to increase both fluidity and thickness of the ink. I mixed both iron
        gall ink and powdered pigment with powdered gum arabic in two separate
        formulas (<i><u>Fig. 23</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 24</u></i>). The word I
        chose to spell out was “BODY” (<i><u>Fig. 25</u></i>).</p>

    <p>I discovered that one could apply the mixture onto paper in layers, thus
        building up the writing surface little by little. Adding warm water in
        the beginning so the ink would adhere to the paper, then adding more gum
        in layers to build thickness were effective strategies. This, however,
        made the whole process very different from my previous assumption that
        the writing would be captured as a flowing hand with an expression of
        individual identity. It instead was a step-by-step, careful process of
        building layers (<i><u>Fig. 26</u></i>).</p>

    <p>I began my reconstruction with the assumption that the recipe captured a
        moment of the author-practitioner’s individuality in the form of his
        handwriting by turning his touch into a cast artifact in a way similar
        to other lifecasts from nature. However, upon completing the
        reconstruction, I was convinced that any potential mark of individuality
        lay elsewhere, in the process of carefully ensuring that the letters
        were raised well by working them meticulously in layers.</p>
    <p>Instead of a mimetic process by which the original and personal gesture
        of the author-practitioner was turned into an artifact (a process
        perhaps analogous to his writing of the manuscript itself), the action
        of the hand and its uniqueness lay elsewhere: in the application of
        these subsequent layers and the careful building of smooth and even
        surfaces (<i><u>Fig. 27</u></i>).</p>

    <h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
    <p>Through the labor and necessary care my reconstruction entailed, I came
        to realize that where I had seen the signature of the hand as the mark
        of creativity before I started, by the end of my reconstruction, my
        understanding had shifted. I came to see that proficiency in craft was
        an indicator of the artisan’s identity, and this proficiency recorded
        his particular bodily gestures and gestural knowledge. I came to
        experientially understand that the identity of the artisan, and the
        significance of that identity in relation to an artisan’s craft, lay not
        in a spontaneous creative and individual gesture, marked by a quick
        signature, but instead in the careful accuracy and perfection of his
        work to produce a consummate object, a masterpiece.</p>
    <p>In reconstructing “Letters and molded paper,” the process of shaping the
        letters in layers while still keeping them clean and in proper shape
        brought me to an appreciation of the type of work that creates the
        virtuosity of molding “things too thin.” I realized that lifecasting—the
        recipe group to which molding lettered paper oddly belongs in the
        manuscript—necessitates similarly meticulously executed care. Its
        virtuosity lies in transforming that careful labor into a final object
        that appears to have been caught in the midst of life and nature itself.
        The creative act of such a work is to give the impression that the
        artist has simply transformed life into a durable simulacrum, eliding
        the careful labor of the artisan’s body that has gone into that
        transformation.<a href="#fn24"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref24"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a> That the author-practitioner
        understood virtuosity in this sense is indicated by his frequent use of
        the term “curieux” and “curieusement” (fols. 100r, 157r, 64r, 112v, 99r,
        113r, 52v,148v, 97v, 142r, 86r, 117r, 113v, and 66r). While “curious”
        and “curiosity” were beginning to be associated in new ways with virtue,
        ingenuity, and creativity at the end of the sixteenth century, the
        author-practitioner of Ms. Fr. 640 uses them only in the older
        sense—close to their Latin root of <em>cura</em>—to mean care and
        careful execution.<a href="#fn25"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref25"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
    <p>My initial interest in “Letters and molded paper” had arisen out of my
        fascination with the way in which the process aimed to transform the act
        of writing as a fleeting expression of a unique individual into a
        durable artifact. Through the reconstruction, I learned that the
        author-practitioner’s brief account aimed for an object that could only
        be achieved by meticulous and laborious processes of making. This is
        where the real individual mark of the maker, “his signature,” is
        located. The reconstruction made clear that the labor one had to
        exercise to create the illusion of effortlessness was the mark of the
        artist (and perhaps brought a sense of his own creativity), rather than
        what had been my initial fascination—the individual authenticity of the
        handwriting and the message it signalled. Instead, in my new
        understanding, the medium was the message.</p>
