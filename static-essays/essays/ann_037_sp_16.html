            <p>This essay explores the uses of a resinous material known as
                “dragon’s blood” in Ms. Fr. 640. Placing the relevant entries
                from the manuscript—including among others fols. <a

                the context of sixteenth-century discussions of dragon’s blood
                in botany and medicine, it shows that its applications as a
                remedy and a colorant were informed by its material properties
                and symbolic correspondences between red, gold, and blood. An
                experimental exploration of its properties suggests possible
                explanations for its uses as a remedy and as an ingredient in
                colored varnishes.</p>

    <p>An ingredient called <em>sang de dragon</em> or “dragon’s blood” appears
        in seven different recipes in Ms. Fr. 640 (e.g., fols. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/29v/f/29v/tl"><u>29v</u></a>,
        <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/38v/f/38v/tl"><u>38v</u></a>).
        Among these recipes, the author-practitioner gives instructions to stop
        a bleeding nose by applying a powder of dragon’s blood.<a href="#fn1"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref1"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> This application of dragon’s
        blood stands out in a manuscript that is otherwise largely focused on
        the production of materials and objects, but it is not alone, as close
        to forty other recipes in the manuscript give instructions for cures,
        preventatives, and cosmetic remedies.<a href="#fn2"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref2"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> Because dragon’s blood appears in
        such a range of applications, and because the nosebleed cure seems to be
        as much about this fantastical-sounding ingredient as it is about
        nosebleeds, dragon’s blood as a material presents a good focus for an
        inquiry into medicine in this manuscript. By investigating the
        juxtaposition of dragon’s blood as a medicament, as a “strong dye,” and
        as a source of “beautiful violet” in Ms. Fr. 640, we can gain insight
        into the larger thought processes that led to such a collection of
        recipes. In its capacity as a colorant and a curative, dragon’s blood
        straddles the artificial boundaries between craft making and medicine,
        and between the realms of “art” and “science.” To explore the
        author-practitioner’s understanding and use of dragon’s blood, I give an
        overview of dragon’s blood as a medicine in the pre-modern western
        tradition, investigate what was known in the late sixteenth century
        about dragon’s blood and its origins, and experiment with the material
        itself.</p>
    <h2 id="dragons-blood-and-ms.-fr.-640">Dragon’s Blood and Ms. Fr. 640</h2>
    <p>Dragon’s blood is the dried resin of any of a number of trees
        colloquially known as the “Dragon Tree”<a href="#fn3"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref3"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> (<i><u>Fig. 1</u></i>). Since at
        least the first century CE this resin was available in Europe as a
        product of the species <em>Dracaena draco, Dracaena cinnabari,</em> and
        likely <em>Daemonorops draco</em>, initially from the island of Socotra,
        and then, as European voyages expanded toward east and west in the
        fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, from the Canary Islands as well.<a
           href="#fn4"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref4"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> The resin is a dark red color,
        typically with visible veins and color variation—perhaps this is what
        the author-practitioner intended to convey in his small pen-and-ink
        sketch in the margin of fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/29v/f/29v/tl"><u>29v</u></a>
        (<i><u>Fig. 2</u></i>). Dragon’s blood can feel chalky and waxy to the
        touch (<i><u>Fig. 3</u></i>). Throughout the medieval and early modern
        periods, dragon’s blood was employed as a colorant to make red, although
        it was not favored over vermilion, brazilwood, or cochineal.<a

    <p>The seven appearances of dragon’s blood in Ms. Fr. 640 present an
        intriguing range of techniques, and they are presented here in order of
        their appearance on the text’s folios.<a href="#fn6"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref6"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> The first is “Doublets” on fol.
        <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/7r/f/7r/tl"><u>7r</u></a>,
        which briefly explains that dragon’s blood, when soaked in spirits, can
        be used as a glue, and, as the title of the recipe implies, this glue
        would be used to connect two halves of an imitation gem to make a
        “doublet.”<a href="#fn7"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref7"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> The next appearance is on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/29v/f/29v/tl"><u>29v</u></a>,
        where the material is fully introduced in a recipe entitled “Dragon’s
        blood.” This recipe explains how to prepare dragon’s blood for use—as in
        the “doublet” recipe, many applications require that it be soaked in
        alcohol—and how to select good quality samples for purchase. The copious
        notes on this recipe recommend applying it to gold. Next, on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/38v/f/38v/tl"><u>38v</u></a>,
        the recipe “Against nosebleed and for dyeing” provides the only
        medicinal use of dragon’s blood, instructing the reader to apply ground
        dragon’s blood to a nosebleed, and then immediately suggests that the
        same stuff can also be used as a violet dye. On fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/40v/f/40v/tl"><u>40v</u></a>,
        the recipe entitled “Cross of the commanders of Malta” gives detailed
        instructions for producing a shiny, enamel-like material from a dragon’s
        blood solution and applying it to silver sheets, presumably in order to
        make the eponymous cross.<a href="#fn8"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref8"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> On fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/98r/f/98r/tl"><u>98r</u></a>,
        “Varnish for lutes” gives a similar recipe for a varnish that, colored
        with dragon’s blood, can be used as a red-tinted coating for wood. Fol.
        <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/102v/f/102v/tl"><u>102v</u></a>,
        “Painting on crystal or glass,” is the only explicit use of dragon’s
        blood as a colorant, but as in other recipes, it is used particularly
        for application on a material other than a canvas or panel, and it is
        used in combination with metal leaf. The final recipe to mention
        dragon’s blood (on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/165r/f/165r/tl"><u>165r</u></a>)
        is, as on fol. 29v, entitled “Dragon’s blood,” but the instructions here
        are for imitating the effect of dragon’s blood on gold or silver by
        using lake pigment, and do not involve the material itself.</p>
    <p>The recipes on fols. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/29v/f/29v/tl"><u>29v</u></a>
        and <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/38v/f/38v/tl"><u>38v</u></a>
        particularly highlight the range of uses for dragon’s blood by
        introducing this material’s medicinal application and explaining
        important visual cues that signal its efficacy. Fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/38v/f/38v/tl"><u>38v</u></a>
        presents a very short recipe, which simply states that when someone
        suffers from a nosebleed, one should “pestle some sorrel or <em>lapathum
            acutum</em> of the sort that is red-veined, which is called dragon’s
        blood, and apply it to the forehead of the one who bleeds.” This recipe
        appears on a page that includes a number of recipes on dyeing. The
        context of these other recipes would suggest, then, that this medical
        application of dragon’s blood is secondary to the rest of the entry,
        which says: “This herb is a strong dye &amp; makes beautiful violet.” It
        is possible that this capacity to stop bleeding is in some way related
        to the use of dragon’s blood as a dye, and this may also be a signal
        that the color of dragon’s blood, which is described here as both red
        and violet, is an indicator of its use. In contrast, the recipe on fol.
        <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/29v/f/29v/tl"><u>29v</u></a>
        is much longer and more detailed. It comes at the bottom of a page after
        a series of recipes on gold and other metals, and its three marginal
        notes completely fill the open space around the main text. It details
        how to prepare dragon’s blood for use on gold (by dissolving it in
        eau-de-vie) and how it can be bought (in large chunks resembling pieces
        of cake). These instructions reinforce the importance of the red color
        and introduce the application of dragon’s blood on gold. The marginal
        notes reinforce these features: the first indicating again that the
        darker the color, the better the product, the second clarifying how to
        dissolve it in eau-de-vie, and the third explaining more fully how to
        apply it to gold.</p>
    <p>All seven recipes, despite being scattered throughout the manuscript,
        signal the importance of the red color of dragon’s blood and its
        relation to gold. Dragon’s blood appears in association with gold or
        silver in four of these recipes (<a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/29v/f/29v/tl"><u>29v</u></a>,
        <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/40v/f/40v/tl"><u>40v</u></a>,
        <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/102v/f/102v/tl"><u>102v</u></a>,
        and <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/165r/f/165r/tl"><u>165r</u></a>).
        As described above, fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/29v/f/29v/tl"><u>29v</u></a>,
        which introduces dragon’s blood as a material, gives its only
        application as a varnish to gold; where fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/165r/f/165r/tl"><u>165r</u></a>
        gives instructions for imitating dragon’s blood, it does so only in the
        context of applying it to gold or silver. The importance of the color of
        dragon’s blood is emphasized or implied in every recipe. When the
        author-practitioner describes what a “well chosen tear” of dragon’s
        blood should look like, he says it should show off its “transparent red”
        (fol. 29v). Similarly, the effect created by dragon’s blood on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/40v/f/40v/tl"><u>40v</u></a>
        is referred to as “rouge clair,” indicating the translucent red of the
        much valued vitreous enamel. On fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/98r/f/98r/tl"><u>98r</u></a>,
        dragon’s blood is added to varnish to “make it reddish,” where it must
        be translucent in order that the red varnish will not obscure the wood
        grain of the lute, and, on fol. 102v, it is painted on one side of glass
        or crystal to create a “quickly-done red,” and a leaf of topaz, gold, or
        silver is applied to the other side, which, again, the dragon’s blood
        paint must not entirely obscure. On fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/7r/f/7r/tl"><u>7r</u></a>,
        the dragon’s blood mastic must be translucent or it would spoil the
        effect of light passing through the false jewel. The recipe on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/38v/f/38v/tl"><u>38v</u></a>
        does not directly imply that the translucent red of dragon’s blood is
        important to its function; rather, it presents the convergence of red
        substance and blood as a like-for-like means of healing.</p>
    <h2 id="blood-gold-and-the-color-red">Blood, Gold, and the Color Red</h2>
    <p>These features of dragon’s blood—its association with gold and its
        blood-like, translucent red appearance—point to a larger system of
        knowledge in which the author-practitioner is participating with his
        varied applications for the substance. Pamela Smith refers to this as
        “vernacular science” or “a web of correspondences among red, blood, and
        gold that can be teased out of artisanal recipes and practices.”<a
           href="#fn9"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref9"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> Smith draws attention to the
        intersection of red color, blood, and gold in the production and writing
        of both vernacular and learned traditions in the early modern era to
        show the intersection between practice and theory in the production of
        knowledge about nature at this time. The manufacture of products in
        imitation of nature could itself be a way of learning about, and even
        harnessing, the properties of materials.<a href="#fn10"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref10"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> Gold and blood, and by extension
        the color red, were associated with the maintenance of life and heat in
        living beings.<a href="#fn11"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref11"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> In the manuscript, dragon’s
        blood is often used in recipes involving red and gold that are intended
        to create a plausible imitation of another product. The translucency of
        dragon’s blood is particularly important to this formula, as the ability
        to let light shine through livens up the manufactured jewels and painted
        surfaces for which the author-practitioner gives instructions.<a
           href="#fn12"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref12"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
    <p>By extension, naturally occurring red substances came to be used in the
        treatment of bleeding. Smith points, for instance, to Albertus Magnus’s
        instruction to wear a piece of coral around the neck, which is “good
        against epilepsy and the action of menstruation.”<a href="#fn13"

        Salerno, Italy. It includes six separate recipes involving dragon’s
        blood, which offer remedies for uterine ulcers, excessive menstruation,
        and loss of virginity.<a href="#fn19"

        appears in conjunction with a number of other plant and animal
        substances, particularly pomegranate and Armenian bole. These
        applications display some of the same features of dragon’s blood as in
        Ms. Fr. 640, such as the capacity to stop blood flow (in menstruation
        and presumably in uterine ulcers), and the ability to turn something
        golden (as in hair dye). Two recipes also indicate that dragon’s blood
        works as an astringent or in some way to constrict flesh, as when it is
        given to restore virginity and to tighten the vagina, and it is possible
        that this constrictive ability is what enables it to stop bleeding.
        Dragon’s blood is invoked somewhat less frequently in the <em>Canon of
            Medicine</em>, an eleventh-century Arabo-Persian medical textbook
        that was in use in western Europe through the eighteenth century. Its
        single appearance in this text is as part of a concoction placed on the
        cut site of the umbilical cord to prevent it from bleeding out.<a
           href="#fn21"

        accompanied by yellow spices—turmeric and cumin—and it is mentioned in
        no other kinds of applications, likely because this text was strictly
        medical. Again, the dragon’s blood is used to halt bleeding, and,
        specifically, to help the wound develop a seal.</p>
    <p>Consistent with these medieval texts, port books and ledgers show that
        dragon’s blood was in increasingly high demand in England, and probably
        other parts of Europe, from the latter half of the sixteenth century
        into the eighteenth.<a href="#fn22"

        century at over two thousand pounds per year, up from almost six hundred
        pounds per year in the last decade of the sixteenth century, and then
        fell back to just over seven hundred pounds per year in the middle of
        the eighteenth century. It is not clear whether this trajectory of the

        Modern studies of dragon’s blood agree with this assessment: Gupta et
        al. found that a number of species of dragon tree are effective
        antiseptics, analgesics, and, in some cases, hemostatics, though,
        curiously, this last quality was not found in any of the
        <em>Dracaena</em> species that were the most popular sources of dragon’s
        blood in the medieval and early modern periods.<a href="#fn46"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref46"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>46</sup></a> Edward et al. claim that
        dragon’s blood from the <em>Dracaena draco</em> tree possesses

        were the result of collecting the resin in liquid form from the tree,
        and they postulate that benzoic acid could be activated within dragon’s
        blood when heated, as may occur when the raw form is compressed into
        cakes or rods.<a href="#fn48"

    <p>To explore how the qualities described by medical, botanical, and modern
        scientific sources determine the material effects of dragon’s blood, I
        conducted a set of experiments to test dragon’s blood as it is used in
        the manuscript. I was primarily interested in its ability to transfer
        color and its interactions with blood and flesh, since these seemed to
        be its most noteworthy features. As per the instructions in the
        “Dragon’s Blood” recipe on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/29v/f/29v/tl"><u>29v</u></a>,
        I soaked samples of dragon’s blood in 40 proof liquor (<i><u>Fig. 8</u></i>) and then set aside other samples to be mixed with turpentine, as
        instructed on fols. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/40v/f/40v/tl"><u>40v</u></a>
        and <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/98r/f/98r/tl"><u>98r</u></a>
        (<i><u>Fig. 9</u></i>), with tap water as a control (<i><u>Fig. 10</u></i>). I stained strips of undyed cotton with each solution to observe
        color transfer and note any other physical effects (<i><u>Fig. 11</u></i>). This experiment revealed alcohol to be the most successful color
        transfer medium by far, yielding shades of orange, deep red, and pink,
        depending on the degree of contact with the solution. The dragon’s
        blood, however, would only completely dissolve in the turpentine, which
        turned its color a murky brown and left a sticky residue on the cotton.
        Not only did the dragon’s blood not dissolve in the water, but it barely
        mixed with it—the powder remained floating on top, mostly dry. From this
        set of experiments I discovered the hydrophobic qualities of dragon’s
        blood and the tacky quality of the dissolved material, which my next
        experiment suggests is the reason it is capable of stopping blood
        flow.<a href="#fn50"

        ground dragon’s blood could be applied to a bloody nose in order to stop
        the bleeding. To test the interaction of dragon’s blood with blood and
        flesh, I applied ground dragon’s blood to pieces of beef heart. To
        explore the range of interaction between the dragon’s blood and the
        meat, I also applied salt to one piece, both salt and dragon’s blood to
        another piece, and left a piece bare. I allowed these to sit for twenty
        minutes, giving the salt enough time to draw more blood out of the meat.
        I found that the meat with dragon’s blood alone was drier on its surface
        than the meat with nothing on it; the meat with dragon’s blood and salt
        was slightly wet; and the meat with just salt was sitting in a small
        puddle of liquid (<i><u>Fig. 12</u></i>). Although this experiment does
        not accurately mimic the biological processes of a nosebleed, it does
        suggest that the dragon’s blood is capable of forming a barrier that
        keeps fluid contained.<a href="#fn51"

    <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>From contemporary sources and modern experiments, it is apparent that the
        uses of dragon’s blood in Ms. Fr. 640 exploited its capacities as a
        material. While it is possibly a coincidence that this ingredient was
        effective as both a pigment and a hemostatic, further research into the
        use of dragon’s blood as a dye<a href="#fn52"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref52"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>52</sup></a> and as a paint colorant could
        reveal ways in which its astringency and hydrophobia may have been
        useful for its role as a pigment. However, as became clear in the course
        of my experiments, using dragon’s blood in multiple ways revealed new
        aspects of this material that were neither apparent from its appearance
        nor explicitly discussed within the early modern literature. These
        varied applications for dragon’s blood therefore represent a range of
        material properties that become clear through practice, and it may be
        that these properties fostered further experimentation on the part of
        the author-practitioner with this material.<a href="#fn53"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref53"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>53</sup></a></p>
    <p>We should not underestimate the role of theory and belief either, for the
        author-practitioner’s interest in dragon’s blood may also have come from
        understandings beyond its purely material properties.<a href="#fn54"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref54"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>54</sup></a> Indeed, the interplay among the
        practices and techniques of artisans in the production of crafts, the
        theories of medicine contained in herbals, and deeper cultural
        beliefs—such as the association between red and gold—offer tantalizing
        glimpses into the systems of knowledge that underpin Ms. Fr. 640.<a

                <p>While Paracelsus is the most well-known and perhaps most

                <p>Bucklow has suggested that dragon’s blood itself was a
                    material of alchemical significance within this theory of
                    healing because its red color signified that as a substance
                    it was the perfect balance of opposing qualities. Bucklow,

                <p>The Latin names translate to “sorrel,” the leaves of which
                    often have red veins. It is not clear in this context
                    whether the author-practitioner is suggesting that this is
                    the same material as dragon’s blood, a fact that is further
                    complicated by his referring to the latter as an “herb,” by
                    which he could mean only that it comes from a plant, or,
                    that it is the leafy part of a plant. However, this kind of
                    conflation between dragon’s blood and other red plants was

                <p>Mattioli makes a linguistic distinction here between “le sang
                    du Dragon” and “Sang de Dragon:” the first literally means
                    “the blood of a dragon” and the other more colloquially
                    suggests “dragon’s blood.” He enunciates this distinction in
                    explaining the two origin stories for the substance, as he
                    only uses the phrase “le sang du Dragon” when describing the
                    blood of the dragon that mixes with the blood of the
                    elephant. Otherwise, whenever he refers to the substance of
                    dragon’s blood, he uses the phrase “Sang de Dragon.”

                    of what would become Latin America, and so the sample
                    Clusius observed was likely from this variety, which was
                    used in Mexico as a vulnerary and astringent. Wallert and
