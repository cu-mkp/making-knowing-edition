        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <div>
            <p>This essay focuses on the entry “<em>Carton</em>” on fol. <a
                   href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/81r/f/81r/tl"><u>81r</u></a>,
                which describes how paper can be pulped and molded in a cavity.
                This description at first appears similar to the process of
                using paper that later became known as papier-mâché. The
                research on the historical meaning and uses of <em>carton</em>
                in this essay, and its examination of references to
                <em>carton</em> in both Ms. Fr. 640 and contemporaneous French
                literature demonstrates that, while many uses of <em>carton</em>
                were similar to those of papier-mâché, <em>carton</em> was also
                employed in ways not associated with papier-mâché. By examining
                the multiple functions of <em>carton</em>—as a cheaper mold
                substitute, or as an element in composite decorative objects,
                for example—this essay sheds light on the capacious
                understanding of the material in early modern Europe.</p>

    <p>At first glance, the entry “<em>Carton</em>” on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/81r/f/81r/tl"><u>81r</u></a>
        of BnF. Ms. Fr. 640 might seem to be about the material we now know as
        papier-mâché.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>
            <strong>Carton</strong>
        </p>
        <p>One ought to take paper from Florence, which is the finest, &amp;
            pestle it &amp; soak it several times &amp; change the water every
            day, so that it does not smell bad, &amp; when you have molded it in
            the hollow form, put a linen over it, &amp; from the back, rub the
            back of the paper with a tooth, as if you wanted to burnish it, and
            it will mold very neatly. Then glue the cloth on the back with
            strong glue (fol. <a
               href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/81r/f/81r/tl"><u>81r</u></a>).

    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>Although extant remnants of papier-mâché
        sculptures, dolls, mirror frames, and ceiling ornaments dating from
        between the fifteenth and seventeenth centuries show its wide use in
        early modern Europe, it is difficult to ascertain to what end the
        author-practitioner intended to use his <em>carton</em>. This question
        is not illuminated by the reconstruction process because important
        details are missing from this entry, including the tools needed, as well
        as any description of the final product. Since the term “papier-mâché”
        only came into use in the late seventeenth century, this essay focuses
        historical research on the term <em>carton</em>. Two forms of analysis
        are conducted. The first starts from the author-practitioner’s use of
        the term <em>carton</em> in seven entries in the manuscript, and the
        second examines the term in wider contemporaneous French literature,
        including novels and correspondence. This analysis shows that in early
        modern Europe, the concept of <em>carton</em> was not limited to what
        later became known as papier-mâché, but also included uses as a cheaper
        mold alternative and as an element in larger, composite decorative
        objects such as tables.</p>
    <h2 id="materials-and-reconstruction-of-carton">Materials and Reconstruction
        of <em>Carton</em></h2>
    <p>The entry on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/81r/f/81r/tl"><u>81r</u></a>
        starts by specifying that paper from Florence is to be used for making
        <em>carton</em>, presumably because it is “the finest” (<em>le plus
            fin</em>). This immediately raises the question: what is meant by
        the “finest”? Does he mean the degree to which the rags were beaten to
        pulp in the initial paper-making process? An entry on “Paper” on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/12r/f/12r/tl"><u>12r</u></a>
        also mentions that the “whitest &amp; finest is the best” kind of paper.
        An emphasis on color and tactile quality are found in an
        eighteenth-century French language source, published as part of a series
        of texts describing arts and trades by the Académie royale des sciences
        in 1762. Joseph Jérôme Lefrançais de Lalande explains in <em>Art du
            cartonnier</em> that although scraps of paper could be collected
        from fan-makers and paper-makers, the <em>cartonniers</em> would
        separate the paper scraps, reserving the finest and whitest to make
        delicate white <em>carton</em>.<a href="#fn1"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref1"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> Later, in discussing the multiple
        uses of <em>carton,</em> Lalande again emphasizes that</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>anyone can imitate the work of the <em>cartonnier</em> at a small
            scale and make himself a substance of the same nature as that of
            <em>carton</em>, nice and suitable for different kinds of works. He
            who wants only a small quantity of <em>carton</em>, nice and white,
            to make bas-reliefs, figures pressed in hollows or plaster molds,
            medals, etc., only needs to soak for a while some scraps of nice
            paper, grind them in a mortar until they are like gruel or a very
            fine cream; one applies a small quantity of this substance in a
            lightly oiled mold, so that the <em>carton</em> does not stick to
            it; one lets it dry or at least consolidate itself in the mold, and
            one obtains an exact impression.<a href="#fn2"
               class="footnote-ref"
               id="fnref2"
               role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>Lalande notes that there is “considerable
        commerce in such works,” thereby hinting at widespread use of
        <em>carton</em> to make such objects.<a href="#fn3"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref3"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> Since his book primarily focuses
        on <em>carton</em> production on a large workshop scale, it is possible
        that his mention of white <em>carton</em> is linked to smaller objects
        created with fine paper.</p>
    <p>In another contemporaneous source, albeit farther away in England, Helen
        Smith found that the “finest papers were beautifully smooth.”<a
           href="#fn4"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref4"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> She finds evidence for the
        desirability of smooth paper in Edward Topsell’s <em>Historie of
            four-footed beasts</em> (1607), in which he wrote, “of the teeth of
        Oxen I know no other vse but scraping and making Paper smooth.” <a

           role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> The emphasis on fine paper is a
        justifiable concern when one takes into consideration the rags that were
        used in making early modern paper. Albert Proteaux, in his
        book&nbsp;<em>Practical Guide for the Manufacture of Paper and
            Boards</em> (1866), dates the beginning of preparing paper from rags
        to second half of the twelfth century.<a href="#fn6"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref6"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> This is substantiated by findings
        from Thomas Collings and Derek Milner’s microscopic analysis of paper
        specimens manufactured between 1400 and 1800 in Europe. Collings and
        Milner found the specimens showed a mixture of hemp and flax fiber.<a

           id="fnref7"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> Similar results were found from

           id="fnref8"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> Unless these rags were properly
        soaked and crushed, the paper could have a rough texture.</p>
    <p>Once the finest paper from Florence is sourced, the author-practitioner’s
        next step is to “pestle it &amp; soak it several times &amp; change the
        water every day, so that it does not smell bad.” Although the
        author-practitioner does not mention the particularities of the water,
        clean water is generally considered an important aspect of papermaking
        and is often emphasized by paper mills.<a href="#fn9"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref9"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> In a 1976 documentary on a paper
        mill making handmade paper from cotton, the narrator notes a chemical
        reaction between water and cotton, which forms a natural bond that holds
        the pulp together.<a href="#fn10"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref10"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
    <p>My reconstruction of the crushing and soaking steps led to two important
        observations: the first pertained to the water’s role in cleaning the
        pulp. Having crushed and ground dry paper in a mortar and pestle as best
        I could, I soaked it in water and left it for a day.<a href="#fn11"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref11"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> I then scooped out the soaked
        paper scraps and drained the water. I noticed that there were paper
        particles that did not stick with the larger lump and these were drained
        along with the water. I then crushed the leftover pulp and added new
        water. This cleaning procedure was conducted three times. I noticed that
        each time the water was drained, it became clearer (<i><u>Fig. 1</u></i>
        and <i><u>Fig. 2</u></i>). A comparison between these two images shows
        that the water in which the pulp is soaked looks significantly different
        after the first and the second washes.</p>

    <p>Second, I observed that the repetition of this process was not only for
        the sake of cleaning the pulp. While changing the water over a period of
        three days, I also conducted three rounds of “crushing.” The combination
        of extended crushing and soaking improved the smoothness of the pulp (<i><u>Fig. 3</u></i> and <i><u>Fig. 4</u></i>). I realized that even
        though the author-practitioner did not specify the consistency required
        of crushed paper, his process of soaking it in new water not only
        prevented the paper from smelling bad, it also seemed to help dissolve
        the bonds between the fibers of the soaked paper, thereby creating a
        pulp of “fine” quality.</p>

    <p>Once the paper is crushed and cleaned, the entry details how this
        finely-crushed pulp can be molded. Although the author-practitioner does
        not specify what kind of mold to use for this particular recipe, on fol.

           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/12v/f/12v/tl"><u>12v</u></a>
        in “Molding stucco promptly,” the author-practitioner gives instructions
        on making a mold out of ground brick and melted wax. He writes that this
        type of mold is suitable for casting “pestled paper.” It cannot be
        ascertained whether he would have used such a mold for the process on
        fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/81r/f/81r/tl"><u>81r</u></a>,
        as he simply notes there a hollow form. Studies on extant papier-mâché
        sculptures speculate about the use of plaster molds.<a href="#fn12"

        mold (<i><u>Fig. 5</u></i>) and a non-stick bundt pan (<i><u>Fig. 6</u></i>). In the next step, the author-practitioner advises putting a linen
        cloth over the pulp in this molded cavity and then rubbing it with a
        tooth. This process is reminiscent of burnishing, and its purpose is
        described as leading to a “very neat mold.” I chose Blick Belgian
        unbleached linen available in the Making and Knowing lab. Instead of a
        tooth, I used an agate burnisher (<i><u>Fig. 7</u></i>).</p>

                excess water. As pressure is applied from the burnisher, the
                pulp releases water which, in turn, is soaked up by the linen.
                This is similar to the use of a sponge in Filippo Baldinucci’s
                recipe for <em>cartapesta</em>. © Making and Knowing Project (<a

    <p>Although the rationale the author-practitioner provides for using the
        “tooth” was to create a “neat mold,” I noticed that “burnishing” the
        linen created pressure, causing excess water from the pulp to be
        released and soaked up by the linen (<i><u>Fig. 8</u></i>). This
        function of burnishing recalls a step in a seventeenth-century
        <em>cartapesta</em> (papier-mâché) recipe recorded by Filippo Baldinucci
        (1624–1697) in <em>Vocabolario toscano dell'Arte del disegno</em>
        (1681).<a href="#fn13"

        remove the excess water from the pulp in the mold. Baldinucci’s recipe
        is considered one of the first technical explanations of
        <em>cartapesta</em> and is much more detailed than that of the
        author-practitioner. However, my reconstruction shows that, although the
        author-practitioner’s rationale for burnishing was to create a “neat
        mold,” this instruction has the added effect of removing excess water.
        Only the act of following his procedure makes this manifest.</p>

    <p>The final step requires applying glue to the linen to adhere it to the

        their fragility.<a href="#fn14"

    <p>My reconstruction led me to two conflicting insights. On the one hand,
        this entry lacks much essential information, particularly concerning the
        tools required to make <em>carton</em>. There is mention of neither the
        implement with which to crush the paper (I used a mortar and pestle, as
        suggested by Baldinucci) nor the kind of mold to use (I tried both a
        wooden and metal mold). Either the author-practitioner assumes his
        reader knows the appropriate tools and will have them at hand, or he
        does not see such specificity as important for carrying out the process.
        On the other hand, this missing information is seemingly at odds with
        another feature of the entry: a consistent focus on the quality of
        materials and results. This focus begins with the author-practitioner’s
        call for Florentine paper. That he specifies Florentine paper appears to
        be significant, as France also produced paper by the late sixteenth
        century. This is evidenced by Richard Tottell’s 1585 complaint, when he
        attempted to establish a paper mill in England, that French paper
        merchants were buying all the rags and selling their paper at a loss.<a
           href="#fn16"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref16"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> The call for “fine paper” from
        Florence thus marks a first emphasis on quality. Second, the water
        should be changed daily to prevent it from smelling bad, which
        presumably could indicate putrefaction. Third, the author-practitioner
        writes that rubbing the linen with a burnishing tool should allow it to
        mold “very neatly.” Lastly, he specifies using “strong” glue to support
        the mold when it is taken from the cavity. Taken together, these words
        such as “strong,” “neat,” and “fine” all show that he is concerned with
        controlling the <em>carton</em>’s capacity to mold cleanly and finely.
        To what end did the author-practitioner require such a high-quality
        <em>carton</em>?</p>
    <h2 id="uses-of-molded-paper-in-early-modern-europe">Uses of Molded Paper in
        Early Modern Europe</h2>
    <p>Early modern molded paper is most widely preserved and studied today as a
        sculptural medium. From the fifteenth century onward, Italy appears to
        have been an important center for molded paper sculpture, and some of
        the leading workshops, including those of Donatello (ca. 1386–1466),
        Verrocchio (1435–1488), Sansovino (1486–1570), and Pietro Tacca
        (1577–1640), produced works in this comparatively humble medium. In the
        secondary literature, molded paper is uniformly called papier-mâché in
        English and French, or <em>cartapesta</em> in Italian, terms which the
        author-practitioner does not use. Art historians have speculated that in
        the face of a growing market for art objects and sculptures,
        papier-mâché could replace more expensive materials such as marble.<a
           href="#fn17"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref17"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> Moreover, molded
        <em>cartapesta</em> sculptures could be produced serially and with
        relative economy; the molded paper and stucco <em>Madonna and Child</em>
        in Washington D.C.’s National Gallery, made in 1550 by sculptor Jacopo
        Sansovino, is one of numerous examples from the artist’s workshop.<a
           href="#fn18"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref18"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> The use of papier-mâché in
        high-quality, complex works by celebrated sculptors militates against
        assumptions that the medium was used merely for minor or simple
        sculpture. Therefore, the use of <em>carton</em> in Ms. Fr. 640 cannot
        simply be taken as an indication of the author-practitioner’s interest
        in cheaper materials, whether for their own sake or for their ability to
        imitate more expensive ones.</p>
    <p>Two factors recommend caution in concluding that the author-practitioner
        intended his molded paper for sculptural projects like those made in
        Italian workshops. First, extant pieces of <em>cartapesta</em> sculpture
        reveal that many of them are quite large and require additional support.
        A recent restoration of one example of a serially-produced crucifix by
        Pietro Tacca shows that the sculpture was cast in parts and is entirely
        supported by an internal wire armature.<a href="#fn19"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref19"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a> Similarly, Sansovino’s 120 x 98
        cm <em>Madonna and Child</em> was mounted on a wooden support after
        being molded. The author-practitioner, by contrast, only describes a
        simple molding process with no mention of additional support beyond a
        mere canvas backing. Therefore, we might conclude the recipe was
        intended for smaller-scale objects. Second, some studies of
        <em>cartapesta</em> sculpture emphasize that glue was mixed with the
        pulp.<a href="#fn20"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref20"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> Although the author-practitioner
        uses glue (<em>colle forte</em>), it is only to adhere the molded pulp
        to the linen. He does not incorporate it into the pulp mixture itself,
        and this raises questions about whether he intended to make larger-scale
        sculptures like those of his Italian contemporaries. It is worth noting
        here that Lalande’s <em>Art du cartonnier</em> also notes that crushing
        sized paper (i.e., paper with glue or “size” applied) to make
        <em>carton</em> for molding is advantageous because its glue would later
        help to give body to the paste.<a href="#fn21"

    <p>English-language primary sources and scholarship on papier-mâché also
        show its wide use in architectural ornaments, especially from the

        alternatives.<a href="#fn23"

        techniques, mentions several uses of paper. Of greatest relevance, in
        chapter 142, “The Art of Molding and Casting,” in a subsection entitled
        “special uses of this art,” Plat notes that one “may cast many rare and
        excellent patterns... with the pap of common paper, being well wrought
        and laboured by a workman.”<a href="#fn25"

    <p>Given the smaller dimensions and relatively simpler structures of
        architectural molding, it is possible that the author-practitioner might
        have aimed to use his <em>carton</em> to make such pieces. The linen
        support he recommends could be used to make the ornament more stable as
        it was embedded in or hung on different surfaces.</p>
    <p>Most research on molded paper and papier-mâché architectural decoration
        is based on English sources and examples, so how did French sources use
        the word “papier-mâché” and “<em>carton</em>”? A search in ArtFl
        Frantext, a database of French texts, shows that in the eighteenth
        century, papier-mâché was specifically used in reference to figurines.<a

           role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a> The first use of the term in the

            la première fois</em> (1736) by Pierre Carlet de Chamblain de

            then. The reason is this: that you have had troubles; but what fine

    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>By referring to a thin physical appearance
        as resembling papier-mâché, this passage suggests three things. First,
        that papier-mâché was common enough by 1736 to make it a recognizable
        point of reference. Second, it appears that papier-mâché could refer to
        sculptural or other designs made in the shape of human figures. Third,
        papier-mâché was known for its light color, thus making it a metaphoric
        stand-in for individuals of pale complexion. Other literary sources
        support this latter use. For instance, in 1784, Jacques-Henri Bernandin
        De Saint-Pierre’s (1737–1814) <em>Études De La Nature</em> (Studies of
        Nature) contains the passage<em>,</em></p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Children compelled to such regimes as those of most of our doctors
            and apothecaries all have a face like papier-mâché, and when they
            grow up, they have their fathers’ pale complexions and ill-humoured
            temperaments.<a href="#fn30"

    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>Here again, papier-mâché is associated
        with the appearance of those who are thin and sickly. By the late
        nineteenth century, “to have a papier mâché face” (“<em>avoir une figure
            de papier mâché</em>”) had become an idiom.<a href="#fn31"
           class="footnote-ref"

           role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a> These two instances show that
        early uses of papier-mâché, at least in literature, related mainly to
        its specific shape as figurines/dolls and that paleness was an important
        feature of papier-mâché’s characterization.</p>
    <p>These literary insights are interesting, however, the earliest instances
        of the word “papier-mâché” date from the late seventeenth century.<a

        Cotgrave’s 1611 <em>Dictionarie of the French and English Tongues,</em>

        Up until now, this essay has followed other secondary sources in
        equating “papier-mâché” with the author-practitioner’s
        “<em>carton</em>.” Our definition today of papier-mâché as
        “three-dimensional objects composed of paper fiber, whether layered up

        author-practitioner’s process for making <em>carton</em>, which involves
        paper beaten into a pulp and then molded. Despite this overlap, the term
        <em>carton</em> must also be situated within the author-practitioner’s
        temporal and geographical context of late sixteenth-century France.</p>
    <h2 id="whats-in-a-word-etymology-and-terminology">What’s in a Word?
        Etymology and Terminology</h2>
    <p>Cotgrave’s translation of the French term <em>carton</em> provides the
        following description: “thicke paper on where painters draw sometimes
        and that whereof some fannes are made, also a square piece thereof
        pastboard; (also a carter, or carre-man).”<a href="#fn34"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref34"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a> Both the entry on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/81r/f/81r/tl"><u>81r</u></a>
        and Cotgrave’s definition imply that thickness of paper is an important
        feature of <em>carton</em>. Yet Cotgrave emphasizes a certain solidity
        or rigidity (“thicke paper” on which painters could draw) absent from
        the author-practitioner’s entries. So, although fol. 81r explains that
        <em>carton</em> is formed by molding the pulp in a hollow form, it is
        possible that the use of the term <em>carton</em> carries a more
        expansive definition than implied by the more recent term
        “papier-mâché.” In other words, we must ask: how was the term
        <em>carton</em> understood by the author-practitioner? In the following
        section I address this question in two ways: first I analyze the
        author-practitioner’s use of the word <em>carton</em> in six other
        entries in the manuscript, and second, I examine its use in wider
        contemporaneous French literature.</p>

    <h2 id="writing-and-painting-surface">Writing and Painting Surface</h2>
    <p>A comparison of these six entries from Ms. Fr. 640 shows the multiple
        uses of <em>carton</em>. The first use of <em>carton</em> is consistent
        with Cotgrave’s definition, i.e., as a thick paper surface on which to
        write, draw, or paint. This is evident in three entries: fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/57v/f/57v/tl"><u>57v</u></a>
        “Painter,” fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/68r/f/68r/tl"><u>68r</u></a>
        “Fanciful tables,” and fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/142v/f/142v/tl"><u>142v</u></a>
        “Molding grasshoppers and things too thin.” The use of <em>carton</em>
        as a painting surface finds resonance in a 1689 play <em>L'intrigue des
            filous</em> by French playwright and poet Claude de L’Estoile
        (1602-1652),</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Must you rail so against your fortune,</p>
        <p>For a little <em>carton</em> smeared with paint?</p>
        <p>Or perhaps Florinde is ugly in crimson?<a href="#fn35"

    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>In spite of its mocking tone, this passage
        supports the conclusion gleaned from fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/81r/f/81r/tl"><u>81r</u></a>—that
        <em>carton</em> was used as a surface to draw or paint on, likely due to
        its thickness, rigidity, and perhaps even portability. Further, on fol.
        <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/57v/f/57v/tl"><u>57v</u></a>,
        the language of “images made of <em>carton</em>” that could be coated
        with resin to resist wet weather implies that <em>carton</em> was
        portable and could be taken or used outside. This suggests that
        <em>carton</em> could be an appropriate support for painted images used
        for outdoor public festivals or royal entries, for instance.</p>
    <h2 id="a-composite-material-in-furniture">A Composite Material in Furniture
    </h2>
    <p>While functioning as a painting surface, the <em>carton</em> in the entry
        on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/68r/f/68r/tl"><u>68r</u></a>,
        “Fanciful tables,” is also part of a larger decorative object.
        Interestingly, Louis le Comte&nbsp;(1655–1728), a&nbsp;Jesuit&nbsp;who
        went to China, included a letter in <em>Nouveaux mémoires sur l'état
            présent de la Chine</em> (1696) that shows the use of
        <em>carton</em> in making Chinese lacquer tables: a</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>For tables and ordinary chairs, one is content with applying two or
            three coats of varnish, which leaves it so transparent that one can
            see the grain of the wood through it... But those who wish to make
            something finished paste onto the wood a kind of <em>carton</em>
            made of paper, flax, chalk, and some other well-beaten materials, in
            which the varnish incorporates itself. With this they make a
            perfectly uniform and solid ground, on which the varnish is applied
            little by little in thin coats, which one leaves to dry one after
            the other.<a href="#fn36"
               class="footnote-ref"
               id="fnref36"

    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>In this passage, Le Comte describes
        <em>carton</em> made from paper beaten together with flax, chalk and
        other unspecified materials, which is then applied to the structure.
        Finally, varnish layers are added on top. As in “Fanciful Tables on fol.
        68r, <em>carton</em> is incorporated into a seemingly more durable
        object made from other materials such as wood.</p>

        all show <em>carton</em> used as a cheaper supplementary workshop
        material in molding. Although <em>carton</em> is not part of the final
        product in these entries, it is used as part of an intermediary step in
        the making process.<a href="#fn37"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref37"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>37</sup></a> For instance, in the entry
        “Founders of small works of tin,” <em>carton</em> is used to take
        imprints from stone reliefs, whereas in “Excellent sand for lead, tin,
        and copper,” a temporary <em>carton</em> mixture ensures that cast
        objects fit well within the mold, and in “Molding grasshoppers and
        things too thin,” the raised letters painted onto the <em>carton</em>
        form a relief from which an impression can be taken.</p>
    <h2 id="material-affordances">Material Affordances</h2>
    <p>While these entries show the varied uses of <em>carton</em>, they also
        illustrate the author-practitioner’s familiarity with both the
        constraints and affordances of the material. First, he is aware that
        paper interacts with the surrounding environment through humidity and
        moisture. This raises for him concerns of durability and conservation.
        On fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/57v/f/57v/tl"><u>57v</u></a>,
        in the entry “Painter,” he specifically cautions that if images on
        <em>carton</em> are not soaked in resin, the <em>carton</em> will turn
        limp in wet weather. Since <em>carton</em> is made by manipulating
        paper’s ability to absorb water, the author-practitioner is sensitive to
        the effect that humidity and dryness can have on the shape and integrity
        of the image painted on <em>carton</em>. Similarly, on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/142v/f/142v/tl"><u>142v</u></a>
        “Molding grasshoppers and things too thin,” he writes that moisture of
        sand and clay plate will undo glue writings on <em>carton</em>, again
        bringing attention to the impact of moisture on the material. This
        understanding of how <em>carton</em>’s shape is affected by the moisture
        of both the external environment and adjacent materials in larger making
        processes leads the author-practitioner to suggest alternative materials
        to mitigate the impact. For example, instead of using glue to write on
        <em>carton</em>, he recommends cinnabar mixed with oil in a marginal
        note on 142v. This recalls Tim Ingold’s statement that “when human
        beings make things, they work within a world rather than acting upon a
        material world from outside.”<a href="#fn38"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref38"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
    <p>If <em>carton</em>’s vulnerability to moisture can be understood as a
        constraining factor that concerned the author-practitioner,
        <em>carton</em>’s versatility in its paste form shows why it was used as
        a supporting material in his other entries. I refer to the
        author-practitioner’s concern to control the thickness of
        <em>carton</em>—a kind of manipulation the material specifically
        affords. In “Founders of small works of tin” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/80v/f/80v/tl"><u>80v</u></a>),
        he specifies that <em>carton</em> as “thick as one finger” can be used
        to take impressions of stone reliefs. In “Excellent sand for lead, tin,
        and copper ” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/87v/f/87v/tl"><u>87v</u></a>),
        when he cautions to ensure that cast objects line up directly with their
        molds, he suggests using <em>carton</em> to adjust for any discrepancy.
        He advises experimenting on the depth of the mold first with
        <em>carton</em>, and he ultimately writes, “of whatever thickness you
        please.” These instances show the degree of flexibility and versatility
        that <em>carton</em> could provide. In other words, <em>carton</em>’s
        ability to be formed into varying thicknesses <em>and</em> its
        malleability makes it a useful and versatile workshop material.
        Therefore, while <em>carton</em>’s vulnerability to water damage limits
        its use, the flexibility it allows in terms of thickness, malleability,
        and versatility makes it an important part of the processes of artisanal
        making.</p>
    <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>This essay initially sought to understand how the author-practitioner
        intended to use his <em>carton</em> recipe on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/81r/f/81r/tl"><u>81r</u></a>.
        Due to the striking similarity between his description of
        <em>carton</em> and our understanding of papier-mâché, it was assumed
        that these were synonymous. After conducting a reconstruction and a
        literature review centered on papier-mâché and its uses, a more
        interesting question emerged. What did the word <em>carton</em> mean to
        the author-practitioner? Was there more to this word than our initial
        translation of it as “papier-mâché” implied, especially given that the
        latter term only emerged in the late seventeenth century? By studying
        the author-practitioner’s own use of the term <em>carton</em> as well as
        its use in contemporaneous French writings, this essay shows that the
        word <em>carton</em> could designate molded so-called papier-mâché
        objects, but the definition of <em>carton</em> was clearly more
        expansive than this. It designated a versatile, paper-based material
        with uses in casting, furniture making, painting, and draftsmanship,
        among others. Thus, the author-practitioner’s description and use of
        <em>carton</em> shows his experience of paper’s material properties, and
        alerts us to a broader understanding of the term, one that is not always
        conveyed by historians’ use of the later term “papier-mâché.”</p>

                <p>Vannoccio Biringuccio gives a purportedly first-hand
                    description of Giambattista Pelori’s method for making
                    reproductive molds for sculptures: the process begins by
                    coating the sculpture to be reproduced in mashed paper,
                    “just as masks are made.” This initial layer is then coated
                    with several layers of a paste composed of flour and hide
                    scrapings, then the whole is covered with linen scraps.
                    After drying, this layer, it is cut off the statue, forming
                    a mold form. This mold is rendered impermeable with Grecian
                    pitch and wax, and is then ready for plaster to be poured
                    into it to create multiple reproductions. Biringuccio notes
                    that “these moulds were made with little expense; they were
                    strong and unbreakable, light and easily carried to suitable
                    places; surely in my opinion, he had a fine discovery.”
