                specifies mixing gold leaf with materials for making glass and
                heating to a temperature higher than for any other (imitation)
                gemstone. The author-practitioner failed at making ruby, as did
                most seekers of “gold ruby” glass, including multiple cohorts of
                Making and Knowing participants who reconstructed the process
                detailed in Ms. Fr. 640. This essay considers the crucial role
                of “imitation” and “failure” in stimulating the investigation of
                and experimentation on natural materials and processes.</p>

    <p>The recipe to make “ruby” on fols. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/100v/f/100v/tl"><u>100v</u></a>–<a

        is one of several in Ms. Fr. 640 for making imitation gemstones. The
        author-practitioner’s interest in imitating precious and semi-precious
        stones such as rubies, emeralds, topaz, jacinth, diamonds, jasper,
        coral, among other stones, underscores that mimesis—and more
        specifically, material mimesis—was not just the aesthetic goal of
        artisans in representing nature in general, but more significantly, it
        was a mode of work by which processes of nature were explored and
        harnessed to produce new, more workable and useful materials.<a

    <p>Rubies are first mentioned in Ms. Fr. 640 on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/8v/f/8v/tl"><u>8v</u></a>
        in a brief explanation of how to polish a balas ruby (<em>polissement du
            ruby balay</em>).<a href="#fn2"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref2"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> The treatment of the ruby on fol.
        8v concerns a genuine balas ruby, a semiprecious stone ranging in color
        from deep crimson or purple to pale rose, now classified as a kind of
        spinel. The only other instance of ruby in the manuscript is that on
        fols. 100v-101r.</p>
    <p>Vannoccio Biringuccio, the author of the 1540 text on metalworking,
        <em>De la pirotechnia</em>, describes the ruby as native to Libya and
        India; a lustrous transparent stone, whose color is “full red, dry, and
        not unctuous, but very brilliant.” He regards it as a stone not quite as
        hard as a diamond and notes that “speculative physicians, judging by its
        color, say that its nature is hot.”<a href="#fn3"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref3"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> Such an understanding of the ruby
        presumably helped to inform the author-practitioner’s aim in his entry
        for making ruby on fols. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/100v/f/100v/tl"><u>100v</u></a>–<a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/101r/f/101r/tl"><u>101r</u></a>.
        The recipe for making ruby is part of an unusually cohesive set of nine
        recipes on glass and stone making processes (fols. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/100r/f/100r/tl"><u>100r</u></a>–<a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/101v/f/101v/tl"><u>101v</u></a>),
        and, like the other recipes in this set, the author-practitioner seems
        to regard it as a glass process, but his title for these recipes is
        “<em>pierrerie</em>,” meaning not “imitation gemstones,” but simply
        “gemstones.” We discuss how the author-practitioner might have
        understood these glass making procedures in relation to genuine
        gemstones in our essay on “Gemstones and Imitation.”<a href="#fn4"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref4"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
    <h2 id="failure">Failure</h2>
    <p>The author-practitioner failed to make a ruby, as did we in our
        reconstructions, for reasons of historical and practical interest. This
        essay examines both the author-practitioner’s aspiration to make a
        colored glass ruby by using gold, and his failure to do so, in the
        context of a very long history of failure and experimentation stimulated
        by a millennia-long search for imitation ruby.</p>
    <p>Like most other entries in the manuscript, the author-practitioner’s
        account leaves out much that would be useful to a historian: where did
        he obtain real rubies? How convincing did he expect these glass
        gemstones to be? For what purpose were they used? Were they intended for
        sale, and if so, in what markets? Was their status as glass gems openly
        acknowledged? On the other hand, as explained in our other essays on
        gemstones in this edition, the entries on <em>Pierrerie</em> are
        relatively clearly written, and contain—for Ms. Fr. 640—quite detailed
        information on ingredients, equipment, and process. The nine entries are
        evidently informed by sequential experimentation, and thus form an
        unusually coherent set of recipes in Ms. Fr. 640.<a href="#fn5"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref5"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> Moreover, the entry on ruby is
        written in the format of an already well-established recipe genre, which
        typically contains the imperative <em>Recipe</em> (abbreviated as Rx) or
        “Take”: “For ruby take some gold leaf (<em>Pour ruby prens de lor en
            foeille</em>)” (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/100v/f/100v/tl"><u>100v</u></a>).
        The author-practitioner thereby immediately establishes a relationship
        between these two precious materials, ruby and gold, intimating that
        from gold something approximating a ruby can be made. The gold to be
        used is identified as the “gold leaf of what the painters gild,” but
        this is qualified in a marginal note: “Others say that it is necessary
        that the gold be cemented several times, then beaten into leaf.”<a
           href="#fn6"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref6"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
    <p>The recipe specifies to “take some gold leaf,” then abruptly returns to a
        discussion of furnace construction started in the recipe for
        <em>pierrerie</em> just above it, on which the ruby process builds:
        “Raise your furnace by two tiles all around, because one needs more heat
        for making rubies than for emeralds” (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/100v/f/100v/tl"><u>100v</u></a>).
        Like the furnace illustrated on fol. 100v, the author-practitioner
        illustrates these new furnace instructions with a sketch in the left
        margin of fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/101r/f/101r/tl"><u>101r</u></a>
        that shows tiles propped up against one another, captioned as if
        speaking to the reader: “If you need greater heat, put, on the edge of
        the opening of the glowing furnace, tiles, one against the other, for
        making the heat reverberate” (<i><u>Fig. 1</u></i>). It is not so
        unusual in the gemstone recipes that the author-practitioner returns to
        the previous recipe, for this set of nine recipes between fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/100r/f/100r/tl"><u>100r</u></a>
        and fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/101v/f/101v/tl"><u>101v</u></a>
        refer to each other constantly, in matters of ingredients—they all
        include the same basic ingredients, calcined quartz pebbles and minium
        (red lead)—and in their comparisons of heat and cooking times across the
        recipes. This method of cross-referencing between different gemstone
        recipes is apparently not uncommon among other contemporary
        compilations, whereby the reader is instructed “it is made, like
        rubies,” or “proceed as if for ruby.”<a href="#fn7"

                another, advising that “if you need greater heat, put, on the

    <p>In our reconstruction (which necessitated multiple substitutions), rather
        than raising “our furnace by two tiles,” we removed the top of our
        furnace, constructed of three firebricks, to bring the crucible into
        more direct heat and to reduce the size of the firing chamber.<a
           href="#fn8"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref8"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> The recipe then instructs the
        reader to cover the crucible “with an appropriate tile, a bit thick, in
        order that heat reverberates better there,” then specifies further
        furnace conditions: “fill your furnace to the opening with charcoal, so
        that it will be heaped, and let it kindle, and always maintain the heat
        evenly without letting the charcoal decrease. And for this effect,
        always make it so that the furnace is heaped &amp; full of charcoal, and
        maintain it thus for one day.”<a href="#fn9"
           class="footnote-ref"

        a full day, but we did cover the top of the furnace in order to increase
        the temperature. We left the crucible itself uncovered in the furnace to
        better observe changes while heating the mixture for a period of about
        five minutes, which was long enough to more or less melt the contents of
        calcined quartz (“white calcined pebbles”) and minium in a 1:3 ratio,
        ground together with a small amount of gold leaf (<i><u>Fig. 2</u></i>).<a href="#fn10"

    <p>The author-practitioner succinctly records his experience at this point:
        “The first experience that I made of it, it only returned a yellow mass,
        as is vitrified minium alone, &amp; some grains of gold in a mass at the
        bottom” (fol. <a

        This precisely matches our first (and only attempt) at making ruby. Like
        the author-practitioner, we were left with gold pieces suspended in a
        slightly yellowed substance enclosed in a layer of glass at the bottom
        of the crucible (<i><u>Fig. 3</u></i>).</p>

    <p>A year after this first failure, the Making and Knowing Project
        collaborated with the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD) Glass
        Department to reconstruct the process for making ruby with the goal of
        approximating more faithfully the original conditions, with regard to
        the furnace, charcoal, and a full day’s heating (<i><u>Vid. 1</u></i>).<a href="#fn11"

    <p>The author-practitioner’s failure unleashed a torrent of reflecting,
        hypothesizing, extending, experimenting, and apparently failing again:
        He begins this intensive activity immediately after his first failure,
        recording, with emphasis, a note to himself: “<strong>Try cemented gold
            and accompanied with antimony</strong>.” Looking again more closely
        at the notes in the left margin on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/100v/f/100v/tl"><u>100v</u></a>,
        where the ruby recipe begins, it is clear that both statements are in a
        different ink, and probably were added after his first failed
        experience: “Some say that, mixing the gold with the pebbles and the
        saltpeter, it makes the color of a peach tree,” and “Others say that it
        is necessary that the gold be cemented several times, then beaten into
        leaf” (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/100v/f/100v/tl"><u>100v</u></a>).
        Moreover, his directive to “Raise your furnace by two tiles all around,
        because one needs more heat for making rubies than for emeralds” seems
        also to have been added later. After collecting the experience of others
        and recording his own, the author-practitioner then seems to have turned
        to experiment with creating other gemstones, first topaz, then jacinth
        (a reddish-orange gem variety of zircon).<a href="#fn12"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref12"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> During both these processes, he
        is thinking about his ruby failure, coming back repeatedly to ruby, for
        example, in noting his success with topaz, which furnished him with
        further information on the ruby process: “The ruby <em>
            <del>en</del>
        </em> wants more time &amp; more fire &amp; colored with gold leaf. I
        believe that pumice stone or firestone for the ruby would be better”
        (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/101r/f/101r/tl"><u>101r</u></a>).
        And, in the jacinth recipe (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/101v/f/101v/tl"><u>101v</u></a>),
        he seems only to be thinking about ruby:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Jacinth</p>
        <p>Is made like ruby, with gold, but one does not need such a great
            fire. The ruby wants fire for a whole day, and if it does not have
            enough fire, it will only have red veins.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>He adds in the margin that “one holds that
        rubified antimony makes jacinth,” in a hypothesis similar to that which
        had produced his note to himself to try antimony and cemented gold as a
        colorant for ruby. And he adds, for the second time in as many folios,
        that crucibles must be reheated before putting them into the furnace.
    </p>
    <p>These accounts seem to indicate that the author-practitioner attempted
        and failed to make ruby more than once, although he succeeded with topaz
        and apparently also with jacinth. His experimentation after the first
        failure also shows that he hypothesized that some other form of gold may
        have been needed (perhaps combined with antimony), and, additionally,
        and more insistently, that ruby demands a high heat, maintained over
        many hours (“one day”).<a href="#fn13"

    <h2 id="red-and-gold">Red and Gold</h2>
    <p>The author-practitioner clearly believes that gold is necessary to create
        red color. This association between gold and red was the core of a
        material imaginary that informed humoral therapies, alchemical theory
        and practice, and a variety of metalworking and pigment making
        techniques. In medical theory, the most well-balanced temperament was
        that of the humor of blood—the sanguine—and it could be stimulated by
        ingesting potable gold or even by wearing gold on the body. In alchemy,
        the philosophers’ stone was usually described as a red substance, which,
        when projected over a metal mass could transmute it into gold. Many
        metal and pigment recipes call for red substances to produce gold
        colored pigments and metals.<a href="#fn14"

    <h2 id="recipes-for-rubies">Recipes for Rubies</h2>

        making red glass.<a href="#fn15"

        ruby,” whereby the stone is heated in “gold-founder’s waste,” then
        dipped in cedar oil, mixed with “natural sulfur,” and left in the “dye,

        philosopher Johann Kunckel (1637?–1703) offered a detailed report of
        gold ruby glass made by Andreas Cassius (1605–1673), published in
        chapter 10, “De Operationibus Circa Aurum Chymicis” (Some Experiments in
        the Chymistry of Gold) in his <em>De Auro</em> (1685). According to
        Kunckel, Cassius created a purple-colored gold pigment, subsequently
        called Purple of Cassius, by mixing gold chloride and stannous chloride
        in <em>aqua regia</em> (i.e., a mixture of HCL and HNO<sub>3</sub>).<a

    <blockquote>
        <p>It began in this way. There was a Doctor of medicine called Cassius
            who discovered how to precipitate <em>Solis cum Jove</em> [gold with
            tin]; I believe that Glauber may have given him the idea, or so it
            seems to me. Dr. Cassius tried to introduce it into the glass, but
            when he tried to form glass from it or when it was taken from the
            fire, it was as clear as any other crystal and he was unable to
            achieve a stable red [....] As soon as I heard of this, I
            immediately took it up, but only I know what trouble I had to find
            the composition, to get it right and to obtain a durable red.<a

    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>Earlier in the book, Kunckel described his
        own process of making the purple precipitate:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>I take two parts of good aqua fortis and one part of spirits of salt,
            or failing this some strong salt water. When these are mixed, throw
            in from time to time a little of the purest tin so that it does not
            heat up but dissolves slowly [....] With this solution the gold can
            be precipitated in such a beautiful colour that it cannot be more
            beautiful, and thereby can crystal glass be given the finest ruby
            colour if the gold has previously been dissolved in three parts of
            <em>aqua regia</em> and one part of spirits of salt.<a href="#fn40"

        coloring glass with a gold solution, practically identical to Cassius’s
        purple pigment, not to produce vessels, as Kunckel later did, but
        because he saw a link between this process and the transmutation of
        metals. Glauber believed that metals showed their true colors only when
        melted into glass, and he hoped that by extracting these colors, he
        could reveal the secret of the philosophers’ stone.<a href="#fn43"

    <p>In the mid-seventeenth century, Glauber explicitly linked the production
        of gold ruby glass to alchemy, believing that the color of metals
        indicated their “soul” or essence which could be revealed if metal salts

        claimed that the soul of gold was captured in the red color of gold ruby
        glass and, along with other practitioners, he regarded the making of
        gold ruby glass as akin to the process of alchemical transmutation
        because the philosophers’ stone turned red before it transformed into
        gold.<a href="#fn45"

        reminding his readers that all reconstructions are undoubtedly affected
        by environmental, material, and procedural differences between the
        original recipe and the moment of reconstruction.</p>
    <p>Sixteen of the 133 chapters of Antonio Neri’s <em>L’Arte vetraria</em>
        (1612) are devoted to the making of red glass: nine offer formulas that
        produce a more violet or brown color, based on the use of manganese; six
        employ copper, traditionally incorporated as a red glass colorant in
        cathedral windows and in translucent red enamels such as <em>rouge
            clair</em> used by goldsmiths in the Middle Ages and Renaissance.<a

        seventeenth-century Italy, although doubted by the author himself, who
        concludes, “but one should experiment to find it” (<em>peró si

    <h2 id="failure-and-experience">Failure and Experience</h2>
    <p>Neri’s and Kunckel’s points about experiment and experience return us to
        the intensive hypothesizing and experimenting that the
        author-practitioner’s failure in creating a ruby brought on. The recipe
        for gold ruby glass in Ms. Fr. 640 is yet another testament to a very
        long enduring material imaginary within which gold and red existed in a
        reciprocal relationship. The ruby recipe in Ms. Fr. 640 also testifies
        to the very long history of human desire that drove a search for
        hard-to-attain transmutational processes using precious, meaning-laden
        materials. The author-practitioner thus takes his place within a very
        long cycle of seeking, trying, failing, hypothesizing, extending,
        trying, and, at least for him, ultimately failing, that, over the long
        term, demonstrates how generative failure can be in the history of
        science and technology.</p>
    <p>Metalworker and author of <em>De la pirotechnia</em>, Vannoccio
        Biringuccio noted that even if the art of alchemists was entirely
        futile—a history of failure—it was nevertheless very ingenious and
        “delightful to students of natural things,” as well as being “very
        useful to human need and convenience,” for</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>it gives birth every day to new and splendid effects such as the
            extraction of medicinal substances, colors, and perfumes, and an
            infinite number of compositions of things. It is known that many
            arts have issued solely from it; indeed, without it or its means it
            would have been impossible for them ever to have been discovered by
            man except through divine revelation.</p>
        <p>***</p>
        <p>Thus, in short, it can be said in conclusion that this art is the
            origin and foundation of many other arts, wherefore it should be
            held in reverence and practiced. But he who practices it must be
            ignorant neither of cause nor of natural effects, and not too poor
            to support the expense. Neither should he do it from avarice, but
            only in order to enjoy the fine fruits of its effects and the
            knowledge of them, and that pleasing novelty which it shows to the
            experimenter in operation.<a href="#fn54"

                    Agricola, and others, including Biringuccio in book IV,
                    chapter six of the <em>Pirotechnia</em>, entitled “The
                    Method of Cementing Gold and of Bringing It to Its Ultimate
                    Fineness.” Put briefly, argentiferous gold foil, salt, and
                    brick dust or burnt clay are mixed in a sealed container and
                    heated such that the silver reacts with the salt to form
                    silver chloride, which when removed, leaves purified gold
                    behind. Biringuccio, <em>Pirotechnia</em>, 201–202.<a

                <p>In Britain, glass furnaces had been fired by wood charcoal
                    prior to the sixteenth century, however, the overriding
                    needs of the King’s Navy and the diminishing size of few
                    remaining forests in the British Isles spurred glassmakers
                    to find alternative fuel, thereby devising a system for
                    using coal. By 1615, the burning of wood in the glass
                    industry was officially forbidden by a “Proclamation
                    touching Glass.” See James Stuart, <em>Stuart Royal
                        Proclamations</em>. Vol. 1: <em>Royal Proclamations of
                        King James I, 1603–1625</em>, ed. James F. Larkin and
                    Paul L. Hughes (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1973)

                    2013. Accessed 3 December 2015. In France, however, the
                    author-practitioner regarded wood charcoal as the only fuel.
                    He only mentions “charbon de pierre” (stone or pit coal) in
                    relation to pigment (fol. 63v).<a href="#fnref9"

                <p>Our ruby experiment necessitated multiple compromises: First,
                    we could not achieve a high enough temperature, so we opted
                    instead to try the process in the marginal note on fol.
                    100v: “Some say that, mixing the gold with the pebbles and
                    the saltpeter, it makes the color of a peach tree.” Our
                    materials thus consisted of Kremer 58620 quartz powder (in
                    place of calcined quartz pebbles), Kremer 42500 red lead
                    (minium), saltpeter (potassium nitrate), and Barnabs
                    Blattgold gold leaf (as illustrated in Fig. 3). Second, we
                    did not have sufficient gold leaf, so we reduced the
                    quantity of all ingredients by 1/5, and we decided not to
                    grind the mixture with a glass pestle on a glass surface, as
                    the manuscript advises, but rather to mix the
                    already-powdered components directly in the crucible to
                    avoid loss of material. This resulted in such a small yield
                    that we could not pour anything from the crucible. Finally,
                    we did not heat the furnace with charcoal, but rather, used
                    a Bernzomatic propane blowtorch. See safety protocols
                    outlined in our field notes, especially with regard to
                    working with lead and saltpeter (potassium nitrate), as the
                    latter can be explosive. Please consult relevant Material

                <p>The Lycurgus Cup is a late Roman <em>diatretum,</em> or cage
                    cup, carved around the fourth century CE, possibly in
                    Alexandria (on account of the fine glasswork emerging from
                    Egypt at the time). The cup is decorated on all sides with
                    figures carved in high relief illustrating the myth of the
                    Thracian king Lycurgus, who enraged the god Dionysus by
                    expelling him from his kingdom and attacking his followers.
                    The story exists in several versions, however, the chosen
                    narrative corresponds to a scene from Nonnus of Panopolis’s
                    epic (comprising forty-eight books), the
                    <em>Dionysiaca</em>, in which Lycurgus attacks Ambrosia, a
                    female follower of Dionysus. Ambrosia is transformed into a
                    vine by Mother Earth which ensnares Lycurgus while the
                    Bacchantes try to kill him. On the cup, Ambrosia lies on the
                    ground in the moment of metamorphosis such that the
                    narrative transformation mirrors the cup’s potential to
                    change color. The optical trick of this rare form of glass
                    delighted the Roman aristocracy so much that it attracted
                    the attention of emperors: the author of the fourth-century
                    <em>Historia Augusta</em> reports that the Emperor Hadrian
                    sent “a cup that changes color” to his brother-in-law as a
                    gift for his banquets. See British Museum, Lycurgus Cup, <a

                    ruby glass was made in the seventeenth century by adding
                    compounds derived from gold, such as Purple of Cassius,
                    which created what is now known as a colloidal glass,
                    wherein gold is dispersed as fine particles. In such glass
                    the metallic gold forms nanoscale particles, which, if the
                    right size and shape, are suspended in the glass and convey
                    a purple-ruby color through the absorption of light. If the
                    gold colloids, as these particles are called, are too small,
                    the glass remains colorless, if they are too big and too
                    much light is absorbed, the glass looks opaque brownish.

                <p>Although unsuccessful in realizing the philosophers’ stone,
                    Glauber’s experiments yielded the qualitative analysis of
                    metal ores (because each metal produces its own distinct
                    color in glass) as Robert Boyle reported to the Royal
                    Society: “This was only by mixing some glass with the
                    mineral, and that thereby the metal predominant in the ore
                    is discovered.” Von Kerssenbrock-Krosigk, “Gold Ruby Glass,”

                <p>von Kerssenbrock-Krosigk, “Gold Ruby Glass,” 124–25. The
                    process of making red glass by the addition of copper
                    appears to have been known to the author-practitioner of Ms.
                    Fr. 640, who notes in an entry entitled “Goldsmith” on fol.
                    39r that “When goldsmiths have thus assembled their silver
                    filings with saltpeter, a red enamel vitrifies at the bottom
                    of the crucible. I do not know if the copper mixed in with
                    the silver is the cause.”<a href="#fnref51"

                <p>Dedo von Kerssenbrock-Krosigk notes that Kunckel only once,
                    in the context of one of Neri’s instructions for a copper
                    ruby glass, offers what he claims to be a better procedure:
                    “Here I wished to indicate a better way, and to briefly
                    teach [the making] of the red or ruby glass, if it were not
                    regarded as such a peculiar rarity by my gracious elector
                    and master. Whoever does not believe that I can do it may
                    come and see it. It’s true: for now it is too rare to
                    communicate.” Read in connection with a letter, written from
                    Kunckel to a friend, bragging about recent success, von
                    Kerssenbrock-Krosigk suggests that Kunckel here may have
                    deliberately chosen to brag about his success on this
                    recipe, rather than on the only gold ruby formula in the
                    book, in order to mislead potential competitors. This
                    reminds us how eagerly this recipe and its end were pursued.

                    to you to have the heat within it. Heat it once more in

                    </strong>Recipe 46 – Making ruby (<em>yaqut ahmar</em>)
                    without equal: Take one hundred dirhams of cornelian stone
                    (<em>‘aqıq</em>), two hundred dirhams of rock crystal
                    (<em>billawr</em>) and twenty five dirhams of magne- sia.
                    Heat each one alone and throw it in sour vinegar. Pound and
                    cook with sour vinegar to which <em>al-qalı</em> (alkali)
                    has been added. Cook very well for half a day until it
                    becomes dry and roasted. Throw it in cold water and wash it
                    in water and salt until its water and <em>jawhar</em> become
                    clear. Put it in a luted pot (<em>qidr</em>) with one
                    hundred dirhams of <em>natrun</em>, twenty five dirhams of
                    <em>al-qalı</em> (alkali) salt, forty dirhams of Armenian
                    borax and ten dirhams of coarse salt (<em>milh</em>
                    <em>jarısh</em>). Light up fire on it in the furnace two
                    days and two nights or one day and one night. If it melts
                    take it out when it cools and throw on it <em>iqlımiya</em>.
                    Take out the melted ingot (<em>nuqra</em>) and pulverize it
                    with sixty dirhams of red lead (<em>isrinj</em>), five
                    dirhams of cinnabar (zanjufr), two dirhams of realgar (red
                    zarnıkh) pulverised in vinegar, five dirhams of magnesia,
                    five dirhams of copper scales (rusakht), and ten dirhams of
                    pulverised blood stone which is shadanaj. Mix and put in a
                    luted pot (qidr) and place in a furnace. Blow on it
                    continuously until it melts and becomes mature. The sign of
                    its maturity is that you put out one carat (qırat) of it on
                    a clear surface until it cools. If you see it clear red with
                    plenty of water that is the water of ruby (yaqut) then it
                    has matured. If it has turbidity then blow on it until it
                    matures. [Quoted from Ahmad Y. Al-Hassan, “An Eighth Century

                    <br>
                    I have declared divers tinctures of glass, and those no
                    vulgar and common ones, but such as are rarely known, and
                    gained, and tried with a great deal of labour. Now I will
                    relate some ways of staining Crystal, and especially those
                    that are choice, and known to very few; if not onely to
                    myself.

            <p><em>To stain Crystal with the colour of a Jacinth, or a Ruby,
                    without breaking, or wearing it.</em> (p. 183)</p>
            <p>Take six parts of Stibium, four of Orpin, three of Arsenick, as
                much of Sulphur, two of Tutty; bear them all asunder, and sift
                them through a fine service: put the into a pot: hang your
                Crystal by wires, or cover it over with the powders, and so set
                it on the fire, that it may be hot, four or five hours; but use
                no bellows, lest it break in pieces or melt. It is a certain
                sign of being perfectly coloured, if you take out a piece, and
                that be of a bright and shining color; otherwise deliver it to
                the fire again, and after some time try it again. But you must
                have a great care, lest it cool too suddenly when you take it
                off the fire, for it will crumble and fall to pieces. If a
                violet colour pleaseth you, take it soon from the fire: if you
                would have a deep purple, let it stand longer: we can make a
                violet with Orpin onely.

                the lead be vitrified, and it will be of the colour of a
