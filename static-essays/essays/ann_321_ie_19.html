        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <div>
            <p>The discussion of painting in Ms. Fr. 640 forms a relatively
                small proportion of its content, but one that is significant. In
                most sixteenth-century compilations and “secrets” books,
                discussion of painting is largely limited to recipes for
                materials, often copied from elsewhere. Some, derived from
                earlier sources for manuscript illumination, describe how to
                paint particular details such as faces and hair of young people,
                or animals and birds. Ms. Fr. 640’s author-practitioner
                describes aspects of Flemish painting practice fairly
                accurately, perhaps from information received or from
                observation, and also mentions details of Italian painting
                practice, relating to painting faces. His account of materials
                treats their behavior in oil paint, rather than the list and
                description of individual pigments commonly found in other
                texts. This emphasis on practical painting in oil for a variety
                of purposes, including painting decorative metalwork and glass,
                is unusual in sources of this date, not found in such detail
                until the seventeenth century. The use of <em>cristallin</em>
                glass as a drier is described and, more interestingly, its
                additional ability to give translucency to opaque paint. The
                attention paid to the blue glass pigment smalt and its
                properties is unusual: it indicates some difficulties associated
                with its use, not discussed in other contemporary sources. Other
                blues, also green, red, yellow, white and black pigments are
                mentioned, but the author-practitioner’s particular interest is
                in translucency, which may relate to his interest in cast
                metalwork.</p>

    <p>The late sixteenth-century manuscript in the Bibliothèque nationale de
        France, catalogued as Ms. Fr. 640, contains practical notes and comments
        on a range of subjects, largely concerned with crafts. At first sight,
        painting materials and the methods for their application appear to
        occupy a rather small proportion of the content as a whole, a little
        over fourteen percent; three times as much is devoted to casting. In
        fact, the instructions and comments relating to painting, broadly
        speaking, form the second largest category in the compilation, followed
        by processes relating to metalworking and then varnish making,
        technologically related to painting, at just under five percent. Paint
        and varnish had important functions: the creation of images and all
        kinds of decorative projects, from the painting of scenery and guild
        banners to painting on glass and the ornamentation of all kinds of
        objects, from frames and hand mirrors to the cold painting of cast metal
        items, immediately come to mind. Both paint and varnish could also
        provide some protection for surfaces or objects to which they were
        applied and this was an important role. This essay compares the
        treatment of painting and painting materials by the anonymous
        “author-practitioner” of Ms. Fr. 640 with that in contemporary sources
        and then discusses some of the points raised in the manuscript itself.
        It also places these observations in the context of what is known about
        actual practice from direct examination of painted works of art from the
        relevant period.</p>
    <p>Paint consists of a colored solid powder, the pigment, mixed thoroughly
        with a liquid binding material or medium in which it is insoluble and
        which coats the particles, binding them together to create a coherent
        film that adheres to the surface being painted. The pigments used during
        the sixteenth century included ground natural minerals, such as the blue
        copper carbonate mineral azurite, and manufactured pigments, such as
        verdigris and lead white. The manufactured pigments also included lake
        pigments made from natural dyes, obtained from plants and certain
        insects, precipitated onto suitable substrates such as hydrated alumina,
        chalk, or even lead white. The binding media used included those that
        were essentially aqueous—mixed with water—such as gums, glue (made from
        animal skins and parchment scraps, for example), and egg, as well as
        oils, at this date principally linseed and walnut oils. These oils were
        also ingredients in many varnishes.<a href="#fn1"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref1"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> A varnish could itself act as a
        binding medium, or be an ingredient within an oil medium. Many of the
        effects achieved in painting are due to the physical and rheological
        (flow) properties of the binding medium used, as well as the interplay
        between the medium and the pigments used. However, it is important to
        understand that the paint is much the same, selecting from the same
        range of ingredients, whether it is being used for painting a portrait
        on a prepared wooden panel, or a decorative scene on glass, or the
        details on a cast metal object.</p>
    <p>Almost all the individual painting materials—pigments, binding media, and
        varnish ingredients—mentioned in Ms. Fr. 640 are those found in other
        similar sources written or compiled at about the same date. One example
        is a manuscript compiled in the Kingdom of Naples around 1570 (so more
        or less contemporary with Ms. Fr. 640), and now in the Biblioteca
        Nazionale Marciana in Venice: Ms. It. III. 10, better known as the
        Marciana Manuscript from its partial publication in the nineteenth
        century by Mary Philadelphia Merrifield.<a href="#fn2"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref2"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> In some respects the two
        manuscripts are comparable: instructions for methods of gilding and,
        interestingly, painting on glass (fols. <a

           role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> are given about the same amount
        of attention in each and both contain varnish recipes, although the
        varnish recipes found in the Marciana Manuscript are more varied and
        more numerous. However, there is a marked difference between the two in
        the treatment of painting. The Marciana Manuscript contains a selection
        of recipes for the preparation or manufacture of common pigments,
        including lead white, vermilion, and copper salts used as blue pigments,
        typical of those found in other books of “secrets” produced in large
        numbers during the sixteenth century; these are not found in Ms. Fr.
        640. On the other hand, little attention is devoted to painting methods
        in the Marciana Manuscript, whereas the French manuscript describes the
        behaviour of oil paint in practice, including some practical
        instructions, so that the right combination of oil and pigment can be
        chosen for the required purpose.</p>
    <p>Ms. Fr. 640 (and, to a lesser extent, the Marciana manuscript) has a
        different approach to the discussion of painting and pigments to that
        found generally in most “Secrets” books, such as the <em>Secreti</em> of
        Alessio Piemontese, very probably a pseudonym for Girolamo Ruscelli, an
        author mentioned in the list of books and authors in Ms. Fr. 640 on fol.
        1r. The first edition in French of this very popular book was published
        in Antwerp in 1557;<a href="#fn4"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref4"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> two editions were published in
        Lyon in 1558 with many following thereafter. Recipes from it were also
        copied by other authors. Much of the section on painting in Johannes
        Jacob Wecker’s <em>Les secrets et merveilles de nature</em> (Lyon,
        1584)<a href="#fn5"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref5"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> consists of recipes copied from
        Alessio Piemontese, including instructions for “<em>Une couleur bleue
            Indienne parfaite – ou outremer</em>”—that is, extracting lapis
        lazuli ultramarine from the stone—and several recipes for
        copper-containing blue pigments and organic red lake pigments prepared
        from <em>bourre</em>, the shearings from dyed cloth. These pigment
        recipes are typical of those appearing in this variety of “Secrets”
        book, with a wide-ranging content, during the fifteenth, sixteenth, and
        seventeenth centuries; however none are found in Ms. Fr. 640 and this is
        unusual. Equally, the details of handling properties of oil paint,
        mentioned by the author-practitioner, are not usually mentioned in other
        “secrets” books like those of Alessio Piemontese and Johannes Jacob
        Wecker.<a href="#fn6"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref6"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> The compilers of “secrets” books
        tended to copy from other sources, however, including other books of
        “secrets,” whereas, to a large extent, the author-practitioner of Ms.
        Fr. 640 does not appear to have done this, at least as far as practical
        painting is concerned.</p>
    <p>Ms. Fr. 640 discusses the properties of pigments and paint from a
        practical point of view, in some cases in a detail that is not found
        elsewhere at this date. One useful source to compare with it is the
        well-known manuscript compiled by Theodore de Mayerne between 1620 and
        1646, “Pictoria, sculptoria et quae subalternarum artium,” MS Sloane
        2052 (London, British Library). Although this manuscript is some forty
        years later, Mayerne gained practical information on pigments, oils, and
        varnishes from painters—often named—and there are some similarities in
        the information given.<a href="#fn7"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref7"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
    <p>A substantial proportion of the comments on painting and pigments are
        grouped together (with some of the varnish recipes) on fols. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/56r/f/56r/tl"><u>56</u></a>–<a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/67r/f/67r/tl"><u>67</u></a>
        of Ms. Fr. 640, with a smaller group on fols. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/10r/f/10r/tl"><u>10</u></a>–<a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/11r/f/11r/tl"><u>11</u></a>;
        the remainder are scattered through the manuscript. In fact this
        manuscript is fairly unusual in that much of the information on painting
        it contains gives the impression of having been acquired by observation
        of someone at work, or during conversation with someone trained as a
        painter. The receipt of information—a particular recipe, for
        example—from a named person is quite common in this variety of technical
        literature: an example from the Marciana Manuscript is the advice to use
        milk as a binding medium for blue pigments in fresco painting, received
        from Master Andrea de Salerno.<a href="#fn8"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref8"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> In Ms. Fr. 640, the sources are
        unidentified. It is particularly interesting that some of the comments
        made on the properties or behavior of particular pigments are not found
        elsewhere, or not at this date.</p>
    <p>Some of the more significant comments on painting methods refer to
        painting practice in Flanders and the southern Netherlands in general.
        The use of several layers of chalk mixed with a glue binding medium as
        the preparatory layer—the ground—for a panel was standard in northern
        Europe. The author-practitioner makes the comment that “Flemish painters
        have such panels made by the dozen” (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/60r/f/60r/tl"><u>60r</u></a>),
        which would certainly have been the case in a sophisticated center such
        as Antwerp where panel-making was a recognized trade.<a href="#fn9"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref9"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> The alternative suggestion for
        the first ground layer of ashes mixed with the chalk (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/57r/f/57r/tl"><u>57r</u></a>),
        while not specific to Flemish painting, is notable as an earlier
        reference to a practice mentioned in Spanish treatises by Francesco
        Pacheco (<em>Arte de la pintura</em>, Seville 1649) and Antonio Palomino
        (<em>El Museo pictórico y escala óptica</em>, Madrid 1715–24).
        Analytical evidence of the use of ashes for this purpose—they are
        calcite-rich but have a morphology distinct from that of chalk—was first
        noted in works by Velasquez and other Spanish artists at the Prado,
        Madrid, and then subsequently confirmed through identification of
        specific calcite pseudomorphs at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New
        York. It has been suggested that this is a specifically Spanish habit,
        but the reference in Ms. Fr. 640 suggests it might prove to be rather
        more widespread.<a href="#fn10"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref10"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
    <p>“Work of the Flemish” (fols. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/60v/f/60v/tl"><u>60v</u></a>–<a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/61r/f/61r/tl"><u>61r</u></a>),
        a description of painting procedure concentrating on the painting of
        flesh, appears to be a fairly accurate account of practice in the
        southern Netherlands. The description begins, “They do all their works
        in oil with the tip of the <em>pinceau</em>, in the manner of good
        illuminators, and grind their colors very finely…,” and attention is
        paid to the handling of the brush, describing the use of the point or
        the flat of the brush in the painting and highlighting of round objects
        (<i><u>Fig. 1</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 2</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 3</u></i>).<a
           href="#fn11"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref11"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> In a passage not specifically
        linked with Flemish painting practice, the author-practitioner comments
        that at least three layers of flesh color are needed when painting flesh
        in oil, beginning by placing the “black and umber where it is
        appropriate” (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/58r/f/58r/tl"><u>58r</u></a>);
        in other words, by indicating the areas of flesh that are to be in
        shadow with a dark-colored paint, subsequently applying the flesh color
        and lead white highlights. This is rather similar to the description of
        painting faces in <em>destrempe</em>—distemper or glue size—on canvas,
        wetting the reverse of the canvas with a sponge to allow the paint to
        flow, which suggests that the canvas was unprimed (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/93v/f/93v/tl"><u>93v</u></a>).<a

        using the brown pigment bistre, followed by the layers of flesh-colored
        paint. Paintings on canvas in an animal glue binding medium were
        produced and traded in very large numbers throughout the fifteenth and
        sixteenth centuries, although their fragility has meant that relatively
        few have survived. In those cases where scientific examination has been
        possible, it appears that the canvas was primed with animal skin glue
        and, in some cases, a thin ground layer.<a href="#fn13"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref13"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> Particular attention is paid to
        the painting of shadows on flesh, in tempera and oil, with the use of
        different pigments being suggested for men and women. For men this
        includes a black “which tends towards yellow, to make beautiful shadows
        in oil, for the shadow, especially that of men, is yellowish”:
        <em>geiete</em> (jet in some form) is suggested, mixed with yellow ocher
        and white (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/65r/f/65r/tl"><u>65r</u></a>).
        For women, blacks “which make a greenish black”—<em>un noir
            verdastre</em>—are suitable (the author-practitioner leaves a space
        for a suitable black to be inserted later), mixed with with sap green
        and <em>bistre</em>; later <em>aspalthe</em> (asphaltum or similar),
        umber, and red lake are suggested (fols. <a

        Here the author-practitioner also refers briefly to Italian and German
        practice (fols. <a

        and makes the perceptive comment that shadows closer to the light need
        to be lighter and softer than those in darker areas: “The Italians
        commonly make three shadows, the first one, of light, very clear, the
        second one darker &amp; the third one quite strong, then blend these
        three shadows together by hatching them from the darkest to the
        clearest”—<em>le plus obscur jusques au plus cler</em> (fol. <a

    <p>An interesting comment, entitled “Double layers,” refers to applying more
        than one layer of paint: “The Flemish &amp; those who paint panels by
        the dozen only make one layer &amp; finish at the first go. But the
        colors soon die. And when they are layered twice, they do not die. One
        needs to layer them lightly &amp; not very thick, to soften them well”
        (fol. <a

            opdoen</em> to describe painting the picture by the application of a
        single layer of paint over a thin translucent priming over the drawing,
        mixing the required shades on the palette, rather than first applying an
        underlayer (that is, employing two or even more layers of paint). The
        result was a paint that was not heavily applied, but thin and sparingly
        laid on, “glowing and clean,” in Van Mander’s words:</p>

        about 1535, died 1575) and many others. The technique was also ideally
        suited for mass production of panels of a popular subject which could be
        sold cheaply. As the paint film aged, however, it became more

        “die” is used fairly frequently in sixteenth- and seventeenth-century
        sources discussing painting to indicate a variety of changes that could
        take place in the paint film, including fading, darkening, sinking of
        the pigment within the film so that the oil formed a skin on the
        surface, or sinking of the oil itself, or increasing translucency, the
        most likely in this case. The effects of fading, increasing

    <h2 id="painting-materials-and-methods">Painting Materials and Methods</h2>
    <p>The painting materials and techniques described by the
        author-practitioner of Ms. Fr. 640 are those used in one branch of
        painting or another during the sixteenth century, in both oil and
        aqueous binding media. Most of the comments are concerned with oil
        painting.</p>
    <p>On the whole, walnut oil was more commonly used in southern Europe,
        including southern France, while linseed oil was used further north,
        although this did depend to some extent on the materials being used, the
        work being carried out, and availability. The author-practitioner makes
        the interesting comment, rarely mentioned in other sources at this date,
        that oils dry more quickly in the south, also commenting that there was
        no better oil than walnut, saying that “it does not dry out too soon nor
        too late” and is also light in color (fols. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/60r/f/60r/tl"><u>60r</u></a>,
        <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/63r/f/63r/tl"><u>63r</u></a>),
        although no other drying oil is mentioned for comparison. It is,
        however, true that walnut oil is initially lighter in color than linseed
        oil and dries slightly more slowly. Allowing the oil (walnut or linseed)
        to stand in the light would bleach and also thicken it (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/60r/f/60r/tl"><u>60r</u></a>).
        In fact, it is quite common to find both of these oils used in different
        areas of the same painting, with linseed used more generally and walnut
        in colors where a more yellow color would be a disadvantage, such as
        whites, mauves, and blues.<a href="#fn21"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref21"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
    <p>Both linseed and walnut are drying oils; in other words they gradually
        form a solid film as their constituents, polyunsaturated carboxylic
        acids, cross-link by the action of oxygen in the air. The oil can be
        modified, in fact thickened, prepolymerized, in chemical terms, to
        increase its drying ability or to change its rheological properties by
        heating, with or without the addition of metal salts—including pigments
        such as minium (lead tetroxide) or verdigris (copper acetate)—or other
        substances known to act as driers. Alternatively it can be allowed to
        stand, usually where it can receive sunlight, covered or uncovered; the
        thickening would be encouraged by the addition of ceruse (lead white) or
        other forms of lead white, lead filings, or calcined pulverized glass
        (fols. <a

           id="fnref22"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a> This is the <em>huile gras</em>,
        or fat oil, described by the author-practitioner as making the colors
        thick and difficult to work, although in practice thickened oils were
        commonly used in easel painting as, depending on how the
        prepolymerization was carried out, the properties the oil acquired
        enabled the artist to achieve particular effects. For fine or intricate
        work a more fluid oil might be preferable and at several points in the
        manuscript the comment is made that the oil should be fresh (so, pale in
        color) and as fluid as possible (fols. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/57v/f/57v/tl"><u>57v</u></a>,
        <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/64r/f/64r/tl"><u>64r</u></a>).
    </p>
    <p>Turpentine spirit, obtained by the distillation of pine resin, and oil of
        spike lavender could be used as diluents for the oil, for painting on
        glass and in varnish making, turpentine being mentioned rather more
        frequently as a varnish ingredient than for use in oil painting, for
        example on fols. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/31r/f/31r/tl"><u>31r</u></a>
        and <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/99v/f/99v/tl"><u>99v</u></a>.
        The author-practitioner makes the useful observation that oil of spike
        lavender penetrates oil paint so well that “painters use it to clean
        their <em>pinceaulx</em> [brushes] when they have become hard, for it
        renders them soft &amp; clean immediately, penetrating the dry color
        which encrusts them,” but its powerful solvent activity also meant that
        care was needed in its use to avoid paint cracking or flaking off (fols.

    <p>Some of the pigments were rarely used in conventional easel painting, but
        had particular applications: dragon’s blood, for example, is described
        as being used over gold where its transparent, red color would be very
        effective for decorative purposes, but it was rarely used otherwise.
        Turmeric could be used similarly (fols. <a

    <p>The author makes some interesting comments about lead white and ceruse.
        Lead white, basic lead carbonate, was the standard white pigment, known
        from antiquity and made by suspending plates of lead over vinegar in
        containers commonly buried in horse manure which maintained a constant
        (warm) temperature and also generated carbon dioxide as it fermented.
        The lead acetate formed initially was converted to the carbonate on
        exposure to the air or carbon dioxide. In most of Europe, including
        France, ceruse was the name given to a form of lead white with a
        proportion of chalk or some similar extender added;<a href="#fn27"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref27"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a> it was therefore slightly less
        opaque and slightly cheaper. This is borne out by the author’s comments
        that flesh colors made using ceruse would go yellow in five or six
        months, whereas lead white did not change (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/58r/f/58r/tl"><u>58r</u></a>).<a

           id="fnref28"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a> Ceruse also had less body (was
        less opaque) than lead white (fols. <a

    <p>In practice, the identification of the pigments is not always
        straightforward; this is the case with some of the blues and greens, for
        example. However, it is important to remember that the painter would be
        choosing to use a pigment for its color and for its other properties,
        including whether it felt gritty or in some other way unpleasant or
        unsuitable; chemical or mineralogical identity was not necessarily at
        the top of the list.</p>
    <p>Pigments vary in their drying ability when mixed with oil. Compounds of
        lead and copper, such as lead white, massicot—at this date lead-tin
        yellow (a double oxide of lead and tin)<a href="#fn30"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref30"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a>—and verdigris (copper acetate)
        all dried well and, as mentioned above, could be used in the treatment
        of oil to improve its drying. Lead white and lead-tin yellow are
        described as the most drying, although they need at least a couple of
        days (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/59v/f/59v/tl"><u>59v</u></a>),

           id="fnref31"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a> The author-practitioner makes
        the helpful suggestion (and another not commonly found elsewhere) that,
        if the reader wants to test whether or not an oil will dry, it should be
        mixed with lead white; if it “produces a crust in a day” (forms a skin),
        it is a drying oil (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/59v/f/59v/tl"><u>59v</u></a>).
        On the other hand, some pigments, including vermilion, lakes, and black
        pigments, were poor driers, and additives were required to help them.
        Verdigris was commonly added to black paint to improve its drying and
        this is suggested in the manuscript (fol. <a

    <h2 id="cristallin-glass-as-an-additive-for-oil-paint"><em>Cristallin</em>
        Glass as an Additive for Oil Paint</h2>
    <p><em>Cristallin</em> is mentioned numerous times as a paint additive in
        Ms. Fr. 640 in different contexts. It is especially helpful in
        understanding the motivation behind its use, as the manuscript is
        exceptional in providing explicit explanations of its purpose and what
        properties it was considered to confer to the oil paint. It is therefore
        worth discussing it in more detail here. The term <em>cristallin</em>—or
        the Italian <em>cristallo</em>—is itself ambiguous, since in
        glass-making recipes the same term is sometimes applied to both the pure
        silica obtained from crushed pebbles (rather than sand) used as one of
        the ingredients and for the high quality, very transparent and colorless
        <em>cristallo</em> glass for which Venice was famous. The latter had
        been developed there in the fifteenth century and its method of
        manufacture remained a carefully guarded secret among the glass makers
        in that city until the technology spread further across Europe during
        the course of the sixteenth century. By the time of Ms. Fr. 640,
        Façon-de-Venise glass was being made in various centers across Europe,
        including Antwerp, Amsterdam, and several locations in France.<a
           href="#fn33"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref33"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
    <p>The distinctive step in the manufacture of <em>cristallo</em> developed
        by the Venetians was the purification of the plant ash that was used as
        a flux. Treatises mentioning powdered glass, however, more often simply
        specify the whitest or least tinted.<a href="#fn34"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref34"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a> Any higher quality colorless
        glass—whether <em>cristallo</em> or the <em>vitrum blanchum</em> of a
        slightly lower grade—contains manganese introduced as a separate
        ingredient or as an impurity in the plant ash, which counteracted the
        greenish tinge caused by iron as an impurity in the silica source.<a
           href="#fn35"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref35"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>35</sup></a> This is of particular interest
        in this context given that the siccative properties of manganese in oil
        paint are well known.</p>
    <p>Almost every reference to <em>cristallin</em> in Ms. Fr. 640 gives
        further information indicating that it is high quality glass that is
        meant rather than crushed silica pebbles. A section on painting (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/57r/f/57r/tl"><u>57r</u></a>)
        states that “Lake takes long to dry in oil and for that reason one must
        grind glass with it. But one needs to choose <em>cristallin</em> because
        it is cleaner.” The same passage goes on to say “And because it would be
        too difficult to grind it as it is, one must redden it in the fire, then
        once completely red throw it into cold water and it will crumble and
        become powdery and then be ground easily.” This process is encompassed
        by the term “calcined glass” used elsewhere in the manuscript as a
        shorthand to indicate its preparation (fols. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/60r/f/60r/tl"><u>60r</u></a>,
        <a

        <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/68r/f/68r/tl"><u>68r</u></a>).
    </p>
    <p>Later it is stated that “It is ground with lake and with
        <em>aspalthe</em>, which will not dry for a very long time without it”
        (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/58r/f/58r/tl"><u>58r</u></a>).
        The use of powdered glass as a drier specifically for oil paint with red
        lake and black pigments such as <em>aspalte</em> is also regularly found
        in the other treatises that mention this practice.<a href="#fn36"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref36"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>36</sup></a> It would have been better than
        other siccatives for red lake in particular, since it was translucent
        (like lakes) so that it would not compromise the optical properties of
        the paint, especially when used for glazes, and also would not have
        adversely affected the color of these relatively expensive pigments. As
        the English painter Marshall Smith wrote in 1692, it would “not in the
        least Tinge the purest Colours.”<a href="#fn37"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref37"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>37</sup></a> The earliest treatises in which
        powdered glass is mentioned as an addition to oil paint do not indicate
        its function, even if the context suggests it could have been a
        siccative. Richard Haydocke seems to have been the first to state this
        explicitly—for orpiment bound in oil—in his 1598 translation of Gian
        Paolo Lomazzo’s <em>Trattato dell’arte della pittura, scoltura et
            architettura</em>, although only in a very brief marginal note that
        does not appear in the original Italian treatise. By the first half of
        the seventeenth century it was mentioned as a drier more often, and with
        more detail about the type of glass and how it should be prepared, as
        well as the circumstances in which it should be used. The earliest
        manuscript with this more extensive information that had been noted
        before was that compiled by Theodore de Mayerne between 1620 and 1646
        (MS Sloane 2052). The very comparable references to pulverized glass in
        Ms. Fr. 640 are considerably earlier in date. Mayerne, too, specifically
        recommends <em>cristallin</em>, as does the more or less contemporary
        manuscript of 1635 by Pierre le Brun.<a href="#fn38"

    <p>High quality clear glass does indeed seem to have been the type used as
        an additive in paintings, as is evident from the results of quantitative
        analysis of glass in paint samples. While the references in treatises in
        connection to its potential siccative qualities had long been noted—it
        was discussed at some length already by Merrifield in the mid-nineteenth
        century—it was only relatively recently that it was possible to prove
        its presence in painting through technical investigations. Having first
        been confirmed in Italian works of the sixteenth century, a broader
        study of more than seventy works in the National Gallery, London, showed
        that it was also routinely employed in Netherlandish and German
        paintings (<i><u>Fig. 7</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 8</u></i>). Interestingly,
        among the earliest of these was Jan van Eyck’s <em>Arnolfini
            Portrait</em>, which, given this artist’s importance in the
        development of oil painting, perhaps adds significance to this material
        in the history of painting technique. Although fewer French paintings
        have been investigated with this material in mind, several examples in
        works of the fifteenth and sixteenth century have been confirmed.<a

    <p>In line with what is mentioned in the treatises, including Ms. Fr. 640,
        the pulverized glass was found mixed with red lake in all of the
        paintings in the study. Its use in primings is also frequent, with some
        examples too in blacks and mordants for gilding. A few artists—notably
        Raphael and Hans Holbein the Elder—employed it much more widely.<a
           href="#fn40"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref40"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>40</sup></a> Although historic texts most
        commonly mention it as a drier, surely an indicator that this was often
        at least one possible reason artists added it to their paint, there has
        been much debate about whether this was its primary function or whether
        its effect on optical and physical properties, including consistency and
        handling could in fact have been equally if not more important.<a

        from doubts as to whether the manganese in the glass, while well known
        to act as a siccative, is sufficiently mobile to interact with the oil;
        it may be that the alkali content proves to be more important in this
        respect. Whatever the outcome of the further experiments needed to
        provide decisive proof that it is effective for this purpose, artists
        could still have used it in the belief that it could perform this
        function (at least in oil paintings, rather than the other contexts in
        which this material is sometimes mentioned). This does not preclude the
        possibility that they appreciated, in addition, any effect it had on the
        optical or handling properties of the paint. The study on paintings in
        the National Gallery, however, indicated a large variability in particle
        size and it should be remembered that the influence of coarse glass
        powder and much more finely ground glass will be very different,
        therefore it is not possible to generalize about its influence on the
        consistency and viscosity of the oil paint.</p>
    <p>Pulverized colorless glass is nevertheless also employed for other
        purposes in other branches of the arts and Ms. Fr. 640 is especially
        interesting in this respect. Its use for casting is mentioned in Ms. Fr.
        640 (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/68r/f/68r/tl"><u>68r</u></a>),
        but more relevant in relation to oil paint is a passage on glazing (fol.
        <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/65v/f/65v/tl"><u>65</u></a>),
        where its purpose is clearly intended to increase the transparency of
        the paint: “One commonly glazes with colors that do not have body, such
        as lake &amp; verdigris. However, to use other colors, one mixes in a
        quantity of calcined &amp; ground <em>cristallin</em>, which also has no
        body &amp; <del>makes</del> lightens the density of the others.” Here
        the translation is challenging, especially for the last
        phrase—“<em>esclarcist l’espesseur des aultres</em>”—which seems to
        express an increase in clarity and transparency concurrent with a
        decrease in opacity and covering power.<a href="#fn42"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref42"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>42</sup></a> The repeated statements that
        ground glass is lacking in “body” are valuable in understanding the
        meaning of the term in this context and also what properties the
        author-practitioner considered powdered glass to possess. A note in the
        margin of fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/65r/f/65r/tl"><u>65r</u></a>
        states that “Every color or thing that becomes dense when water is put
        in during the grinding has body. But those which do not have it, such as
        pestled glass, lake, &amp;c, become clear.” Like sugar, powdered glass
        appears white when it is dry and its translucency, or lack of body,
        becomes apparent when it is mixed with a liquid. The phrase in a passage
        on painting, “<em>Cristallin</em> when ground in water appears to have
        body, but in oil it does not have any” (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/58r/f/58r/tl"><u>58r</u></a>),
        might appear contradictory when taken out of context, but probably
        refers to a water-based medium juxtaposed against oil where the former,
        once dry, would indeed appear opaque. The challenges of translation and
        the idiosyncratic phrasing are again apparent here. Importantly, this
        passage on glazing is not in reference to paintings but to decoration of
        cast metallic objects, where paints that allowed the metal to shine
        through were required. Here it is being advised for use with opaque
        pigments for a specific purpose, to render the paint more transparent.
        Conversely, when mentioned as a siccative it is most often for the poor
        drier, red lake, a pigment that was inherently transparent. Experienced
        and practical artists and artisans in this period, however, are likely
        to have had no difficulty in making a distinction between the uses of

    <p>The author-practitioner’s comments on blues are sufficiently extensive
        and interesting to merit a separate discussion. As mentioned above, the
        main blue pigments used in the late sixteenth century were azurite (see
        Fig. 7), smalt, natural ultramarine, indigo, and blue ashes (<em>cendres
            d’azur</em>).<a href="#fn43"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref43"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>43</sup></a> This last term is a color name
        designating a lower quality of blue rather than a specific pigment and
        could be various different materials; Samuel van Hoogstraten indeed
        mentions three different types, saying that “for our blues...we have
        English, German, and Haarlem ashes.”<a href="#fn44"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref44"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>44</sup></a> Even so, the name was used most
        often for the artificial blue copper carbonate (an example is shown in
        Fig. 16), chemically the same as mineral azurite, but could also be
        ultramarine ashes (a low grade of ultramarine), or even vivianite, a
        soft and dullish blue iron phosphate found in peat bogs.<a href="#fn45"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref45"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>45</sup></a> The term <em>azur</em> is often
        used in a general way in Ms. Fr. 640 for the color blue. Occasionally,
        however, it is applied specifically for the mineral azurite, as in the
        passage that mentions “...mines where ​​azur​​ or ​<em>vert d’azur</em>​
        is found” (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/11r/f/11r/tl"><u>11r</u></a>),
        which clearly refers to the blue and green copper carbonates usually
        found together as secondary minerals in areas of copper deposits. A
        passage on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/11r/f/11r/tl"><u>11r</u></a>
        states that “Azure ashes are only good for landscapes because they die
        in oil. Only true azure holds on.” True azure—<em>azur vray</em>—must
        also refer to the natural copper carbonate mineral azurite, with the
        word “true” signifying the contrast with azure ashes, the synthetic
        equivalent or a low quality grade of the natural azurite. The only
        possible reference to the pigment ultramarine—<em>Azur
            d’acre</em>—includes a qualifier that indicates an origin connected
        with trade from the east into Europe, identifying it unambiguously.<a
           href="#fn46"

           id="fnref46"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>46</sup></a> <em>Azur commun</em> (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/10r/f/10r/tl"><u>10r</u></a>)—ordinary
        azur—is advised as a base layer beneath red lake to make purple. In this
        particular context this is perhaps most likely to mean indigo, since it
        goes on to say “or better yet <em>azur d’esmail</em>” and neither
        azurite nor ultramarine could be considered inferior to smalt. Elsewhere
        <em>florey</em>, which is certainly indigo, is specified.</p>
    <p>Over the course of the sixteenth century the blue pigment smalt was
        introduced onto the artist’s palette and by the second half of the
        century it was extremely widely used (<i><u>Fig. 9</u></i>). It is
        therefore not surprising that <em>azur d’esmail</em>, the French term
        for this pigment, is by far the most commonly mentioned blue in Ms. Fr.
        640, especially since it was cheap enough to be used not only for high
        art forms but for paint for all the various decorative purposes with
        which this manuscript is concerned. On fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/11r/f/11r/tl"><u>11r</u></a>
        it states that “Those who make it in Germany compound it like enamel, in
        large pieces which they pestle, &amp; pass through several sieves &amp;
        wash.” As enamel is a vitreous material this confirms its identity,
        since smalt is indeed a glass, colored blue with cobalt (<i><u>Fig. 10</u></i>). The association with Germany is also significant,
        since in the sixteenth century smalt was made in only a very limited
        number of places, including in Germany close to the only cobalt ore
        deposits in Europe that were being exploited in that period, and in the
        Netherlands, due to the control they had managed to establish over the
        trade in cobalt ore from Germany.<a href="#fn47"

    <p>A limited number of recipes for smalt pigment can be found in historic
        documentary sources, such as that from the notebooks of the Darduin
        glass-making family who were active in Murano. It includes river
        pebbles, which are the source of the silica. Tartar (potassium
        carbonate) is the flux, added to lower the melting temperature of the
        glass, although in smalt it is also important in maintaining the blue
        color and is more effective in this function than the soda ash (sodium
        carbonate) used in other types of glass. The third ingredient in this
        recipe, well-calcined or roasted zaffre, was a mixture of roasted cobalt
        ore and varying amounts of quartz or sand.<a href="#fn49"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref49"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>49</sup></a> What is important to note is
        that smalt pigment is always a potash glass containing only potassium as
        the alkali. This is not the case for true enameling of a blue color
        found, for example, on Limousin enamels or for decoration on glass or
        metal objects. There is nevertheless a close association, since smalt
        could be used as the coloring material, which then needed to be mixed
        with a white or colorless glass such as the leaded silicate
        <em>rocaille</em> that melted at the low temperature needed for the
        enamel so that it did not disrupt the substrate on which it was laid.
        This is exemplified by the recipe on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/31v/f/31v/tl"><u>31v</u></a>:
        “For blue, they take the coarsest <em>azur d’esmail</em> &amp; grind it
        on shale, &amp; mix in two or three rosary beads’ worth of rocaille or
        more….” Although entitled “Painting on glass” it is clearly for
        enameling, since the final phrase states “Then they heat it up.”</p>
    <p>Like the equivalent Italian name <em>smalto</em>, the pigment name
        <em>azur d’esmail</em> can create confusion that makes it difficult to
        know when to translate it as blue enamel and when as smalt pigment.
        However, in the manuscript compiled by Theodore de Mayerne (MS Sloane
        2052) it is reduced to only the single word <em>email</em> in his list
        of blue pigments, so it must have been well understood in this period
        that this designated the blue pigment smalt.<a href="#fn50"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref50"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>50</sup></a></p>
    <p>Many treatises mention the poor working properties of azurite,
        ultramarine, and especially smalt, which arise from the need for these
        to be used in a more coarsely ground form than other pigments because
        they become weaker in color as the particle size decreases (<i><u>Fig. 11</u></i>). Aside from making the paint gritty and difficult to
        use, it meant that the oil absorption of these pigments was high so that
        they were more likely to suffer from other problems such as darkening or
        sinking. Various writers, especially in the seventeenth century,
        therefore give attention to how these shortcomings can be ameliorated,
        and how these materials could be further processed in the studio to
        produce a finer pigment.<a href="#fn51"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref51"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>51</sup></a> This might seem contradictory,
        but was presumably to reach a compromise between a more intense color
        and a paint that could be applied and manipulated more easily.</p>

    <p>The author-practitioner, too, addresses many of these issues, noting that
        “every kind of azure is difficult” (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/59r/f/59r/tl"><u>59r</u></a>),
        especially smalt (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/11r/f/11r/tl"><u>11r</u></a>).
        He repeats the common advice to take “the most delicate” or finest in
        many places (fols. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/11r/f/11r/tl"><u>11r</u></a>,

        and suggests trying it on the fingernail or palette to see if it is
        sandy (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/11r/f/11r/tl"><u>11r</u></a>).
        Elsewhere, he comments that painters take their palette to the grocers
        so they can grind it with some white to assess the intensity of its
        color (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/93v/f/93v/tl"><u>93v</u></a>),
        which was dependent not only on the particle size but also on the amount
        of cobalt ore used in its manufacture, but at the same time does not
        neglect to consider its handling properties, saying “The most delicate
        is the best for working. It is made finer [<em>Il se subtilie</em>]
        <del>working</del> by washing it.” The final result produced by such a
        process is indicated by the author-practitioner’s use of
        “<em>subtil</em>” in the context of other materials, such as molding
        sand: “to render all of it fine [<em>subtil</em>] &amp; impalpable”
        (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/68v/f/68v/tl"><u>68v</u></a>),
        where impalpable means that no grittiness can be felt between the
        fingers. An English treatise of 1573 uses similar sensory language for
        smalt of suitably small particle size: the author advises to choose
        smalt “which is bright of colour, and not harshe, but softe betwene the
        fingers.”<a href="#fn52"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref52"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>52</sup></a> Marshall Smith, too, a century
        later states “the best Smalt is the deepest and soft like Butter between

    <p>There are many references scattered through Ms. Fr. 640 to the washing of
        smalt, first to remove impurities and then as a way of separating the
        pigment into different fractions of successively finer particles through
        levigation, as described in the passage on fol. <a

    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>The author-practitioner writes about this
        in the first person, as if he has experimented himself with the methods
        that have been recommended to him. The first wash he mentioned would
        have been to remove any impurities; he explains on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/93v/f/93v/tl"><u>93v</u></a>
        that “the filth that can be perceived in the wash water makes it die.”
        The further washing, as is clear from his description, is instead to
        separate out the finer pigment through levigation. Like other authors,
        he discusses the difficulties in processing the pigment after purchase
        to this end while still retaining a good color. At the end of the above
        passage he concludes that it is better to achieve a finer pigment
        without grinding, through levigation, and here as well as elsewhere he
        notes that with grinding it loses its tint.<a href="#fn55"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref55"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>55</sup></a> It might, therefore, seem
        contradictory to start the passage with the advice to grind it well, but
        in thinking through the practicalities his rather shorthand notes are
        more comprehensible. Grinding alone will produce a wide range of
        particle sizes, with the very finest and palest diluting the hue of any
        medium-fine pigment that would have optimal balance between working
        properties and color. In washing, however, these finer, lighter
        particles can be separated off as they are suspended in the liquid. The
        last sentence mentions that it is sieved during manufacture, but the
        pigment produced in this way would still be relatively coarse, as it is
        not effective below a certain particle size. Any further refinement
        needed to be achieved through washing, and although this was no doubt
        also done by the manufacturer it may not have been sufficient, perhaps
        explaining why artists felt the need to process the pigment further
        themselves.<a href="#fn56"

    <p>Having refined the pigment, Ms. Fr. 640 gives various different hints on
        how to use smalt as a paint, mainly addressing the issues arising from
        the high oil absorption. Pricking the surface on which it was to be
        applied, for example (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/11r/f/11r/tl"><u>11r</u></a>),
        would have allowed excess oil to sink into the substrate so that, as he
        notes, the paint would not run. This otherwise seems to have been
        mentioned only by Karel van Mander in 1604 (<i><u>Fig. 12</u></i>) and
        no evidence has been found on extant paintings that it was part of
        regular practice.<a href="#fn59"

    <p>Verdigris was probably still the most widely used green pigment in
        sixteenth-century oil painting. Its transparency permitted the
        production of richly colored green glazes over gold or silver (<i><u>Fig. 13</u></i>) and, like other translucent pigments, it was
        ideally suited for painting on glass, as the author-practitioner
        describes (fols. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/39v/f/39v/tl"><u>39v</u></a>,

           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/65v/f/65v/tl"><u>65v</u></a>).
        In conventional easel painting this property was exploited in the
        painting of draperies (see Fig. 7), although, mixed with other pigments,
        it was also used for landscape. Chemically it is a basic copper
        acetate,<a href="#fn63"

        <em>Verdet</em> is defined by Randle Cotgrave as a form of verdigris and
        it is certainly a synthetic copper salt. In a manuscript written by
        Pierre Lebrun in 1635, <em>verdet</em> is described as being prepared
        from copper or brass filings sprinkled with old urine and sal ammoniac
        (ammonium chloride), dried in the sun and sprinkled with the same
        materials until they become green.<a href="#fn64"

        a <em>verdet</em> distilled for glazing suggests a form of verdigris and

        sand; this could describe green verditer (a synthetic basic copper
        carbonate) or green earth (a naturally occurring iron potassium silicate
        mineral pigment containing glauconite or celadonite, depending on the
        source). Lebrun says of “<em>verd de terre</em>” that the best comes
        from Smyrna: “<em>la craye verte ou verd de terre vient de la terre de
            Smyrne et est la plus excellente</em>”; later he uses the name
        <em>terre verd</em> for the pigment, all of which suggests green earth,
        rather than green verditer.<a href="#fn66"

    <p>The author devotes rather more attention to the translucent red lake
        pigments than to the opaque and widely used vermilion, red mercuric
        sulfide, more widely used in the synthetic form than as the natural
        mineral cinnabar (see Figs. 4 and 6 for examples of vermilion in paint).
        Synthetic or natural, the color could vary from a reddish orange—as the
        author-practitioner says, hardly different from minium—to a dark red.
        The author-practitioner’s description of it as <em>blaffart et
            palle</em>—wan or bleak and pale—(fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/57r/f/57r/tl"><u>57r</u></a>)
        is slightly unexpected for what is usually a strongly colored pigment;
        perhaps the examples available were rather dull in color, but the
        pigment was commonly adulterated with minium (red lead), brick dust, or
        even lime,<a href="#fn71"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref71"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>71</sup></a> all of which could affect the
        color. Grinding it on a slab immediately after grinding red lake is
        suggested (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/57r/f/57r/tl"><u>57r</u></a>).
        The addition of a little red lake pigment to give some vibrancy to the
        color, suggested by the author-practitioner on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/64r/f/64r/tl"><u>64r</u></a>,
        is quite often found in practice.</p>
    <p>The lakes were manufactured pigments, made by precipitating or adsorbing
        a dye onto a suitable substrate, commonly amorphous alumina hydrate, but
        chalk or even lead white could be used; in the last-named case the
        pigment is not translucent. Strongly colored and translucent in the oil
        binding medium (<i><u>Fig. 14</u></i>), red lakes were commonly used as
        glazing pigments, as described by the author-practitioner on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/65v/f/65v/tl"><u>65v</u></a>,
        applied over red or pink paint, often containing vermilion, to give
        shadow and structure to drapery folds, or over blues to give purples as
        mentioned above (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/10r/f/10r/tl"><u>10r</u></a>).
        At this time the sources of dye were those used in dyeing: the expensive
        insect dyes kermes and the New World cochineal;<a href="#fn72"
           class="footnote-ref"

           role="doc-noteref"><sup>72</sup></a> lac, also an insect dye, less
        often used on textiles but widely used in pigments; madder and the
        soluble redwood brazilwood (the south-east Asian variety sappanwood was
        probably also available). Of these, kermes, cochineal, and madder lakes
        were made from clippings or shearings of cloth, extracting the dye in
        alkali (such as that prepared from wood ashes, essentially potassium
        carbonate) and precipitating the pigment by the addition of potash alum
        (aluminum potassium sulfate); lac and brazilwood lakes were generally
        made directly from the raw material.<a href="#fn73"

    <p>As far as the pigments made using dyes extracted from cloth were
        concerned, it was not necessarily clear to anyone buying a lake pigment
        which dye was present, although by the 1580s, in Italy at least, names
        under which lakes were bought were beginning to be more informative and
        it seems very possible that lakes described or named as
        crimson—<em>cremese</em> and similar names—contained cochineal
        dyestuff.<a href="#fn74"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref74"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>74</sup></a> In general, however, in most
        western European languages, most red lakes were simply known as “lake.”
        They were available in different shades of red, depending partly on the
        dyestuff present; those containing madder were usually a more orange red
        rather than the crimsons or bluer reds given by the insect dyes.<a
           href="#fn75"

           id="fnref75"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>75</sup></a> The author suggests the use of
        as red and as lively a lake as possible for the painting of flesh, as
        too purple a lake gave a cold color and the very dark variety was
        unsuitable (fols. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/58r/f/58r/tl"><u>58r</u></a>,

           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/61r/f/61r/tl"><u>61r</u></a>).
        For violet too, the blue pigment used should be glazed with a lake which
        “on a polished knife or on glass gives a clear color of red rose,
        tending a little towards violet” (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/93v/f/93v/tl"><u>93v</u></a>);
        the dark-red variety was not as pleasant. On the other hand, a more
        purple shade was an advantage if the lake was to be used to make purple
        by glazing over a layer of blue paint: mixing alum with it to make it
        more violet in color is suggested (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/10r/f/10r/tl"><u>10r</u></a>).
        The addition of too much alum while the lake was being made also
        resulted in a more purple or violet color (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/58r/f/58r/tl"><u>58r</u></a>).
        Both comments suggest that the author-practitioner knew, or had been
        talking to, someone with experience of making the pigment, or had tried
        it in person; the effect on the color of adding too much (or additional)
        alum is rarely mentioned at this date. The tendency to become more
        purple can be observed in the case of lakes containing cochineal dye,
        which would probably have become common by the 1570s or 1580s.<a

    <p>The names used for lakes usually referred either to places that supplied
        good quality pigments, or to some physical property such as the shape in
        which the dry pigment was supplied. The author writes that the lake from
        Florence is better than that from Flanders “for in Florence the best
        dyes are made” (fol. 58r); the comment that it was used as a rouge also
        suggests that it was not an unflattering bluish crimson. Interestingly,
        however, the comment is also made that, whereas a good lake will darken
        immediately if wetted with saliva (light scatter from the surface is
        reduced by wetting), that from Florence is “too gummed (<em>trop</em>
        <em>gommee</em>)” (fol. <a

        blood. <em>Laque platte</em> refers to the shaping or cutting of the wet
        paste of finished pigment into flat squares or tablets, which are then
        allowed to dry and kept for use; this was quite widely done.<a

    <p>One red lake that had had its own name for several centuries was that
        prepared from the dye extracted from brazilwood or sappanwood (the

        in Ms. Fr. 640, and very similar names in other languages (see Fig. 22
        below). Modifications of the making process gave an ink and other
        recipes using brazilwood gave other colors, but roset seems to have been
        particularly popular. The version favored by the author-practitioner
        with ceruse in the substrate (fol. <a

    <h2 id="yellow-pigments">Yellow Pigments</h2>
    <p>An important use for yellow pigments was to make green colors, either by
        mixtures with or glazing over blue (<i><u>Fig. 15</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 16</u></i>), or by mixtures with green, particularly
        verdigris. In Ms. Fr. 640, yellow ocher, orpiment, massicot (lead-tin
        yellow), and <em>stil de grain</em> yellow are all mentioned for that
        purpose, as much for painting decorative and molded items (as described
        on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/158v/f/158v/tl"><u>158v</u></a>)
        as for any other purpose. <em>Stil de grain</em> yellow is particularly
        interesting from this point of view as it is a form of lake pigment,
        made from a yellow dye with the addition of potash alum and, usually,
        chalk, in a very similar way to the brazilwood pigment roset. The use of
        a wood ash or similar alkali as a precipitating agent for making yellow
        lakes was uncommon at this date. The source of dye was either weld (<i><u>Fig. 17</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 18</u></i>), a pigment the
        author-practitioner describes as being made in Lyon (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/10r/f/10r/tl"><u>10r</u></a>),
        or dyer’s broom (fol. <a

        conventional easel painting. Here, and particularly in the painting of
        landscape, yellow lake pigments came to be used more frequently from the
        early decades of the sixteenth century onwards. These pigments were made
        using chalk or a similar calcium salt, and in an oil medium were
        translucent, like the red lake pigments. In mixtures to give the darker

    <p>In practice, the presence of yellow lake pigments in easel paintings is
        quite hard to confirm, partly because the dyes from which they are made
        are quite fugitive, but also because even where the color survives its
        presence is difficult to confirm through analysis. As a result, the only
        sign that such a pigment may be present in a mixture is the unexpected
        presence of a marked amount of a calcium salt in a paint layer where a
        yellow might have been expected.</p>
    <p>Unlike the red lakes, the names for yellow lakes vary from country to
        country in sixteenth-century Europe: for example, <em>arzica</em> and
        <em>giallo santo</em> in Italy, <em>pincke</em> in England,
        <em>Schietgelb</em> and <em>schijtgeel</em> in Germany and the northern
        and southern Netherlands respectively, to name but a few, all with
        varying spellings. <em>Stil de grain</em> was the recognized name in
        seventeenth-century France and the evidence of Ms. Fr. 640 shows it was
        in use earlier. However, in the seventeenth century, the name was
        usually associated with a pigment made using the juice of unripe
        buckthorn berries, <em>grains d’Avignon</em>, not one prepared from weld
        or dyer’s broom.<a href="#fn83"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref83"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>83</sup></a> This more golden-yellow or
        golden-brown pigment appears to have been very much less popular at an
        earlier date; most recipes for the pigments describe the use of weld or
        dyer’s broom (like Ms. Fr. 640). Perhaps <em>stil de grain</em> was a
        name for the pigment in France even in cases where the yellow dye used
        was not that obtained from unripe berries.</p>
    <p>The author-practitioner mentions the golden-yellow arsenic trisulfide
        pigment orpiment in the context of supplying a gold color in place of
        gilding itself; the related orange arsenic disulfide, realgar, is only
        mentioned in the context of the founding of soft iron (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/16r/f/16r/tl"><u>16r</u></a>),
        not as a pigment. To obtain a deeper, more orange or golden yellow,
        orpiment could be melted or sublimed (fols. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/9v/f/9v/tl"><u>9v</u></a>,

           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/99v/f/99v/tl"><u>99v</u></a>),
        and by the late sixteenth century a range of synthetic or modified
        arsenic sulfides were being produced on a large scale by dry process
        methods.<a href="#fn84"

    <p>The blacks most commonly mentioned in sixteenth-century treatises on
        painting materials are charcoal black, bone or ivory black, lamp black,
        fruit-stone blacks of different kinds, and black earths.<a href="#fn85"

        in Ms. Fr. 640 is therefore quite typical: “Black of charcoal from the
        mines, of ordinary charcoal, of burnt ivory, of peach pits, of lamp
        smoke, of burnt bones of the feet of oxen.” Many of the references in
        historic treatises make it clear that artists were well aware of the
        differing hues and working properties of these blacks, and that they
        chose which pigment to use accordingly. Bone black gives a deep,
        saturated warm black paint, charcoal black is bluer in tone, while lamp
        black has less body and can have a slightly greasy quality.<a
           href="#fn86"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref86"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>86</sup></a> A passage on velvets and blacks
        in Ms. Fr. 640, for example, states “For blue &amp; green velvets, you
        <del>highlight</del> touch the shading with peach pit black, which is
        very black. For lake, black of pit coal which makes a reddish black on
        lake for velvets” (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/63v/f/63v/tl"><u>63v</u></a>).
        “Soft wood charcoal” is described as bluish and therefore suitable for
        depicting armor (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/63v/f/63v/tl"><u>63v</u></a>).
    </p>
    <p>The “black of charcoal from the mines” (<em>noir de charbon de mine</em>)
        is probably equivalent to black earth. This is not a single material of
        defined composition, but a class of pigments, which could include a
        number of different black minerals. The terms black earth, black chalk,
        and black stone tend to be used interchangeably, both for black pigments
        and drawing materials. Sometimes good geographical sources are
        mentioned, or shreds of information about their properties are given,
        which could provide some clue as to the nature of the pigment. Vasari
        mentions black chalk from the hills of France, and Antonio Filarete
        mentions a black earth from Germany for fresco in his <em>Trattato
            dell’Architettura</em> of the fifteenth century (ca. 1461–4).<a
           href="#fn87"

           role="doc-noteref"><sup>87</sup></a> While these could simply be
        carbonaceous black shales, they could also equate with the black
        pyrolusite (manganese black) that has been identified in numerous
        paintings of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, or the black coal
        that is in fact far more common. Generally it is only in
        seventeenth-century treatises where a pigment that is certainly a coal
        is found. Theodore de Mayerne, for example, mentions <em>charbon de
            pierre</em> and <em>charbon de terre d’Escosse</em>—both common
        coal—and it also appears under the names of <em>sea coal</em> and
        <em>smythe coal</em> (forge coal) in several English treatises of the
        period. The earliest seems to be in <em>The Arte of Limning</em> by
        Nicolas Hilliard dating from the beginning of the seventeenth century;<a

           id="fnref88"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>88</sup></a> it is therefore interesting that
        Ms. Fr. 640 mentions “<em>le noir de charbon de pierre</em>,” translated
        as “pit coal,” as a reddish black for painting velvets (see above).
        Later in the century, Edward Norgate too stated that “sea cole makes a
        Red Blacke,” which is consistent with the warm black appearance of the
        coal that has been identified in paintings.</p>
    <p>Ms. Fr. 640 is unusual in mentioning <em>geiete</em>, jet, which is in
        fact a low grade coal (fol. <a

        recommended for shadows in flesh paint. Coal blacks of different types
        and composition have been found through analysis of paint samples (<i><u>Fig. 19</u></i>), including in one case a lignitic type that
        could well be consistent with jet as a pigment name.<a href="#fn89"

    <p>Gilding, the application of gold or silver leaf to the surface of an
        object, was a popular and widely used decorative technique, often
        applied to painted objects, but also used on its own. Burnished
        gold—gold that has received a high polish by rubbing—has a gleaming,
        shiny appearance, but gold can also appear more yellow and with a
        slightly matte surface if it is not burnished, and the method used to
        apply the gold was chosen according to the appearance desired (<i><u>Fig. 20</u></i>).</p>

    <p>The methods for applying metal leaf described by the author-practitioner
        were fairly traditional, having changed little from previous centuries.
        If the gold (or silver) leaf was to be burnished, it was applied using a
        technique known today as water gilding, on a surface that provided
        cushioning for the leaf and also a degree of “slip,” so that the thin
        leaf would flatten out and take a high polish as it was rubbed with a
        suitable burnishing tool, commonly a polished hard stone such as
        hematite or even the canine tooth of a dog. Traditionally, this surface
        consisted of a slightly greasy, reddish-brown clay, known as Armenian
        bole (the color being given by its content of red iron oxide), or
        sometimes another red-brown earth, mixed with an aqueous binding medium,
        such as an animal skin glue or glair (the liquid from beaten egg white
        that has been allowed to settle out), which served to attach the gold
        laid on top, but also allowed a degree of movement as it was burnished.
        This was essential: if the gold was held firmly, it could not move and
        burnishing was impossible. The reddish color of the bole or other red
        earth gave some warmth to the gold above.<a href="#fn93"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref93"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>93</sup></a> The author-practitioner
        describes the procedure very precisely in “For laying down and setting
        burnished gold and giving red or green or blue” (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/6r/f/6r/tl"><u>6r</u></a>),
        first applying four layers of chalk in a distemper (animal glue) medium,
        followed by a mixture of bole, sanguine (a red-brown earth pigment), a
        little lamb’s fat, a little ground charcoal and half-burnt saffron,
        ground and mixed with water; this would have been greasy and brownish in
        color. It was smoothed with a cloth until it was shiny, wet with a paint
        brush of clean water and the gold applied and burnished when dry. The
        author-practitioner goes on to suggest glazing the gold with red lake or
        verdigris; blue—smalt, <em>azur d’esmail</em>—was better applied over
        silver leaf.</p>
    <p>At the beginning of this passage, the author-practitioner also mentions
        the other gilding method: mordant gilding, in which the gold is applied
        over a mordant layer, essentially an oil paint containing pigments such
        as red or yellow earths and lead-containing pigments: “<em>or mat</em>
        which is made with oil, mixing it with yellow ocher &amp; <em>mine</em>
        [minium]… &amp; tempering all of it with oil.” In this case, the gold is
        held firmly by the mordant and cannot be burnished (<i><u>Fig. 21</u></i>).<a href="#fn94"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref94"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>94</sup></a> The technique was widely used
        for gilding detailed or complex surfaces where burnishing would be
        impractical, but also for applying fine gold details or lettering to
        painted surfaces. This could also be done in an aqueous medium, such as
        the <em>batture</em> described on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/32r/f/32r/tl"><u>32r</u></a>,
        made from “joiner’s glue tempered with water on the fire, moderately
        clear, mixed with very little honey, that is to say a few drops to make
        it stick, and with it they form letters, or that which they want to
        gild, with a <em>pinceau</em>, and immediately after layer the gold.”
        The author-practitioner goes on to say that sugar candy mixed with a
        little sanguine gave neater results, however. The most common mordant
        recommended by the author-practitioner for <em>or mat</em> consisted of
        walnut oil, thickened by being allowed to stand, with or without the
        admixture of a lead-containing pigment to improve drying, mixed with
        several or all of massicot (lead-tin yellow), minium (red lead), yellow
        ocher, and <em>ochre de ru</em> (a dark yellow or yellowish-brown earth
        pigment) (fols. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/66r/f/66r/tl"><u>66r</u></a>,
        <a

        <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/100r/f/100r/tl"><u>100r</u></a>).
        The oil and pigment mixture obtained from cleaning brushes was used by
        some, although the author-practitioner stated that this eventually
        caused the gold to discolor due to the verdigris present (fol. 66r). The
        mordant became sticky quite quickly and the gold, either in the form of
        leaf or as ground or powdered gold, could be applied. Once dry it could
        be varnished. The author-practitioner describes a decorative technique
        for frames consisting of a mordant gilded moresque design (a stylized
        pattern of tendrils and foliage) over black, where the black was painted
        in a glue medium (fol. <a

    <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The author-practitioner’s discussion of painting in Ms. Fr. 640 is
        unusual in many ways. If the comments distributed throughout the text
        are put together, the end result is not the equivalent of an artists’
        manual; this is not the aim. The descriptions of how to paint hair, or
        the faces of old men, or various birds and animals, still almost
        universal in treatises on painting at this time, are absent. There is
        some discussion of painting in aqueous binding media, notably in
        comments on the painting of flesh, but most of the points are on the
        practice of oil painting, that is, how the various pigments behave when
        mixed with the oil, their drying characteristics and the properties of
        the oil. His aims are different to those of other more or less
        contemporary authors writing on oil painting. In most cases, other
        authors focus on the work of easel painters, while the
        author-practitioner writes about the use of oil paint in general. His
        interest appears to lie as much, or rather more, in the decorative
        purposes for which it was used, such as painting cast metal flowers
        (fol. <a

    <p>The earliest published account of oil painting in French appears to be
        the chapter on “Platte peinture” in the Jesuit author Etienne Binet’s
        <em>Essay des merveilles de nature</em>, a very popular book on
        everything from falconry to the rainbow, written under the pseudonym
        René François and first published in 1621. Much of this information was
        copied in Pierre Lebrun’s very much more substantial <em>Recueil des
            essaies des merveilles de la peinture</em>, written in 1635 but
        unpublished.<a href="#fn97"

           role="doc-noteref"><sup>97</sup></a> These are forty or fifty years
        later than Ms. Fr. 640. Italian examples are more numerous, and some,
        such as Giovanni Paolo Lomazzo’s <em>Trattato dell’ arte della pittura,
            scoltura, et architettura</em> (Milan 1584) and Giovann Battista
        Armenini’s <em>De’ veri precetti della pittura</em> (Ravenna 1587), were
        written at much the same time by people who were painters and did
        include practical information, but also a great deal of history and
        commentary on the works of painters.<a href="#fn98"

    <p>There are interesting similarities between some points made in Ms. Fr.
        640 and comments made by Van Mander, not only about sixteenth-century
        Flemish painting. It seems very possible that the author-practitioner
        obtained some of his information from someone who had trained in the
        southern Netherlands, or had a good knowledge of Flemish painting
        practice. That said, where the author-practitioner is discussing the
        work of Flemish or Italian painters, one occasionally has the sense that
        he is describing the practice of an earlier generation; the comment on
        fol. 61r that Flemish painters “do all their works in oil with the tip
        of the <em>pinceau</em>, in the manner of good illuminators” might
        suggest a painter of the early sixteenth century, rather than a
        contemporary artist. On the other hand, his descriptions of the
        behaviour of paint—whether a particular pigment dries well or not; how
        to improve the drying properties of oil paint—are as valid now as they
        were in the later sixteenth century or earlier, and his descriptions of
        smalt and its behavior are entirely contemporary.</p>
    <p>The other account discussing painting from the point of view of how
        painters went about their work is Theodore de Mayerne’s “Pictoria,
        sculptoria et quae subalternarum artium,” which is also at least forty
        years later, but the emphasis on how the pigments behave is similar. It
        is also useful for the present-day researcher to read that a comment
        made on the behavior of a pigment in the 1620s is very similar to one
        made in 1580 or so.</p>
    <p>Some of the properties ascribed to pigments or the paint in which they
        are used are expressed in words that are found widely: that a pigment or
        paint has body, for example, or that the color or paint dies, are
        expressions as likely to be found in the Marciana Manuscript or the
        writings of Lebrun or Mayerne as in Ms. Fr. 640. The Marciana
        Manuscript, for example, describes colors as being of two kinds, “one of
        which consists of those which have no body, and which do not conceal the
        colors laid under them,” while Mayerne, who comments regularly about the
        body of pigments or pigments dying under certain circumstances, also
        writes, “The death of colors is when the oil floating on the surface
        dries and forms a skin, which blackens in the air.”<a href="#fn100"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref100"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>100</sup></a> Body usually indicates opacity
        of either pigment or paint. An interesting example is provided by the
        discussion of powdered <em>cristallin</em> glass, which as a powder
        looks white and so as if it has body, i.e., some degree of opacity
        (discussed above). In practice, once it has been added to oil paint, it
        does not: the refractive index of the glass is very similar to that of
        the oil, so it is transparent in oil and provides translucency to the
        paint (fols. <a

    <p>Dying implies an undesirable change: the pigment may fade or change
        color; fol. <a

    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>The paint may also die by darkening, or it
        may “sink” as the oil in the uppermost paint layer sinks down into the
        layer beneath, leaving the top layer with a matte appearance. A remedy
        for this was to apply a varnish to the paint, as described on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/32r/f/32r/tl"><u>32r</u></a>:
        “As soon as the colors of panels are well dried, the Flemish varnish
        them so they do not die any further &amp; remain in that state.” A
        particularly interesting example of dying, also on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/56v/f/56v/tl"><u>56v</u></a>,
        relates to the mixing of colors: “In distemper do not mix your different
        colors together for this makes them die, but use each separately.” In
        this case dying presumably refers to the risk of a mixture of pigments
        giving a subdued color, rather than the pure, bright tone one might
        expect from paint in an aqueous binding medium like distemper.</p>
    <p>The author-practitioner is sufficiently interested in the training of
        painters and the drawing of heads to note down some points (fols <a

        Instructions for drawing heads and faces (and bodies) could be found in
        many books at this time, often illustrated (<i><u>Fig. 24</u></i>); an
        example may be found in Binet’s work, although this is more an
        explanation of different views of the head.<a href="#fn101"

        there was also a context particularly relevant to Toulouse: painting the
        portraits of the eight Toulouse <em>capitouls</em>, the chief
        magistrates of the commune of Toulouse who were elected annually, was a
        privilege given to painters. As the painting of portraits was otherwise
        restricted to the nobility, the honor of having their portraits painted
        thus underlined the civic authority of the <em>capitouls</em>.

    <p>Otherwise the discussion of painting is almost entirely practical. The
        author-practitioner’s comments on brushes, both the coarser
        <em>broisses</em> (made using hogs’ bristles) and the finer
        <em>pinceaulx</em> (made using the hair of smaller animals such as
        squirrels and members of the weasel family), including a description of
        how to make them, are made with a detail rarely found in contemporary
        texts (fols. <a

        describes how to make and apply the paint, not only on prepared panels
        or textile supports, but also on cast metal or modeled artifacts. The
        interest in translucent paint is notable: the only pigments or paint
        where there is any sign of the author-practitioner making a practical
        trial are the transparent pigments dragon’s blood and <em>azur
            d’esmail</em>, smalt. The description of smalt and its properties,
        as well as how to use it, are not found anywhere else in this amount of
        detail at this date; the very similar comments by Van Mander were
        written some twenty years later. The suggestion that
        <em>cristallin</em>, powdered glass, can be used to give a degree of
        translucency to otherwise opaque pigments, as described on fol. <a

        without affecting the hue of the pigment—quite apart from its use as an
        additive to improve the drying of paint—is very rarely mentioned in
        written sources. Perhaps it is in the use of paint to decorate metal
        items, or perhaps painting on glass, that this technique would be
        particularly useful.</p>
    <p>The discussion of painting in Ms. Fr. 640 is a rare example of one that
        is based on practice alone, including the preparation of surfaces and
        the making and application of paint by those who need to use it,
        whatever the intended purpose. In this it is very different from those
        contemporary authors writing more on painting as a liberal art and less
        on the practice; this author is not trying to demonstrate his academic
        credentials. At the same time it does not reproduce the standard
        instructions on painting particular motifs (hair, birds) found in
        earlier works and still appearing in contemporary literature. The
        author-practitioner may not have quite succeeded in writing a practical
        guide for the preparation and use of paint for decorative purposes, such
        as painting glass or cast metal objects—the absence of a logical order
        to the content of the manuscript suggests he had some way to go to
        achieve this. However, the content of the instructions he gives is
        useful and informative, providing a rare practical commentary on late
        sixteenth-century painting practice.</p>

                <p>There were manuscript sources more specifically concerned
                    with painting that did discuss oil painting as well as the
                    more commonly described methods for the illumination of

                <p>The need to make a number of half tones between the light and
                    the dark parts for painting any object, not just shadows, is
                    discussed briefly by Giorgio Vasari in his Introduction on

                    (following the Italian model) had become quite rigidly

                    While this may be because Portugal had strong links to the
                    Netherlands at this time, with many northern artists known
                    to have traveled to or even settled there, there are also
                    scattered examples of copper sulfate greens in other areas
                    of Europe, so it may emerge that they were widely used at
                    that time. They have also been found on polychrome
                    sculpture, so may have been even more common in other
                    branches of the arts. See, for example, Andreas Burmester
                    and Johann Koller, “Der heilige Alexius:

                <p>It has been suggested that the sixteenth-century English
                    <em>sinoper</em> or <em>senaper topias</em> or
                    <em>toppes</em> (and variant spellings) was a lake tending
                    towards orange in color, if <em>topias/toppes</em> refers to
                    topaz, a yellow or orange stone: Harley, <em>Artists’
                        Pigments</em>, 132. If this is so, it is likely to have
                    contained madder dye.<a href="#fnref75"

                <p>In making the pigment, potash alum is added to an alkaline
                    solution of the dye, forming the pigment on a hydrated
                    alumina substrate. This takes place at a pH of about 7
                    (broadly speaking). In the case of cochineal, the
                    precipitate is crimson or bluish-crimson at this point. If
                    too much alum is added (and/or the temperature is too high)
                    a purple precipitate is formed. In solution, the carminic
                    acid molecule dissociates at different points according to
                    the acidity or alkalinity, i.e., pH: see Gianna Favaro et
                    al., “Role of photolytic interactions in photo-aging
                    processes of carminic acid and carminic lake in solution and

                        Transactions</em> 2 (2002), 192–7. It is probably
                    significant from the color point of view that the pH at
                    which one of these dissociation points occurs is close to
                    the pH at which lake formation takes place.<a

                    Lebrun was for an ordinary, not particularly good quality
                    pigment, and it seems that lake pigments sold in this form
                    were of this type. The inventory of the Venetian color

                    the pigment contained either brazilwood or sappanwood,
                    madder, and a trace of, probably, cochineal dyes (Katarina
