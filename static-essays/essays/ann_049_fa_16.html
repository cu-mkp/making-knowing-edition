                reflects the author-practitioner’s wider preoccupation with the
                preservation of flora and fauna for display. In this recipe, he
                provides instructions for drying a particular set of flowers
                with sand and preserving them in vases of vinegar. Through an
                examination of the language of the recipe as well as his uses of
                vinegar, sand, and flowers elsewhere in the manuscript, this
                essay seeks to highlight the author-practitioner's familiarity
                with sand and vinegar as preservative materials and postulates
                that an accumulation of botanical knowledge likely informed his
                attempt to achieve a more lifelike result. Moreover, his
                selection of flowers suggests that he was attuned to the
                cultural meanings of flowers and floral decoration in the late
                sixteenth century. A reconstruction of the recipe demonstrates
                that extensive knowledge of the materials is important not only
                to the outcome but to their handling. The author-practitioner’s
                vague instructions suggest that he was familiar with the
                processes of preservation he describes, further underscoring his
                experience with and interest in preserving organic materials.

    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
    <p>The recipe “Keeping dry flowers in the same state all year” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/120v/f/120v/tl"><u>120v</u></a>)
        is one of many recipes in Ms. Fr. 640 that demonstrates the
        author-practitioner’s preoccupation with the preservation of flora and
        fauna. In this entry, the author-practitioner supplies a set of
        instructions for preserving flowers with sand or vinegar, and he
        dedicates a significant amount of space to the description of these
        materials as the means by which the most lifelike preservation can be
        achieved. The author-practitioner recommends particular flowers for
        preservation in sand and vinegar, for which he may have consulted
        contemporary herbals and texts. Based on the mention of herbals in Ms.
        Fr. 640, and certain phrasings of plant descriptions (e.g., fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/63r/f/63r/tl"><u>63r</u></a>,
        “although it is said to be…”), it is possible that he was part of the
        networks of botanical knowledge exchange in early modern Europe.
        “Keeping dry flowers” may have been informed by his contact with natural
        historians, physicians, apothecaries, and botanists; it may also be the
        result of his own experimentation.</p>
    <p>Through a reconstruction of the recipe, we can better understand the
        author-practitioner’s approach to preservation in the manuscript as a
        whole, such as the importance of the materials used and the freshness of
        the specimens involved. Furthermore, by looking at the availability of
        botanical knowledge, the uses of dried flowers, and the culture of
        floral decoration in sixteenth-century France, we can situate the
        author-practitioner and his interests in the preservation and collection
        of the natural world within a context that extends beyond the workshop
        walls.</p>
    <h2 id="the-recipe">The Recipe</h2>
    <p>From the title and first line on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/120v/f/120v/tl"><u>120v</u></a>,
        the author-practitioner clearly articulates the purpose of the recipe:
        to provide indoor dried floral decoration for “tables, rooms, &amp;
        cabinets” when “winter denies flowers.” In order to select the best
        flowers for decoration, in addition to those possessing the best
        properties for drying, the author-practitioner would have required
        knowledge of the flowers commonly used for such purposes. The recipe
        suggests the following flowers: amaranth (<em>amaranthe</em>), lupines
        (<em>palta lupina</em>), cornflowers (<em>boufains</em>), roses
        (<em>roses</em>), carnations (<em>œillets</em>), marigold
        (<em>soulci</em>), broom (<em>genest</em>), and ranunculus (<em>fleurs
            jaulnes des prés appelés ranunculus</em>). Rembert Dodoens
        (1517–1585) comments in his sixteenth-century herbal that amaranth
        flowers are remarkable in that they “do not lightly fade or decay” if
        they are dried in an oven at “half heat.”<a href="#fn1"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref1"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> John Gerard’s 1597 herbal states
        that “no broths are made well without dried marigolds” because they lend
        a “yellow brilliance to a pot.”<a href="#fn2"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref2"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> These passages show not only that
        these flowers were commonly used for drying, but also that drying
        flowers was not an unusual activity, whether for decoration or for use
        elsewhere. Additionally, <em>De stirpium collectione tabulae</em> by
        Conrad Gessner (1516–1565) features a section on the collection of
        plants in general, which includes descriptions of how to dry different
        flowers and seeds, demonstrating that knowledge of preservation
        techniques was a part of botanical knowledge.<a href="#fn3"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref3"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
    <p>The recipe “Keeping dry flowers” does not include much specific direction
        for drying flowers outside of the setup of the boxes of sand containing
        the flowers; this could indicate that processes of drying flowers in
        sand were commonly known. The author-practitioner simply advises laying
        a thin layer of sand at the bottom of the box and standing the flowers
        up in the container while filling it with more sand. Similarly, on fol.
        <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/145v/f/145v/tl"><u>145v</u></a>
        (“Molding plants and flowers”), he recommends that certain flowers be
        cast from life in a standing position, indicating an approach that
        crossed different domains of preservation.</p>
    <p>By contrast, “Keeping dry flowers” provides detailed information about
        the qualities of the materials to be used, paying particular attention
        to the type of sand best for preserving flowers. The author-practitioner
        recommends “the leanest and driest [sand] you can find,” such as the
        type “goldsmiths use to work enamel, or like that for stampings.” He
        adds four notes on the sides of the main body of the recipe to provide
        more information about the type of sand he regards as ideal for this
        process, recommending that if river sand is used, it must be dried, and
        that “coarse” sand should be avoided because it can weigh down the
        petals and cause the flower to “lose its form.” The author-practitioner
        provides extensive commentary on the types of sand which should and
        should not be used for different recipes elsewhere in the manuscript as
        well.<a href="#fn4"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref4"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
    <p>The recipe also features a brief set of instructions for preserving
        flowers in vinegar. Squeezed in above the title, this part of the recipe
        was likely added after the sections on sand, and is significantly
        shorter. It seems possibly an afterthought of the author-practitioner.
    </p>
    <h2 id="flowers-in-the-manuscript-and-the-recipe">Flowers in the Manuscript
        and the Recipe</h2>
    <p>In order to preserve the appearance of the flowers in the most lifelike
        manner possible, the author-practitioner would have needed to have some
        knowledge about the plants themselves. Elsewhere in the manuscript, he
        demonstrates that he has an understanding of the properties of flowers
        he uses and the methods necessary to cultivate them (see Appendix). He
        includes flowers mainly in recipes concerning lifecasting, medicines, or
        dyeing. In many of these recipes, flowers are used in conjunction with
        sand, spirits, or oil. He also usually notes the particular colors of
        the petals and where the flowers can be found; in two entries, he also
        provides some information regarding cultivation practices.</p>
    <p>Although in some recipes the author-practitioner only makes mention of
        flowers in nonspecific terms, there is some overlap between the
        varieties listed in “Keeping dry flowers” and all other flower-related
        recipes in the manuscript. Of the flowers listed in “Keeping dry
        flowers,” at least six are noted elsewhere: amaranth, broom, marigold,
        rose, carnation, and pansy, the latter four appearing in recipes for
        casting and molding. Only ranunculus and lupine are unique to this
        recipe. Of the eight flowers which appear outside of “Keeping dry
        flowers,” three are tree and shrub flowers,<a href="#fn5"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref5"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> four are wildflowers,<a

           id="fnref7"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
    <p>A survey of sixteenth-century herbals shows that most of the flowers in
        the recipe for “Keeping dry flowers” served medicinal functions in
        addition to their decorative uses. For example, ranunculus plants were
        used as a remedy against “corrupt and evil” growth on the body, such as
        warts, to make them fall away.<a href="#fn8"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref8"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> Also, pansies were known to be
        good for “cleaning the lungs and breast” when boiled, and were “very
        good for fevers.”<a href="#fn9"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref9"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> It is likely that the
        author-practitioner was familiar with one or more of the many herbals
        circulating in print. The herbals of Dodoens and Pietro Andrea Mattioli
        (1501–1577) were widely disseminated in the sixteenth century. Dodoens’s
        herbal, <em>Cruijdeboeck</em>, had been translated into a number of
        vernacular languages, including French, by 1568.<a href="#fn10"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref10"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> Rembert Dodoens’s name appears
        on the beginning pages of Ms. Fr. 640,<a href="#fn11"

           id="fnref11"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> and the name “Mathiol,”
        presumably referring to Pietro Mattioli (latinised Mathiolus), is noted
        in a recipe on fol. 35v.</p>
    <p>The flowers recommended in “Keeping dry flowers” are also all noted in
        various sixteenth-century herbals as having bright colored petals. While
        this would not have been of concern in the processes of casting or
        molding,<a href="#fn12"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref12"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> in indoor decoration, color was
        likely an important characteristic of the flowers chosen to be
        displayed. Five of the flowers highlighted in “Keeping dry flowers” were
        appreciated for their vibrant hues. Ranunculus, which the
        author-practitioner also called the “yellow meadow flower,” is described
        as possessing a “fair yellow color as gold, and shining” in Dodoens’s
        herbal. It continued to be valued for its brilliant color, and many
        nineteenth-century florists considered it to be among “the most
        brilliant and showy and beautiful flowering plants in the world.”<a
           href="#fn13"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref13"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> Marigolds were similarly praised
        for their “bright and shining yellow flowers” which “close at the
        setting of the sun” and “open again at the sun rising.”<a href="#fn14"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref14"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> While the author-practitioner
        highlights the yellow color of ranunculus and marigold plants, lupines
        came in a number of different colors in the sixteenth century, including
        yellow, blue, and a “reddish” color.<a href="#fn15"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref15"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> On fol. <a

        a recipe for scudegrun uses broom flowers boiled in water to create a
        yellow lake pigment, pointing to the desirability of their color for
        painting. Amaranth was noted for its deep crimson color,<a href="#fn16"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref16"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> and pansies produced flowers of
        “three diverse colors, whereas the highest leaves of the most part are
        violet, others of bluish or yellow, with black and yellow freckles along
        the frame.”<a href="#fn17"

           id="fnref17"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
    <p>Four of these flowers are also specifically described in contemporary
        herbals as having strong stems which do not bend easily. Dodoens’s
        herbal names lupines as having “hard stems,”<a href="#fn18"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref18"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> and the English term for the
        broom plant derives from the use of the plant’s branches for sweeping in
        the fifteenth century, imparting a sense of how sturdy the stems are.<a
           href="#fn19"

           id="fnref19"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a> Stalk strength may have been

    <h2 id="culture-and-cultivation-of-flowers-knowledge">Culture and
        Cultivation of Flowers: Knowledge</h2>
    <p>Increased activity in botanical study in the sixteenth century could have
        contributed to the author-practitioner’s knowledge about plants and
        flowers as well. In addition to the widely disseminated herbals
        mentioned earlier, scholars and practitioners of all sorts exchanged
        information through letters, pressed flower books, and whole flowers
        shipped from around the world.<a href="#fn20"

           id="fnref20"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> As Florike Egmond has pointed
        out, “natural history research was in nearly every respect a collective
        enterprise in which men (and a few women) cooperated who belonged to

        institutional spheres, ranging from courts to urban guilds and from
        universities to international trading houses.”<a href="#fn21"

    <p>Dried flowers played a role in these networks of exchange as well.
        Naturalists, physicians and apothecaries created collections of dried
        plants, both local and exotic, which they kept between the pages of
        bound volumes, called herbaria, and they could turn to such collections
        year-round to study the plants.<a href="#fn26"

           id="fnref26"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a> Herbaria were sometimes called

           role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a> and they allowed students of
        botany to examine pressed plants and flowers out of season or from
        distant locales. Herbaria also served as a record of the common and

        bear in mind that the herbarium also provided a distorted image of the
        flower by flattening the three-dimensional object. The recipe for drying
        flowers in Ms. Fr. 640 is therefore notable for its ability to preserve
        flowers in their “same state” and form.</p>
    <h2 id="culture-and-cultivation-of-flowers-decoration">Culture and
        Cultivation of Flowers: Decoration</h2>
    <p>By the end of the sixteenth century, the increasing exchange of plants
        and botanical knowledge across the continent led to new uses of flowers
        by early modern Europeans. People increasingly used cut flowers in home
        floral arrangements, and the cultivated gardens of affluent merchants
        and aristocrats displayed collections of new and exotic plants. The
        choice of flowers may have been influenced by the symbolic meanings
        ascribed to particular species. On this point, some of the flowers
        listed in “Keeping dry flowers” held such cultural significance.
        Pansies, for example, take their name from the French noun,
        <em>pensée,</em> meaning “thoughts,” and, as such, the pansy symbolizes
        remembrance. In a renowned invocation of this meaning, the character of
        Ophelia in <em>Hamlet</em> gifts Laertes with a bloom and remarks,
        “Here’s pansies, that’s for thoughts” (4.5.56). The term
        <em>amaranth</em> referred to an imaginary flower that never dies; for
        this reason, the flower has been used to represent immortality.<a

    <p>Representations of flowers, as metal castings or in paintings, were
        valued at this time. As noted above, many of the recipes in Ms. Fr. 640
        that feature flowers are recipes for ornamental objects such as
        lifecasts. The <em>Jeux Floraux</em> (Floral Games) in Toulouse—an
        annual literary competition—offered winners of the poetic prizes casts
        of metal flowers, which included wild roses and marigolds.<a

        examine the blooms to create their still life artworks year-round.</p>
    <p>Cut flower arrangements of the kind featured in still life paintings and
        increasingly in home decoration were new in the sixteenth century. In
        previous centuries, cut flowers had been incorporated into religious
        ceremonies in the form of garlands and crowns, but by the end of the
        sixteenth century, bouquets began to take their place in these rituals
        and ceremonies, and in adorning church walls and banquet tables.<a

        banquets, and bouquets were also presented as gifts, according to an
        early historical study of the gardeners’ guild of Paris (established
        1473).<a href="#fn38"

    <p>At the turn of the seventeenth century, the collection and study of

    <h2 id="preservation-materials-sand-and-vinegar">Preservation Materials:
        Sand and Vinegar</h2>
    <p>The keeping of flowers for decoration as detailed in fol.120r–v is
        achieved through the use of sand or vinegar, two materials the
        author-practitioner invokes repeatedly throughout the manuscript as
        mediums for preservation. His attention to the varieties and properties
        of these materials suggests his deep familiarity with their behavior and
        uses.</p>
    <p>The author-practitioner devotes much of “Keeping dry flowers” to
        describing the type of sand required for drying flowers. As mentioned
        above, the sand should be lean and dry, fine grained, but not dusty; he
        explicitly likens it to the type of sand that goldsmiths use when
        sanding enamel. On fol. 121r, he writes that the sand should “weigh
        down” the plant and help it to keep its form as it dries. Throughout the
        manuscript, sand is often used as a material in casting and molding to
        hold the shape of objects being cast, and the author-practitioner
        includes detailed instructions for the type of sand that should be used
        for this purpose. He believes that using fine sand works best on
        delicate objects such as flowers. In “Sand forflowers” (fol. 160r), he
        writes that the sand used to mold a flower for casting should not be too
        thick or the flowers will be crushed; this is in line with his call for
        “lean” (dry and crumbly),<a href="#fn50"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref50"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>50</sup></a> fine-grained sand in this recipe
        as well.<a href="#fn51"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref51"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>51</sup></a> However, he also warns that the
        sand used to dry flowers should not be too “dusty,” or it will not come
        off the petals. This would have only been an issue in a recipe such as
        this one, where the flowers were removed from the sand; in casting,
        there would have been no need to ensure the sand did not stick to the
        petals.</p>
    <p>The section of the recipe devoted to keeping flowers in vinegar is much
        shorter than that for sand. It is perhaps an afterthought or the result
        of experience: the instructions for this method are squeezed in the
        margin and above the title, below the recipe for silver which precedes
        it. In further marginal notes, the author-practitioner records that
        distilled vinegar works best for preserving blooms. Distilled vinegar
        could have referred to vinegar that was purely acetic acid and water,
        without the vegetable acids and other additives common in household
        vinegars.<a href="#fn52"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref52"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>52</sup></a> The most common process of
        making vinegar was the slow-process Orléans method. This method was
        first developed in Orléans, France, in the late fourteenth century by a
        guild dedicated to researching the best processes for making vinegar.
        The process is still in use today, and involves the continuous slow
        fermentation of wine in wooden casks.<a href="#fn53"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref53"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>53</sup></a> Today, this method typically

           role="doc-noteref"><sup>54</sup></a></p>
    <p>The manuscript also includes a number of uses for vinegar and its
        progenitor, wine, including for preservation. Vinegar is specifically
        mentioned in Ms. Fr. 640 as a material to preserve animals, plants and
        even oneself,<a href="#fn55"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref55"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>55</sup></a> and on fol. 117r, the
        author-practitioner recommends that when carrying flowers which need to
        remain fresh for casting from life, one may “soak their stems in a
        bottle of water, or better still wine.” He thus recognized that wine
        possessed a preservative quality. However, the author-practitioner also
        had first-hand experience with vinegar sometimes causing discoloration
        in flower petals. On fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/63r/f/63r/tl"><u>63r</u></a>,
        in the recipe “Amaranth color,” he warns readers that “white wine
        removes its tint &amp; turns claret-colored, &amp; the dry flower ends
        up white.”</p>
    <h2 id="recipe-reconstruction">Recipe Reconstruction</h2>
    <p>In following the author-practitioner’s recipe for keeping flowers, I
        decided on three trials for both the sand and the vinegar methods, using
        three types of organic flowers.</p>
    <p>Because this reconstruction was done in early winter, the flowers listed
        in the manuscript were out of season, and I instead used delphiniums and
        larkspur, in addition to a set of roses (<i><u>Fig. 1</u></i>).
        Delphiniums and larkspur are both in the ranunculus family. Delphiniums
        also feature tufts of blooms similar to amaranth and ranunculus flowers,
        and larkspur bear smaller flowers whose petals are morphologically
        similar to sixteenth-century pansies. I chose the roses specifically to
        test the effect of vinegar on their preservation, as the
        author-practitioner notes that the “residue of common vinegar makes them
        rot.”</p>

    <p>In testing the sand method, I set up three tall wooden boxes, and
        assigned a different variety of sand to each box (<i><u>Fig. 2</u></i>).
        I used beach sand collected from the Jersey Shore, commercial play sand,
        and refined quartz powder to approximate the different types of sand
        mentioned in the recipe, paying special attention to the coarseness of
        the sand grains (<i><u>Fig. 3</u></i>). Each box with its different sand
        contained one of each type of flower. The author-practitioner specified
        that the flowers be placed in the boxes “so that the flower touches
        neither the bottom nor the sides of the box, but remains in the air,”
        and that the sand be filled up around the flowers and sprinkled on the
        top (<i><u>Fig. 4</u></i>). Because his instructions on this aspect of
        the recipe were not explicit, I devised a method of pouring sand against
        the walls of the boxes in order to cover the flowers with sand without
        harming the petals.<a href="#fn56"

    <p>After ten days, the flowers were dug out of the boxes of sand. The recipe
        does not mention of a method of removal, so I used tools such as spoons
        and small bowls to extricate the sand from around the blooms in order to
        delicately withdraw them (<i><u>Fig. 6</u></i>). After removal, the
        larkspurs and delphiniums retained much of their color and were
        remarkably lifelike. In particular, the dried larkspur were the most
        similar to their original color and shape prior to drying (<i><u>Fig.
                7</u></i>). However, the color of the roses placed in the sand
        became visibly darker, a deep maroon instead of a bright red, and the
        point at which the stem meets the bloom appeared pinched (<i><u>Fig.

                flowers, a brush is used to remove sand from the petals of a

    <p>As the flowers were removed from the boxes of sand, however, the
        delphiniums lost a number of petals, particularly those buried the beach
        and play sand. The delphinium from the box of quartz sand lost
        comparably fewer clusters of petals, based on before and after
        photographs of the flowers. It is possible that the author-practitioner
        favored finer-grained sand because it does not shift as easily. Not only
        was it easier to bury the flowers evenly in the quartz powder, but as
        the flowers were being removed, the fine quartz sand stayed in place and
        continued to support the bloom. The coarser beach and play sands shifted
        easily, and it seemed that the weight of the grains often made the
        petals of the delphiniums break off in the process of extraction. It is
        also important to note that the flowers placed in each sand box were not
        at peak bloom: when placed in the boxes, most had begun to wilt and lose
        petals, and this could have determined how easily the petals broke.</p>
    <p>My reconstruction of the recipe for drying the flowers in sand leads me
        to a number of speculative hypotheses about the author-practitioner’s
        recommendations for sand and flowers. It is probable that
        author-practitioner favored smaller-grained, dry sand because it was
        less likely to crush the petals of the buried flowers. The fine quartz
        powder we used produced the best results with the larkspur, and the
        delphinium in this box lost fewer petals than in the other sand
        varieties.<a href="#fn57"

           id="fnref57"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>57</sup></a></p>
    <p>The color of the delphiniums and larkspurs in all three boxes was still
        fairly vibrant, so it may be the properties of the flowers themselves
        that make them better for drying and maintaining their lifelikeness, not
        the material they are dried in. The author-practitioner’s selection of
        certain blooms over others might be evidence of his botanical knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>To test the vinegar method with both distilled vinegar and “common
        vinegar,” I used 99% pure acetic acid diluted with distilled water to 7%
        and also 50% (hereafter 7V and 50V, respectively), and apple cider
        vinegar with a live mother (hereafter ACV), poured into one-quart mason
        jars. Because the recipe is unclear as to how much vinegar should be
        placed in the sealed vessel with the blooms, I set up two trials for
        each type of vinegar: one in which the flowers were partially submerged
        (only the stems sat in the vinegar), and one in which the flowers were
        fully submerged. In submerging the flowers completely, we placed a piece
        of parafilm inside the jar at the height of the liquid to ensure that
        the flowers stayed under the vinegar. All mason jars were covered with
        two layers of parafilm and plastic tops to keep them “well sealed,” as
        specified by the author-practitioner. The vinegar trials were monitored
        every couple of days.</p>
    <p>Even after only twenty minutes of submersion, however, it was clear that
        the vinegar had an effect on the color of the petals. The delphinium
        placed in 50V immediately began to leach color into the clear solution,
        turning it slightly pink. It was possible to see the stream of color
        coming out of the petals. This recalls the author-practitioner’s warning
        on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/63r/f/63r/tl"><u>63r</u></a>
        regarding the discoloration of the amaranth flower after the application
        of white wine on the petals. After a week, the petals of both the
        delphinium and larkspur in the 50V jar were translucent (<i><u>Fig.
                9</u></i>).</p>

    <p>All three flowers in all three types of vinegar began to wilt slightly
        after one day, and after a week, the delphiniums in the 7V and 50V
        partial submersions had lost all of their petals. It is possible that
        this was the result of the less-than-optimal freshness of the flowers
        when they were placed in the jars. The flowers used in this experiment
        had been picked five days earlier, but the author-practitioner
        recommends that they be used when at their peak, “when they are n full
        vigor &amp; growing.” Because the flowers used in our experiment were no
        longer in “full vigor” this may have had an effect on the outcome. The
        flowers in 7V and 50V also began to slump in the jars; their stems were
        no longer as robust as they were on their first day. The flowers in ACV
        did not droop as much (<i><u>Fig. 10</u></i>).</p>

    <p>It is also interesting to note that the delphinium and larkspur flowers
        placed in the ACV retained the color in their petals for longer than
        those placed in 7V and 50V. It was possible to see droplets forming on
        the petals of the flowers in partial submersion in all three types of
        vinegar—droplets which ran down the sides of the jar where the petals
        touched the glass and led to a light pink coloration in the acetic
        acid—but this seemed to have the least effect on those flowers in the
        ACV.<a href="#fn58"

    <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>In “Keeping dry flowers in the same state all year,” the
        author-practitioner demonstrates his expertise in preservation and
        reveals his place in the exchange networks of botanical information in
        early modern Europe. His understanding of the properties of the
        materials involved in the process of preserving organic materials is
        extensive, as suggested by the many different methods he compiles and
        experiments with throughout the manuscript. His additional marginal
        notes in this recipe regarding sand varieties and properties also
        suggests that he tried this process more than once, as in order to
        achieve the most lifelike results possible, he would have had to
        determine which flowers were more amenable to drying and to experiment
        with different methods of preservation.</p>
    <p>Many of the details in this recipe were not made explicit by the
        author-practitioner; as a result, there are a number of other avenues
        for further research. There are five other variables which could be
        tested: time, flower type, water’s ability to keep flowers alive as
        opposed to vinegar, the effect of water on dried plants, and how the
        flowers are sealed. We chose to take the flowers out of the boxes of
        sand after ten days, but the author-practitioner does not specify the
        amount of time (he only writes “several days”). It would be beneficial
        to test the amount of drying time required to achieve the most durable
        result. Also, further experimentation could include the flower types the
        author-practitioner specifically lists in the recipe in order to get as
        close to the original process as possible and to see if these flowers do
        keep their color and the appearance of vitality. Third, the vinegar
        method included in this recipe is the least detailed, and therefore has
        more scope for interpretation. For this reason, it would be good to test
        each of the vinegars against a control of plain water. Fourth, Carolus
        Clusius is known to have dipped dried flowers in water in order to
        “revive” and study them;<a href="#fn59"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref59"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>59</sup></a> it would be interesting to see
        if flowers that did not retain their color or vibrancy through drying
        could be restored after being submerged in water. Perhaps Clusius’s
        dried flowers were soaked in water before they were displayed. Finally,
        the author-practitioner does not make it clear how the flowers should be
        sealed. We tested sealing the flowers inside the jar completely, but it
        is also possible that the author-practitioner meant for only the stems
        to be sealed in and the blooms left open to the air.</p>
    <p>The lack of a definitive set of instructions may have resulted from
        author-practitioner’s familiarity with the processes, which further
        underscores his experience with and interest in preserving organic
        materials (<i><u>Fig. 11</u></i>).</p>

                <p>Drying flowers in sand is a method still commonly used today.
                    Oolitic sand (sediment made of small, coated grains of
                    limestone) is the preferred sand type used by preservers, as
                    it has a small grain size which will prevent extensive
                    damage to the flower petals, seemingly similar to the
                    goldsmiths’ sand that the author-practitioner mentions in

                    Life casters would drown specimens in jars of vinegar prior
                    to casting them. See Hannah Rose Shell, “Ceramic Nature,” in

                    author-practitioner describes such practices in his
                    manuscript. On fol. 109v, he recommends placing snakes and
                    lizards in a bottle of “good vinegar” in order to kill them
                    for molding. On fol. 112r, “Putting to death the animal for
                    molding,” he describes force feeding animals “some good
                    eau-de-vie or else mix a little with the vinegar” to kill
                    them. The manuscript also includes a number of recipes which
