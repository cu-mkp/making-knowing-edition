        <div>
            <p>This essay explores the author-practitioner’s knowledge of tin.
                It compares the discussion of tin and its properties in Ms. Fr.
                640 to those found in contemporary works, such as Georgius
                Agricola’s <em>De re metallica</em>, Vannoccio Biringuccio’s
                <em>Pirotechnia</em>, and Lazarus Ercker’s <em>Beschreibung
                    allerfürnemisten mineralischen Ertzt und
                    Berckwercksarten</em>. Of particular interest are the
                author-practitioner’s qualifiers for tin, which include
                <em>doux</em>, <em>fin</em>, and <em>aigre</em>. A historical
                reconstruction of a recipe on fol. <a

                for creating tin ornaments considers the author-practitioner’s
                tacit knowledge about metalworking and the social context for
                decorative tin objects.</p>

    <p>Metals of various sorts play an essential role in many of the recipes in
        BnF Ms. Fr. 640. In particular, tin is one of the most frequently used
        metals throughout the manuscript, with the author-practitioner often
        relying on several different tin-lead alloys in various recipes for
        casting in particular. More exactly, tin is referred to 287 times
        throughout the manuscript; lead is referred to slightly less frequently
        at 281 times, while iron is referred to 231 times, and copper is
        referred to only 135 times. Although tin could be mined in only a few
        locations throughout Europe, it was widely used at the time of the
        manuscript’s writing, corroborated by the strong presence of tin in the
        manuscript. This practical ubiquity was perhaps even more true of tin
        when it was alloyed with lead or copper in order to make pewter for
        tableware and bronze for bells, organ pipes, sculptures, and many other
        common items, a fact toward which the author sometimes gestures when he
        notes that a particular recipe calls for tin that has not been used for
        any other purpose previously.<a href="#fn1"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref1"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> In his focus on metals, the
        author-practitioner’s work coincides with a new development and
        dissemination of knowledge about tin and other metals that had begun
        around the midpoint of the sixteenth century and that was reflected in
        learned works as Georgius Agricola’s <em>De re metallica</em> (1556). At
        the same time, the author-practitioner’s treatment of tin and other
        metals is unusual when compared to these other works.</p>
    <p>One of the most intriguing, and at first sight puzzling, aspects of the
        use of tin in the manuscript is the wide range of adjectives the
        author-practitioner uses to qualify the metal. For instance, the
        author-practitioner at various times recommends the use of <em>estain de
            glace</em> (looking glass tin) as well as tin that is either
        <em>fin</em> (fine), <em>aigre</em> (brittle), or <em>doux</em>
        (soft/sweet), frequently without providing further explanation.
        Clarifying the different qualities of tin is essential to understanding
        and reconstructing many of the recipes found in Ms. Fr. 640. On fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/6v/f/6v/tl"><u>6v</u></a>,
        for example, a recipe for stamping tin ornaments to be used as household
        furniture decoration relies on the special qualities of <em>doux</em>
        tin at several points. Situating this use of <em>doux</em> tin within a
        broader context of other uses of tin both throughout Ms. Fr. 640 and in
        similar texts produced during the period gives insight into the
        author-practitioner’s knowledge and employment of metals and his
        relationship to early modern discourses on metalworking. Furthermore, an
        investigation of the meaning behind terms such as <em>doux</em> speaks
        to the question of the author-practitioner’s tacit knowledge, an issue
        relevant for the entries throughout Ms. Fr. 640.</p>
    <p>This essay will begin by examining early modern texts on metalworking and
        their discussions of tin. It will consider the author-practitioner’s
        approach to working with tin in Ms. Fr. 640, focusing on the advantages
        and disadvantages he describes of various qualities of tin and
        speculating about their identities. As the author-practitioner
        frequently links tin with lead due to the useful alloys the two metals
        produce, a portion of the essay will focus on the various qualities of
        lead used in the manuscript and the ways those qualities differ from and
        complement those of tin. Finally, the essay will describe attempts to
        reconstruct a recipe found on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/6v/f/6v/tl"><u>6v</u></a>
        for easily creating tin ornaments; since this recipe appears to depend
        upon the unique qualities of <em>doux</em> tin, it gives insight into
        the qualities and identity of this particular metal. Further insights
        into the qualities of <em>doux</em> tin are gleaned from a subsequent
        recipe on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/7r/f/7r/tl"><u>7r</u></a>
        that provides directions for creating a gold paint to decorate the tin
        ornaments created in the preceding recipe. Together, these two recipes
        point to the author-practitioner’s interest in imitating the look of
        rarer or more expensive materials by the artistic exploitation of more
        common materials. It also suggests something about the broader social
        situation in which the author-practitioner was writing and perhaps the
        goals that he assumed his readers would have in mind in attempting his
        recipes.</p>
    <p>Although tin was used throughout early modern Europe in a broad range of
        applications, there were only three major sources of European tin:
        northwestern Iberia, southern Germany, and southwestern England, with
        the latter tending to have the strongest hold on western European
        markets.<a href="#fn2"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref2"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> In fact, the author-practitioner
        himself discusses the differences between English and German tin on fol.
        <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/139r/f/139r/tl"><u>139r</u></a>,
        claiming that English tin is extremely hard and thus is frequently
        alloyed with lead by English miners soon after being mined. In contrast,
        German tin tends to be much softer and apparently does not need to be
        alloyed before being sold and put to use. Despite the
        author-practitioner’s presence in Toulouse, he does not speak of Iberian
        tin. In any case, it is clear that the author-practitioner was aware of
        the sources of his metal and took account of how the qualities of metals
        from different sources might affect their use. Additionally, his comment
        about English tin being mixed with lead serves as a reminder that metals
        in the early modern world were not always as pure as modern readers
        might assume, and that purity was, perhaps, not considered as essential
        to the identity of a metal as the qualities it exhibited in use. After
        all, despite English tin being mixed with lead, the author-practitioner
        nevertheless refers to it as tin.</p>
    <p>The author-practitioner of Ms. Fr. 640 was certainly not the first
        individual in early modern Europe to commit his knowledge of metals and
        metalworking to writing. In the middle of the sixteenth century, three
        major authors contributed to the scholarly awareness and systematization
        of knowledge about metalworking: Vannoccio Biringuccio (1480–1539),
        Georgius Agricola (1495–1555), and Lazarus Ercker (1528–1594).
        Agricola’s <em>De re metallica</em> in particular treats the unique
        qualities of tin as well as the tin mining process, as do Biringuccio’s
        somewhat earlier <em>Pirotechnia</em> (1540) and Ercker’s somewhat later
        <em>Beschreibung aller fürnemisten mineralischen Ertzt und
            Bergwercksarten</em> (1574).<a href="#fn3"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref3"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> All three texts, considered
        foundational works of early modern metallurgy, reflect the development
        of an alleged “proto-industrial” revolution of the sixteenth century,
        which resulted in rapid progress in the fields of both mining and
        metallurgy; they suggest a new interest among educated audiences in
        understanding the knowledge and practices of miners and others who
        worked with metals.<a href="#fn4"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref4"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
    <p>The works of Biringuccio, Agricola, and Ercker reveal important aspects
        of early modern conceptions of tin. Biringuccio, for instance, notes
        both the easy availability of tin and the fact that it melts at a
        relatively low temperature, making it a much easier material to work
        with than other metals. Moreover, he writes, “this metal, either pure or
        when mixed with lead, stands up well under the hammer, so that if
        desired, it can be spread out thinner than paper.”<a href="#fn5"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref5"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> Here, one sees two important
        qualities of tin that are also given in Ms. Fr. 640. First, tin is noted
        to be relatively soft and malleable, allowing one to manipulate it with
        a hammer. Second, it can be made into extremely thin sheets. As will be
        shown below, this second quality is especially important for the
        author-practitioner’s use of tin for household decorations.</p>
    <p>Agricola also focuses on the softness of tin, noting that tin which
        cracks when struck with a hammer contains too many impurities and must
        be melted down again.<a href="#fn6"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref6"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> The ease with which one could
        manipulate tin—the relatively low heat needed to smelt it and the way it
        could be bent or hammered until extremely thin—was an important quality
        for Agricola and the author-practitioner of Ms. Fr. 640. Intriguingly,
        while Agricola does mention the special methods used to smelt tin in
        Iberia,<a href="#fn7"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref7"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> he does not include references to
        the different qualities of tin from different sources such as England
        and Germany, as does the author-practitioner. Agricola and Biringuccio
        appear more concerned with describing the processes related to mining,
        assaying, and smelting rather than the small-scale, particular
        manipulation discussed in Ms Fr. 640.</p>
    <p>Like Biringuccio and Agricola, Ercker focuses primarily upon the
        processes of mining and assaying tin, noting the relatively low melting
        point of tin when compared to other metals.<a href="#fn8"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref8"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> Notably, Ercker’s discussion of
        tin evinces an abiding concern with ensuring that tin is pure. For
        instance, he describes a method for determining whether tin is alloyed
        or otherwise contains admixture by comparing the weight of a sample of
        the tin with that of a ball of tin known to be pure. However, he does
        note that this method assumes that both tin samples have been taken from
        the same mine, since tin from different mines does not have the same
        weight, even if equal in purity.<a href="#fn9"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref9"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> This concern for the sourcing of
        metals, though not as detailed as the author-practitioner’s, is absent
        from Agricola and Biringuccio. Accordingly, it seems that the
        author-practitioner is concerned primarily with using his materials in
        order to produce useful, decorative, or curious objects, while authors
        such as Agricola, Biringuccio, and Ercker are more interested in
        providing a systematic overview of the knowledge and processes used in
        working with metals, including mining, assaying, and smelting.</p>
    <p>The author-practitioner’s practical text leads him to employ a variety of
        different tins throughout the manuscript. On fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/5r/f/5r/tl"><u>5r</u></a>,
        for instance, he includes a recipe for steel mirrors that involves the
        use of “soft [<em>doux</em>] tin, that is to say fine [<em>fin</em>],
        which has not yet been used.” In other words, <em>fin</em> tin is that
        which has not been melted down and recycled after having been used for
        some other application in the past. The identity of <em>doux</em> tin is
        less straightforward. The author-practitioner frequently uses
        <em>doux</em> in contrast to <em>aigre</em>.<a href="#fn10"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref10"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> While these terms sometimes seem
        to indicate the properties of sweetness and sourness, they at other
        times seem to point to softness and brittleness. The qualities of
        softness and fineness are attributed to tin and other metals in various
        places throughout the manuscript. In particular, as noted above, they
        are frequently contrasted with the opposing qualities of brittle tin. As
        the author-practitioner notes on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/48v/f/48v/tl"><u>48v</u></a>,
        “There is fine &amp; soft tin &amp; brittle tin [<em>estaim fin &amp;
            doulx &amp; estaim aigre</em>]. … Soft [<em>doulx</em>] tin is more
        even than the brittle one, which is whiter and seems to be burnished
        like a mirror.” In a subsequent entry on “Pewterers” on the following
        page, fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/49r/f/49r/tl"><u>49r</u></a>,
        he again suggests that “there are two kinds of tin, one of them nearly
        like lead, which runs better, the other brittle [<em>aigre</em>], which
        becomes thicker.” If <em>doux</em> tin is malleable and adequate for use
        in various tasks, <em>aigre</em> tin can be much more troublesome to
        work with. As the author-practitioner continues, “brittle
        [<em>aigre</em>] tin is found mixed into <em>saulmons</em>, easy to cut,
        but difficult to put to use &amp; melt if it is not mixed with the other
        soft [<em>doulx</em>] one. And without this, it would become waste.”<a
           href="#fn11"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref11"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> In other words, brittle tin is
        useful only when mixed with either soft tin or lead and is more or less
        useless on its own.</p>
    <p>As to the identity of this brittle tin, the author-practitioner gives
        modern readers a possible clue on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/48v/f/48v/tl"><u>48v</u></a>,
        where he notes that both tin and lead “become brittle
        [<em>sesgrissent</em>] having been put back to melt often or for a long
        time, and they thicken and burn, in such a way that even when one melts
        a <em>saulmon</em>, the tin thickens at the bottom if, while casting,
        one does not stir it often.” Perhaps, then, brittle tin was simply tin
        that had been melted down repeatedly as craftsmen used it for any number
        of purposes. Over time, it would lose much of its malleability and
        softness, becoming too brittle to be used without admixture or alloying.
        Indeed, modern work with tin and tin-based alloys shows that tin
        subjected to repeated cycles of heating and cooling will begin to
        develop cracks, making it less suitable for use.<a href="#fn12"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref12"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> Such an identity for brittle
        [<em>aigre</em>] tin fits well with the recipe on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/5r/f/5r/tl"><u>5r</u></a>,
        quoted above, in which the author-practitioner suggests that its
        opposite, soft [<em>doux</em>] tin, is also called “fine, which has not
        yet been used.” In other words, fine [<em>fin</em>] tin appears to be
        that which had not previously been melted and would therefore have
        retained more of its malleability and softness, while brittle tin seems
        to have been that which had already been put to use and was then melted
        down again for reuse, repeatedly, until it became brittle and began to
        melt less easily. Given the ambiguity surrounding the use of these terms
        in the manuscript, however, this identification can remain only
        tentative.</p>
    <p>The author-practitioner seems to have had a thorough knowledge of
        lead-tin alloys and the qualities one could expect from various
        mixtures, especially for use in casting. As he notes on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/84v/f/84v/tl"><u>84v</u></a>,
        “for casting, there is only soft [<em>doux</em>] lead that wants to be
        cast very hot, and soft [<em>douls</em>] tin.” However, the
        author-practitioner does not simply use these metals in their original
        form but rather frequently advises readers to alloy them in various
        ratios in order to achieve better results. For instance, on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/110v/f/110v/tl"><u>110v</u></a>,
        which features a recipe for making metal lifecasts of plants and
        animals, the author-practitioner notes, “if your medal, plant, or other
        thing for molding is thin &amp; fine, do it so that there is more tin,
        much more than lead, namely less than the fourth part lead for three
        parts tin. And still, one puts lead only to form an alloy. On the
        contrary, if you want to mold something strong &amp; thick, put a lot
        more lead in than tin.” Even just a small amount of another metal, then,
        could produce more desirable qualities. The author-practitioner also
        makes clear that his alloy ratios result from his own experimentation.
        Further down the page, in lines that seem to have been added later, he
        remarks, “since then, when molding with fine and new lead, I put into
        one lb two ounces of fine tin. And when molding with fine tin, I put in
        two ounces of fine lead for one pound.” As a result, he boasts, “I made
        plants &amp; snakes just like nature.”</p>
    <p>Aside from casting, the author-practitioner also makes use of tin for the
        purpose of decorating household furniture. An example is located on fol.
        <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/6v/f/6v/tl"><u>6v</u></a>
        in a recipe for creating tin ornaments that can be used to embellish
        mirrors, chests, bed valances, and other items.<a href="#fn13"

           role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> To easily create these ornaments
        in multiples, a design is first etched into a piece of iron or copper.
        Then, soft [<em>doux</em>] tin is poured onto a piece of marble, and a
        wooden board or a roll-press is used to flatten the tin into a thin
        sheet. Once this is done, the tin is placed over the etched iron or
        copper, with a piece of felt over both, and then struck with a hammer in
        order to transfer the etched design to the tin sheet. This process seems
        designed to take advantage of the capacity of tin to be made extremely
        thin and malleable enough to allow the transfer of a design onto it by
        means of hammer blows.</p>
    <p>Reconstructions of this recipe have shown that such a mechanical image
        transfer is feasible, although the author-practitioner’s recommendations
        as written appear insufficient to produce the desired result.<a

           role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> Pure tin ingots were chosen as
        the <em>doux</em> tin for being unalloyed and unused. Initial attempts
        to melt down the tin, pour it out onto a slab of marble, and flatten it
        out with a board showed that the tin cooled and solidified before a
        board could be used to flatten it into as thin a sheet as the recipe
        suggests necessary (<i><u>Fig. 1</u></i>). Moreover, the solidified tin
        was not smooth but featured various irregularities, giving it a rough
        texture and making it, at least apparently, unsuitable for use as the
        material for an ornament. This experience perhaps suggests that the
        <em>doux</em> tin called for in the recipe is in fact not identical with
        pure tin. However, given that the author-practitioner suggests using
        this method or putting the tin through a roller-press, it is possible
        that the roller-press would have produced better results.</p>

    <p>Moreover, attempts to transfer a design from an etched copper plate to
        the tin using a rubber mallet were unsuccessful, resulting in the
        transfer of only small traces of the design (<i><u>Fig. 2</u></i>). A
        standard metal carpenter’s hammer, however, proved to be more
        successful, providing the extra force needed to at least achieve proof
        of concept. Even so, the tin remained too thick and uneven to obviously
        be of use as an ornament. Taking direction from Biringuccio’s
        <em>Pirotechnia</em>, attempts were made to resolve this issue by
        pounding out the tin with a hammer before transferring the design.<a

           role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> The tin did indeed prove to be
        quite malleable, thinning out considerably within a relatively short
        span of hammering (<i><u>Fig. 3</u></i>). Moreover, the thinner tin
        seemed to pick up the etched design better than did the thicker tin (<i><u>Fig. 4</u></i>). In short, while it does seem possible to create
        something like that which the author-practitioner had in mind, doing so
        seems to require a greater degree of effort or skill than he
        articulated. Given his evident familiarity with metalworking, these gaps
        in the recipe perhaps suggest that he had never attempted this recipe
        himself, that he was only repeating information that he had gained
        elsewhere, or that he simply assumed that certain parts of the recipe,
        which had to be inferred during attempts to recreate it, would have been
        obvious to anyone with the means and inclination to actually create his
        tin ornaments.</p>

    <p>Intriguingly, the next entry in the manuscript (on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/7r/f/7r/tl"><u>7r</u></a>)
        offers advice on how to gild and mount the tin ornaments created by
        following the recipe on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/6v/f/6v/tl"><u>6v</u></a>.
        Included in this subsequent recipe is advice for making an adhesive as
        well as for creating a gold pigment to be painted on or placed over the
        tin ornament depending on the materials one had to hand. The result,
        according to the author-practitioner, is that “it will be beautiful like
        fine gold.” In other words, the intention behind these two recipes, when
        taken together, is not merely to create pleasant decorations for one’s
        furniture, but also, perhaps, to imitate more expensive, delicately
        carved furniture decorated with gold leaf. This aspect of the recipe
        provides insight into the manuscript itself as well as broader social
        conditions. The author-practitioner’s use of art to mimic the properties
        of materials that would have been more difficult or expensive to
        acquire, such as gold leaf, suggests the interest among artists and
        presumably their patrons as well in the value of imitation, even in the
        context of household furniture. Although individuals who could acquire
        embellished tin ornaments like the ones the author-practitioner
        describes already had the means to afford a certain measure of luxury,<a
           href="#fn16"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref16"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> they nevertheless desired to
        imitate the styles and fashions of those even wealthier than themselves.
    </p>
    <p>It is clear that the author-practitioner had a detailed knowledge of
        metals and metalworking. While he was writing in the same period as
        other authors interested in systematizing knowledge of metals and making
        it available to learned readers, his goals differed from theirs in
        important ways. Most obviously, Ms. Fr. 640 exhibits no evidence of
        attempts to systematize metalworking knowledge. Instead, the
        author-practitioner focuses on describing the qualities of tin and other
        metals relevant to his recipes and uses. Moreover, the
        author-practitioner experimented with tin, lead, and other metals in
        order to create alloys that would better serve his purposes. In the case
        examined here, the special properties of tin were exploited to create
        finely detailed ornaments for household furniture. Furthermore, in light
        of subsequent recipes attempting to give these ornaments the appearance
        of gold, it is clear that the author-practitioner had an abiding
        interest in imitating the properties of rarer or more precious materials
        through the ingenuity of art, an interest borne out by other essays
        exploring the manuscript’s entries.<a href="#fn17"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref17"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> At the same time, the apparent
        lack of detail found in recipes like that for tin ornaments on fol. <a

        raises questions about which of the techniques in the manuscript the
        author-practitioner had actually tried, as well as the tacit knowledge
        he possessed, or assumed others would possess, that, although necessary
        for achieving a successful result, he omitted from the recipe.</p>
