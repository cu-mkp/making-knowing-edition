        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <div>
            <p>Of over forty medicinal entries in BnF Ms. Fr. 640, “Medicine of
                the Orientals against all maladies” is the only recipe that
                advises taking in the smoke of a dried herb as a treatment. This
                recipe, on fol. <a
                   href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/77r/f/77r/tl"><u>77r</u></a>,
                is also the only reference to “oriental medicine” in the
                manuscript and the sole example of the use of a pipe to make
                smoke. In other parts of the manuscript, however, the
                author-practitioner includes numerous references to good and bad
                smoke, breath, and vapors in the context of bodily health and
                craft techniques. This essay discusses this recipe's
                relationship to others in Ms. Fr. 640, offering insights into
                the author-practitioner’s conceptions of medicinal materials and
                practices, and the overlap between medical and non-medical
                processes in the manuscript. To further situate “Medicine of the
                orientals against all maladies,” this essay explores its
                possible genealogy within global medicinal practices. These
                interconnections demonstrate the importance of historicizing
                artisanal and medical practice and their related knowledge
                systems.</p>

    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
    <p>Of the over forty medicinal entries in Ms. Fr. 640, “Medicine of the
        orientals against all maladies” is alone in its advice to take in the
        smoke of a dried herb as a treatment. This recipe on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/77r/f/77r/tl"><u>77r</u></a>
        is also the only reference to “oriental medicine” in the manuscript as
        well as the sole example of the use of a pipe to make smoke.<a

        author-practitioner included numerous references to good and bad smoke,
        breath, and vapors in the context of bodily health and craft procedures.
        The recipes in the manuscript show a great deal of overlap between
        medical knowledge and knowledge of other types of practices. Tracing the
        possible genealogy of this specific recipe within a wider tradition of
        global medicinal practices, and discussing its relationship to other
        recipes in Ms. Fr. 640, offers insight into the author-practitioner’s
        conceptions of medicinal materials and practices.<a href="#fn2"

    <blockquote>
        <p>
            <strong>Medicine of the orientals against all maladies</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Dry rosemary in the month of May, then fill this bowl with powder of
            it, and put a lit charcoal on top. And, receive the smoke by a quite
            tightened mouth, and a part will come out by your nose. But if you
            want to purge the head also pinch the nose. Against colds, rheums,
            and other maladies (fol. 77r).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>This recipe appears in a neatly written
        section, with a drawing of a pipe between the heading and the main body
        of the recipe (<i><u>Fig. 1</u></i>) (<i><u>Fig. 2</u></i>). It begins
        with the command to “dry rosemary in the month of May.”<a href="#fn4"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref4"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> Next, the author-practitioner
        instructs the reader to “fill this bowl with powder of it, and put a lit
        charcoal on top.” After filling the bowl of the clay pipe with the
        crushed rosemary and charcoal, he says to “receive the smoke by a quite
        tightened mouth, and a part will come out by your nose. But if you want
        to purge the head also pinch the nose. Against colds, rheums, and other
        maladies.” This recipe tells the reader to bring the smoke into the head
        (not inhale it into the lungs). As is discussed later in this essay,
        pipe-smoking practices in the sixteenth century rarely involved inhaling
        smoke into the lungs. Thus, it is not unusual that the
        author-practitioner calls for bringing the smoke in through the mouth to
        “purge the head.” Clearly, “smoking,” if defined as inhaling into the
        lungs, does not apply in this recipe.<a href="#fn5"

    <h2 id="sixteenth-century-medicine">Sixteenth-century Medicine </h2>
    <p>According to historian Mary Lindemann, early modern perceptions of health
        and illness were shaped by humoral theories of balance as well as
        “ancient ideas of disease as an invasion of the body or as a form of
        pollution.”<a href="#fn6"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref6"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> The writings of Hippocrates (ca.
        450–370 BCE) and Galen of Pergamum (ca. 129–200 CE) viewed disease as
        arising from an environmentally influenced imbalance of the four humors
        (black bile, yellow or red bile, blood, and phlegm).<a href="#fn7"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref7"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> Within this humoral tradition,
        prevention “was as important as treatment” and health was maintained
        through modifying the humors by employing the six non-naturals.<a
           href="#fn8"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref8"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> Lindemann argues that until at
        least the seventeenth century, “a mixture of <em>environmentalism</em>
        and <em>humoralism</em> dominated interpretations of disease” for both
        lay and learned people.<a href="#fn9"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref9"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
    <p>While historian Michael Stolberg acknowledges the presence of concerns
        about balancing bodily humors in the sixteenth century, in his research
        with medical case histories he has found “a very pronounced tendency to
        localise disease processes” and imbalance in specific organs.<a
           href="#fn10"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref10"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> As a consequence, many early
        modern physicians viewed diseases or the causes of disease as
        “accumulations of crude or otherwise morbid, harmful matter,” or
        “fluxes.”<a href="#fn11"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref11"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> During this period, many
        physicians called a common type of flux a “catarrh,” which was
        attributed to “watery, mucous or corrupt matter that had accumulated in
        the head.”<a href="#fn12"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref12"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> Since “rheume” is another term
        for “catarrh,” the author-practitioner is probably referring to the same
        type of ailment on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/77r/f/77r/tl"><u>77r</u></a>.
        The recipe’s instructions to take smoke into the head as a targeted
        treatment, and not breathe it into the lungs, also echoes the common
        sixteenth-century belief that treatments should target the specific
        location of the ailment.</p>
    <p>The idea that an aromatic smoke would be a helpful treatment for colds or
        fluxes can first be contextualized in beliefs about infected air.<a
           href="#fn13"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref13"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> The belief that air could be
        corrected or protected by good smells, especially the smells of aromatic
        herbs like rosemary, led to practices of fumigation for health during
        this period.<a href="#fn14"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref14"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> As mentioned above, the ideas
        about humoral balance during this period resulted in “hot” treatments
        for “cold” ailments. Since rosemary was considered a hot and dry herb,
        it thus makes sense that it was used against head colds, as described on
        fol. 77r.<a href="#fn15"

    <p>In addition to its use in “Medicine of the orientals against all
        maladies,” as part of a treatment to purge the head of “colds, rheums,
        and other maladies,” rosemary appears in three other recipes in the
        manuscript: fol. <a

        “Plants difficult to burn in the <em>noyau</em>.” These recipes show the
        author-practitioner’s knowledge about rosemary as it is grown and as it
        is used as <em>materia medica</em>, and in other processes. On fol. 98r,
        the author-practitioner describes the cultivation of rosemary, advising
        on how to make the holes “with an iron stake, where you will plant your
        rosemary. Behead &amp; cut to measure and prune from the bottom up.”

        panacea was widely acknowledged in European herbals and medicinal
        treatises. An early English herbal, printed anonymously in 1525, calls

    <p>Sources predating and contemporary with Ms. Fr. 640 contain medicinal
        recipes that involve using rosemary as a fumigant. In the Appendix to
        chapter CLXXX of his <em>Great Herbal</em>, Fuchs states that “the later
        physicians say that rosemary as a fumigant eases a cough and dripping
        [noses], and, what is especially noteworthy, when burned it renders the
        house safe during pestilence by its fumes diluting the danger of impure
        air.”<a href="#fn32"

           id="fnref32"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a> Further, Friar Daniel’s

           role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a> In his works, Nicholas Culpeper
        (1616–1654) echoes earlier texts in recommending rosemary for a variety

        fumigants aside from rosemary (such as rue, bitumen, and crushed
        amber).<a href="#fn34"

        and Chambers” to “correcteth the Air in them” and says, “the dried Leavs
        shred smal and taken in a Pipe like as Tobacco is taken, helpeth those

        century.</p>
    <h2 id="rosemary-in-france">Rosemary in France</h2>
    <p>In his herbal, Fuchs asserts that “today [rosemary] is planted everywhere
        in gardens and pots. However, in Narbonne, in France, it grows so
        abundantly that the inhabitants burn no other wood.”<a href="#fn36"

        gardens, and mayntayne it with great diligence.”<a href="#fn37"

        knowledge about the herb circulated in southern France in medicinal and

        Montpellier university had an important “school of botany,” and “most of
        the principal herbals published in other languages appeared in French
        versions quite early in their history.”<a href="#fn39"

        written accounts of its characteristics were not the only reasons for

        relationship between smell and medicine were also important.</p>
    <h2 id="smell-and-smoke-in-medicine">Smell and Smoke in Medicine</h2>
    <p>Smell has played a role in medical thinking since antiquity. Hippocrates,
        in his works <em>Airs, Waters, and Places</em> and <em>Nutriment</em>,
        mentions “bad smells” in the context of disease diagnosis and
        prevention.<a href="#fn40"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref40"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>40</sup></a> Until the work of Conrad Victor
        Schneider (1640–1680) in the later seventeenth century, physicians
        expressed a belief in a porous “breast- or nipple-like” plate
        “separating the nasal and cerebral cavities.”<a href="#fn41"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref41"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>41</sup></a> In <em>The Olfactory Organ</em>,
        Galen argued that the nose “was no more than a passage which carried
        smells up to the true olfactory organ, the brain itself.”<a href="#fn42"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref42"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>42</sup></a> Thus, with no barrier of
        protection, the brain could be affected by both “good” and “bad” smells.
        In addition to the physiognomy of sensory reception, the belief in
        smells as materials themselves contributed to their significance in
        narratives of health.<a href="#fn43"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref43"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>43</sup></a> In his work on smell and health,
        historian Richard Palmer discusses instances in which smells were part
        of treatment for “cold complexions of the brain, for various kinds of
        headache, for catarrh, for melancholy, and for nervous conditions.”<a
           href="#fn44"

    <p>The overlap of ideas about medicine, aromatics, and perfumery present in
        Ms. Fr. 640 thus reflects links between scent and health in the
        sixteenth century. According to Palmer, perfumery was “a trade which
        developed rapidly from the Middle Ages onwards with the development of
        distilling and the extraction of essential or volatile oils.”<a

           id="fnref45"

        and fumigations, scented candles, rose water, aromatic herb and

        the sixteenth century.<a href="#fn46"

           id="fnref46"

        Holly Dugan, “early modern medical authorities recognized perfume as

           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref48"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>48</sup></a> Because it was an inexpensive

           id="fnref49"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>49</sup></a></p>
    <p>Not just valued for its smell, rosemary was also praised as a food item
        because of its status as a hot and dry herb. Historian David Gentilcore
        characterizes the mid-sixteenth century as a period when “Galenic
        writings formed the basis of elaborate theories about how foods affect
        the human body and what combinations of food would foster optimal
        health.”<a href="#fn50"

           id="fnref50"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>50</sup></a> Humoral theories of balance thus
        influenced eating habits. According to Gentilcore, to balance a person
        or body part with a “cold” complexion or disease, physicians would often
        prescribe “hot” foods.<a href="#fn51"

    <p>References to smells and smoke appear throughout both medicinal and
        non-medicinal recipes in Ms. Fr. 640. The word “smoke” (<em>fumee</em>)
        is used over fifty times and is referred to as a colorant for fabrics
        and metals, as something to be avoided when deemed harmful, as an
        indicator of processes in the workshop, and as a medicinal treatment
        (Table 1). Other recipes mention vapors and breath in similar contexts
        and use indicators of scent (Table 2).<a href="#fn53"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref53"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>53</sup></a> Further, there are a number of

        gilding or good for medicinal smoke. Such sensory knowledge connected

    <p>The history of the use of pipes for smoking herbs provides one way to
        approach “Medicine of the orientals.” It is important to reiterate that
        in the recipe on fol. 77r, the author-practitioner instructs the reader
        to “receive the smoke by a quite tightened mouth” into the head, not the
        lungs. Pipe smoke is typically not inhaled into the lungs, thus the
        author-practitioner could simply be reporting common pipe usage. In some
        of the sources mentioned below, however, accounts of smoking from pipes
        do refer to inhalation into the lungs. Tobacco is the most common herb
        burned in early mentions of pipe use. A history of pipes in a global
        context, therefore, typically centers on the use and trade of tobacco.<a

    <p>Another way of approaching the author-practitioner’s choice of title is
        to look to the possible meaning of his terminology in a
        sixteenth-century context. In early modern Europe, “oriental” was used
        to refer generally to “easterner.”<a href="#fn65"

        France at the time. This reference could therefore be related to the
        diffusion of pipe smoking practices or ideas about eastern uses of smoke
        as medicine. In relation to eastern trade, tobacco smoking spread to
        Asia and Africa in the sixteenth century, while in India the Mughals
        “mixed tobacco with other more familiar leaves, spices and sandalwood”
        and used a water pipe or <em>hookah.</em><a href="#fn66"

        Present-day pipes are generally lit with matches and not charcoal
        (charcoal is still used for water pipes) so I did not find modern
        directions for lighting a pipe with charcoal. The author-practitioner
        does not indicate how much rosemary powder to use, the fineness of the
        powder, or how one packs the powder into the pipe. Through my
        reconstruction I learned that each of these factors is important in the
        successful ignition and delivery of pipe smoke. As a completely
        inexperienced pipe smoker, I was quite slow at the process of preparing
        the pipe so that the rosemary would light and not just get sucked
        through the mouthpiece as a powder. The mention that some smoke will
        come out your nose seems to indicate that the author-practitioner had
        experience either of practicing or witnessing this recipe. The
        author-practitioner does not mention the smell or taste of rosemary or
        warn against the burning experienced if the smoke is swallowed, however.
        This may have already been common knowledge about pipe smoking in the
        period or was deemed irrelevant to the recipe. It remains unclear
        whether the author-practitioner tried this recipe himself.</p>
    <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The recipe “Medicine of the orientals against all maladies” is a product
        of early modern medicinal practice and global exchange. The use of dried
        rosemary in a clay pipe, though perhaps not as common as the use of
        tobacco, is not surprising given the widespread availability and use of
        rosemary in France as an aromatic fumigant and as a medicine in other
        forms. The introduction of the clay pipe to Europe as a smoking
        implement is hard to date precisely, but it appears to have been a
        relatively new item in the mid to late sixteenth century. The
        author-practitioner’s inclusion of a careful drawing of a pipe in the
        recipe on fol. 77r may also indicate the novelty of the implement. The
        reason for the author-practitioner’s use of “oriental” remains obscure
        but may relate to a conflation with eastern smoke delivery systems
        (water pipes) or the importation of pipes from the Americas via trade
        routes in the east. A reconstruction of the recipe leaves uncertain
        whether the author-practitioner had personal experience using the
        aromatic smoke of rosemary in a clay pipe as a medicine or whether he
        learned about this practice from other sources. The inclusion of the
        pipe illustration shows that the author-practitioner either saw a pipe
        in person or had access to a drawing of one.</p>
    <p>Finally, when discussed in relation to other medical and non-medical
        recipes in Ms. Fr. 640, “Medicine of the orientals against all maladies”
        on fol. 77r serves as a starting point for an exploration of smell and
        smoke in the manuscript. The overlap in language and practice suggests
        that more may be learned by examining the medical recipes in the
        manuscript in relation to the sensory processes and knowledge of
        workshop practices.</p>

                    After the recipe “Contre peste” on fol. 170v, there is a
                    list of names and texts that includes “Rembertus Dodonæus
                    mechliniensis medicus | de stirpium historia.” According to
                    Marc Smith, this refers to Rembert Dodoens, <em>Trium
                        priorum de stirpium historia commentariorum imagines ad
                        vivum</em> (Antwerp, 1553). Since the title is included
                    in a list, it cannot be ascertained if the
                    author-practitioner was familiar with the contents of
                    Dodoens’s work.<a href="#fnref29"

                    The author-practitioner notes that this plant is also called
                    arum, which perhaps is related to Matthioli’s noting that
                    its name in Arabic name is “iarus.” Nevertheless, the
                    author-practitioner’s knowledge of the contents of
                    Matthioli’s herbal is difficult to ascertain.<a

                    Further, as discussed in the works of Michael Stolberg and
                    Elaine Leong, medical knowledge during this period was often
                    transmitted through word of mouth, and therefore texts
                    should not be the only factor considered when tracing
                    knowledge transmission. See Stolberg, “‘You Have No Good
                    Blood in Your Body,’” and Leong, “Making Medicines in the
                    Early Modern Household.”<a href="#fnref39"

                    Smith on December 5, 2016, historian Dorothy Ko stated that
                    the earliest mention of tobacco in a Chinese medical
                    treatise was most likely in the late sixteenth century. In
                    this context, smoke was sucked into the lower abdomen so
                    that the <em>qi</em> (material vitality of the smoke) could
                    move up into the heart and lungs to warm the body. For a
                    discussion of the beginning of tobacco smoking and tobacco
                    growing in China, see Carol Benedict, <em>Golden-Silk Smoke:
