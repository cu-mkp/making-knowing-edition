        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <div>
            <p>Two recipes in BnF Ms. Fr. 640 (fols. <a
                   href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/42v/f/42v/tl"><u>42v</u></a>
                and <a
                   href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/10v/f/10v/tl"><u>10v</u></a>)
                describe oil painting on taffeta “without the oil running.”
                However, these recipes contain no information about what exactly
                is meant by “oil running,” what the exact ingredients or their
                quantities are, and why there are two different recipes in the
                manuscript for the same purpose. Exploring these questions, this
                reconstruction shows that when prepared at certain ratios,
                applying a sizing mixture over the surface of the taffeta serves
                to prevent oil paint from seeping into the taffeta fibers, and
                thus stops its diffusion.</p>

    <p>There are two entries on oil painting in BnF Ms. Fr. 640 (fols. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/10v/f/10v/tl"><u>10v</u></a>

           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/42v/f/42v/tl"><u>42v</u></a>)
        that raise questions about the identity of the materials involved, what
        it means to paint “without the oil running,” and which—if any—of the
        alternative instructions can yield proof of concept of this technique.

        “For painting in oil on taffeta without the oil running” (fol. 10v)</h2>
    <blockquote>
        <p>One needs to make a layer of batture, which is made of strong glue
            soaked for 24 hours in water then gently brought to boil so that it
            is hardly strong. Next stir in a little honey to soften it, &amp;
            make it boil all together. And on top of this layer, which will soon
            be dry, you will be able to paint in oil, which will soften the
            layer even more, and which can also serve you to make a seat for
            gold. Alum water also keeps oil from running. (fol. 10v)</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>Fol. 10v contains no information about
        ratios or measurements of the ingredients used, therefore I designed six
        experiments to prepare sizing mixtures by varying amounts of ingredients
        as detailed in my field notes.<a href="#fn3"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref3"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> In addition, I painted on each
        different sizing mixture the same pigment (madder lake) prepared in
        three different oils: 30% thickened linseed oil, 100% linseed oil, and
        30% drying oil. Although linseed oil is the historically more
        appropriate choice, I also tested drying oil for practical purposes. I
        chose my starting materials in consultation with Jo Kirby (National
        Gallery, London, emerita conservator). Following her suggestions, I
        purchased 100% untreated silk taffeta and prepared batture mixtures with
        varying ratios of 10% rabbit skin glue (colle forte), raw honey, and 10%
        potassium aluminum sulfate (water of alum). To begin, I washed and
        stretched silk taffeta on embroidery hoops. Then I divided the taffeta
        into different regions to be able to test different conditions. Although
        fol. 10v calls for boiling batture mixtures, I was reluctant to do this
        because boiling is known to weaken and destroy the structure of skin
        glue.<a href="#fn4"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref4"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> Therefore, half of the mixtures
        were boiled for three minutes, while the rest were warmed to 40–60
        degrees Celsius.</p>
    <p>After applying the test mixture or batture on the taffeta with a brush
        and allowing the mixture to dry overnight, I painted simple lines, dots
        and squares on each test region. Immediately after painting on the
        “test” taffeta, which had no sizing, I noticed that oil spread further
        beyond the edges of the painted area and formed a halo-shaped oil ring.
        In addition to oil, paint was also dispersed, but the dispersion area
        was much smaller than that of the oil. Also, the madder red lake paint
        seeped deeply into the fabric and formed a deep, dark and opaque red
        color (<i><u>Fig. 1</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 2</u></i>). This was also the
        case when I did the same experiment on Bowen and Lou’s unsized taffeta
        sample,<a href="#fn5"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref5"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> but with their fabric, which is
        thicker and colored, the oil and paint dispersion was more prominent and
        easier to see (<i><u>Fig. 3</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 4</u></i>). On the other
        hand, when I painted on the taffeta treated with one of the batture
        mixtures, I noticed that the paint did not seep into the fabric, and it
        formed a lighter and more transparent red color. I also observed that
        while painting over the batture, the paint brush glided over the surface
        much more easily. Interestingly, this was the case for all six
        experimental batture mixtures, some of which contained rabbit skin glue
        alone (<i><u>Fig. 5</u></i>). These experiments made it clear what is
        meant by “oil running” in the recipe, and suggested that 10% rabbit skin
        glue alone, when paired with 30% thickened linseed or linseed binding
        oil, may be enough to stop oil paint from running significantly. I
        noticed that when paint was prepared with 30% drying oil, an oil ring
        was still formed around painted areas, despite the batture. This finding
        highlights that in addition to the batture composition, the choice of
        binding oil is very important to be able to paint on silk without the
        oil running.</p>

                When madder red lake paint was applied directly on taffeta in
                the absence of sizing, I observed a deep, dark red color. The
                paint soaked completely into the fibers and through to the back
                side of the fabric (see Fig. 2). I also observed a halo oil ring
                around painted sections. This oil ring was smaller in A,
                suggesting that this oil mixture is less runny compared to B and

            <figcaption>Fig. 3. Control test on unsized old taffeta, front view.
                Sumeyye Yar, 2017. This taffeta sample is from previous students
                Lou and Bowen. It was painted with madder lake in 100% thickened
                linseed oil, 70% linseed oil mixed with 30%thickened linseed,
                100% linseed oil, 30% pale drying oil and 70% linseed oil mix,
                or 30% dark drying oil mixed with 70% linseed oil as labeled. No
                sizing. Here one can easily see that oil is dispersed and forms
                a halo around the paint when there is no size on the fabric. It
                is much easier to observe this dispersion on the thick and
                coloured taffeta sample like this one. Although oil dispersion
                was observed on all test conditions, it was much smaller when
                100% thickened linseed oil is used. This is expected due to the
                fact that 100% thickened linseed oil dried faster than other
                oils. It is important to note that there is also paint
                dispersion although it is much less than oil dispersion. The
                paint was completely soaked into the textile and through to the
                back of the fabric (see Fig. 4). © Making and Knowing Project

    <p>It may require further investigation to ascertain the individual role(s)
        of honey and water of alum in this recipe. The intention of the use of
        honey, which is a common plasticizer,<a href="#fn6"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref6"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> may be to make the fabric more
        supple so that it can move naturally in the open air, but I failed to
        detect any difference in the softness of the fabric sized with batture
        mixtures that did or did not contain honey. Similarly, I did not observe
        a difference between fabrics treated with <em>batture</em> mixtures with
        or without water of alum, which is traditionally used as a waterproofing
        sizing ingredient.<a href="#fn7"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref7"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
    <p>Interestingly, boiling <em>batture</em> did not affect its function;
        however, the consistency of the mixture became thinner and more liquid,
        which made it easier to apply <em>batture</em> on taffeta. This would
        appear to explain why the author-practitioner advised that the
        <em>batture</em> should be “gently brought to boil so that it is hardly
        strong.”</p>
    <p>As detailed in previous reconstructions,<a href="#fn8"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref8"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> the use of taffeta for banners is
        noted in several early modern sources, including Cennino Cennini’s
        <em>Il libro dell’arte</em>, which contains a section on how to paint on
        silk. In that section, Cennini also describes how to paint on both sides
        of silk: “if the same scene or figure has to be executed on both sides,
        put the stretcher in the sun with the drawing turned toward the sun, so
        that it shines through it.”<a href="#fn9"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref9"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> Since banners meant to be held
        aloft are visible from both sides, painting on both sides of taffeta
        might have been desirable for this purpose. <em>Batture</em> application
        allows painting on both sides of taffeta by preventing the oil from
        penetrating the backside of the fabric. This can be clearly seen in my
        final painting, where the back of the taffeta remained crisp and neat (<i><u>Fig. 6</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 7</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 8</u></i>). For
        this painting I used venetian red and yellow ocher pigments in 30%
        thickened linseed binding oil. The taffeta was sized with one of the
        <em>batture</em> mixtures that I tested before. This <em>batture</em>
        mixture contained rabbit skin glue and water of alum at a two-to-one
        ratio and 2% honey. I decided to use this combination because it
        contained all the ingredients described on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/10v/f/10v/tl"><u>10v</u></a>,
        and it had resulted in slightly crisper brush lines compared to other
        mixtures I tested previously.</p>

    <p>My overall understanding of what the author-practitioner meant by “oil
        running” and how <em>batture</em> may function to stop oil from running
        is similar to Bowen and Lou and the Amsterdam reconstructions; however,
        there are some differences between our testing conditions, ingredients
        and results. In their reconstruction, Bowen and Lou tested different
        <em>batture</em> mixtures prepared with parchment glue, rabbit skin glue
        and diluted rabbit skin glue, and they concluded that <em>batture</em>
        mixture prepared with rabbit skin glue and a few drops of honey was the
        most successful. However, in their case, though it was absent at the
        beginning, an oil ring became visible around painted figures after about
        two weeks. Similarly, <em>batture</em> mixtures prepared in
        reconstructions by Kisters et al. also failed to completely stop
        spreading of oil; however, the details of the painted scenes did not
        seem to be affected by this. Since we all agreed that <em>batture</em>
        mixture prepared with rabbit skin glue paired with linseed binding oil
        seemed to be the most successful, the difference between our results
        might be explained by the different types of taffeta we used. This
        underlines the importance of the choice of taffeta for successful
        application of this recipe. Since there is no information on the
        properties of the taffeta that was used by previous students, it is
        difficult to make a comparison. The <em>Oxford English Dictionary</em>
        (OED) describes taffeta as “a fine lustrous silk or similar synthetic
        fabric with a crisp texture.”<a href="#fn10"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref10"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> Additional research done by

           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref11"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> also confirms that the word
        “taffeta” seems to refer to silk fabric. Therefore I decided to use 100%
        raw and unbleached silk taffeta; however, since I could not find
        unbleached silk taffeta, I instead purchased uncolored 100% silk taffeta
        from testfabrics.com<a href="#fn12"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref12"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> and washed the fabric thoroughly
        before use to get rid of any remaining bleach. Still, further research
        on the properties of taffeta that could have been used by the
        author-practitioner may help better understand this recipe.</p>
    <p>In summary, my experiments showed that a <em>batture</em> mixture
        containing rabbit skin glue functions to prevent oil paint from running
        by forming a physical layer that prevents oil from seeping into the
        taffeta. I also noticed that in addition to the <em>batture</em>
        composition, the choice of the binding oil and the taffeta also play key
        roles in the success of this method. My experiments with varying amounts
        of ingredients suggested that using rabbit skin glue at a ratio anywhere
        between 10% to 6.6 % is enough to stop oil from running. This suggests
        that careful quantification of ingredients may not be crucial for the
        success of this recipe. This may explain why the author-practitioner did
        not see the necessity of providing information about exact ratios or
        measurements of the ingredients. However, another possibility is that
        perhaps making <em>batture</em> was common knowledge at that time, and
        thus the author-practitioner did not go into details of ratios and
        measurements. This could be a point for further historical research. I
        also wonder, since there are no notes on the margins of the recipe
        regarding ingredients and ratios, whether the author-practitioner was
        only a collector of this recipe.</p>

    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>Fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/42v/f/42v/tl"><u>42v</u></a>
        is the second entry in Ms. Fr. 640 that describes how to paint with oil
        on taffeta without the oil running. Although fol. 10v and fol. 42v share
        two of the same ingredients, honey and water of alum, the rabbit skin
        glue in fol. 10v is replaced with “starch water” in this recipe. Also,
        this recipe contains much less detail on how to prepare the sizing layer
        mixture compared to fol. 10v, and it does not contain any information
        about ratios or measurements of the ingredients. Therefore, I prepared
        eight sizing layer mixtures by varying amounts of ingredients for my
        experiments. I chose my starting materials in consultation with Jo
        Kirby, and based on previous historic research done by students from
        Columbia University.<a href="#fn13"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref13"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> Similar to fol. 10v, I used raw
        honey, and 10% potassium aluminum sulfate (water of alum) as my starting
        solutions. For “starch water,” I prepared and used wheat starch paste as
        described in my field notes.<a href="#fn14"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref14"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> I used the same taffeta as in
        fol. 10v and followed the same experimental steps described above. After
        applying the test mixture on the taffeta with a brush, and allowing the
        mixture to dry overnight, I painted on each sizing mixture with the same
        pigment (madder lake) prepared in three different oils; 30% thickened
        linseed oil, 100% linseed oil, and 30% drying oil. To my surprise, only
        one out of eight test mixtures was successful at preventing oil paint
        from seeping into the taffeta fibers (<i><u>Fig. 9</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 10</u></i>). This successful mixture contained raw honey and the
        highest concentration of wheat starch, but it did not contain any water
        of alum. I noticed that this mixture formed the thickest layer over the
        surface of taffeta, although it could still be applied to create a
        smooth surface. Alum water served to dilute the wheat starch in other
        test mixtures, which is probably why those mixtures were not as
        effective in stopping oil from running. The wheat starch paste that I
        prepared contained one part wheat starch in five parts of water. In my
        opinion, if my starting wheat starch concentration were higher (for
        instance, one part in four parts of water) adding some water of alum to
        the mixture could still be effective. The key point seems to be the
        concentration of the wheat starch. Interestingly, although Bowen and
        Lou<a href="#fn15"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref15"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> also used the same wheat starch
        paste in their experiments, they failed to completely stop oil from
        running. Similar to fol. 10v, this finding again highlights the
        importance of the choice of taffeta for successful application of this
        recipe.</p>

                2% honey (0.48g), no water of alum, 24mL wheat starch paste (0%
                final concentration alum). Labeling key: A – red lake prepared

                hand side) was successful at completely stopping the paint from
                seeping into the fabric (see back view in Fig. 10.) #7 was also
                better than #1 through #6 but it was not as good as #8. These
                results suggest that the higher wheat starch paste concentration
                is more effective. © Making and Knowing Project (<a

    <p>In summary, when the correct concentration of wheat starch paste was
        used, the mixture prepared according to fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/42v/f/42v/tl"><u>42v</u></a>
        was successful at preventing oil paint from running on taffeta. However,
        the choice of taffeta is the key to success in this recipe. It is not
        clear why there are two different recipes in the manuscript for the same
        purpose, but perhaps having two different recipes for the same purpose
        was desirable when access to some ingredients was limited due to their
        availability or cost.</p>
