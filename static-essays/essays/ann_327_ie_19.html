<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Ms. Fr. 640 is a manuscript that contains drawings that could be
called technical images—as we can also see, for example, in Leonardo da
Vinci’s notebooks with drawings of machines. Leonardo used his notebooks
as thinking spaces to draw from life, from observation, but also to
experiment on paper with machines that did not yet exist (<i><u>Fig.
1</u></i>). As various scholars have argued, Leonardo saw a sheet of
paper, a page, as a unity, and he used its entirety to experiment on
paper in a combination of images and words.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> The
texts in his manuscripts sometimes annotate the drawings, and sometimes
the texts are actually unrelated to the images. Other early modern
artists, such as Albrecht Dürer, Maarten van Heemskerck, and
Michelangelo kept notebooks in which they jotted down visually their
observations and thoughts about their daily lives. These highly skilled
artists created sketchbooks, filled with drawings and sketches from
which (art) historians have been able to learn a lot about the drawing
and learning practices of artists.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> However, it was not only
artists who kept notebooks; all kinds of practitioners and students kept
them, and all these practices can be bundled together as part of an
early modern note-taking tradition. Putting observations, experiences,
and teaching notes onto paper in private notebooks was a new practice in
the early modern period: paper was more readily available than before,
and the literacy rate had gone up exponentially after the late Middle
Ages.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> Note-taking was more involved than
the word might assume. Note-taking in the early modern period did not
just mean to write down the first thing that came to one’s mind; it
often included, in some way or another, the collation or organization of
information. Recipe books and how-to books can thus also be
characterized as notebooks. Notebooks are often full of words but may
also include drawings, tables, and diagrams—in the margins or in the
main body of the text.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/staging061825-0/images/ann_327_ie_19/1z9WJ1U3UykGxCTzHDyXwynXOlwyHRAvm.jpg" alt="fig. 1"><figcaption>Fig. 1.

<p>How, then, can we think about the author-practitioner of Ms. Fr. 640
and his writings about artistic and even specifically painterly
practices? The manuscript is part of this note-taking tradition in which
we find sketches and drawings as part of a larger written narrative. The
author-practitioner of Ms. Fr. 640 not only wrote his text, he also drew
images in his manuscript. In this essay I will consider several
questions about these images: How can we characterize these images? What
was the aim of these illustrations, how do they relate to the texts and
practices captured by the author-practitioner, and how can we place them
in the context of other late sixteenth-century illustrated manuscripts
and printed texts? And can the images tell us something about the
manuscript and its maker that the text on its own cannot?</p>
<h2 id="epistemic-images">Epistemic Images</h2>
<p>The drawings that we find in Ms. Fr. 640 were not meant to be
artworks, they were meant to be somehow utilitarian. Images of this kind
have been called many things: epistemic, technical, knowing, scientific.
None of these terms is perfect as they are either anachronistic
(scientific), too abstract (epistemic), too restrictive (technical), or
assume too much agency (knowing). Since the 1990s, a growing literature
has addressed this type of image.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> While the initial
discussion focused on the connection and break between our modern
understanding of art versus science, the discussion shifted to
categorizing these images in the early 2000s.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a>
This has resulted in introducing a whole new corpus of images to
historians of art and science while categorizing them as a genre. Over
the past ten years, scholars have moved beyond these initial
explorations of the topic by looking at practices around image making in
the context of knowledge production.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> The Making and Knowing
Project fits very well with this latter approach, attempting to
understand the images of the manuscript not just as free-standing
entities but how they functioned for the author-practitioner in
recording his recipes and his experiences. This approach prompts us to
ask questions such as: what did these illustrations add to the
information captured in words? When did the author-practitioner add
illustrations, and what kind of information did they represent or
collect?</p>
<h2 id="a-general-description-of-the-images-in-ms.-fr.-640">A General
Description of the Images in Ms. Fr. 640</h2>
<p>Ms. Fr. 640 contains many drawings. Of the 170 folios, ca. 90 leaves
carry images, with a total of approximately 150 images. This means that
about a quarter of the bifolia in the manuscript contain images. They
are not evenly divided over the manuscript and differ significantly in
size, as we will see in more detail below. Taken all together, this
signifies that the manuscript is not a highly illustrated manuscript. We
find the first image on fol. <a href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/3v/f/3v/tl"><u>3v</u></a>
(<i><u>Fig.
2</u></i>), the following one on fol. <a href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/6v/f/6v/tl"><u>6v</u></a>,
another one on fol. <a href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/14r/f/14r/tl"><u>14r</u></a>,
and another on fol. <a href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/16r/f/16r/tl"><u>16r</u></a>.
Then we find a high concentration of mainly diagrammatic images on fols.
<a href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/19v/f/19v/tl"><u>19v</u></a>–<a href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/28r/f/28r/tl"><u>28r</u></a>.
The total number of images depends on how they are counted. I took, for
example, the small drawings of tools and equipment on fol. <a href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/94v/f/94v/tl"><u>94v</u></a>
as one image. Apart from images, there are also various signs throughout
the manuscript that show where to continue reading (for example on fol.
<a href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/114r/f/114r/tl"><u>114r</u></a>)
that I have counted as symbols rather than images and of which there are
nineteen. The last symbol on the verso side of the last folio of the
manuscript does not refer to anything, hence the unequal number of
symbols.</p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/staging061825-0/images/ann_327_ie_19/1hVyc2kZdSY4TcV1xb4iSJv3BykqDd61Q.png" alt="fig. 2"><figcaption>Fig. 2. Fol. &lt;3v&gt;: the first image in the manuscript.

<p>Most of the drawings are made in ink of the same color as the text,
making it likely that the drawings were made at the time of writing by
the same person. This would indicate that the drawings were not made by
a separate draftsman or artist but by the author-practitioner of the
manuscript himself. Despite the fact that there are different hands in
the manuscript, the drawings appear on pages of the main scribal hand
and thus seem to be connected directly to the author-practitioner. Even
the drawing of a pipe on fol. <a href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/77r/f/77r/tl"><u>77r</u></a>
(<i><u>Fig.
3</u></i>) is in a part of the text written by the author-practitioner,
even though it falls within a larger section (fols. <a href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/73r/f/73r/tl"><u>73r</u></a>–<a href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/79v/f/79v/tl"><u>79v</u></a>)
that was written in another hand. All of this shows that the practice of
drawing alongside the text was of particular interest to the
author-practitioner for the understanding of his text.</p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/staging061825-0/images/ann_327_ie_19/14IpJQndv_gz5cfPc8LQ9oBsFu_YtYlWh.png" alt="fig. 3"><figcaption>Fig. 3.

<h2 id="the-position-of-the-drawings">The Position of the Drawings</h2>
<p>The images are equally spread over the recto and verso sides of the
pages. The images occur as part of the main text as well as in the
margins. Overall, we find slightly more drawings in the margins than in
the main body of the page, but there is a shift in the manuscript: while
there are more drawings as part of the main body of the text in the
first half of the manuscript, marginal drawings become more abundant in
the second half. According to Marc Smith’s observations, the
author-practitioner used a set of pages that was already bound as the
manuscript/book we can now read.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> When looking at the
place of the text on the page in the digital edition, we see no
difference between a recto and a verso side in terms of the
mise-en-page. Practically, this means that the text is always positioned
a few centimeters from the left edge of the page, continuing to the far
right edge of the paper. This leaves the broader margin always on the
left side of the text, unrelated to whether it is on the front or back
side of the page. There are an equal number of drawings in the margins
on recto sides as there are on the verso sides, so there does not seem
to have been a preferred side of the paper for the author-practitioner.
This might imply that the author-practitioner was right-handed, as a
left-handed draftsman might have had difficulties drawing in the left
margin of the recto page if the sheets were already bound. The
distribution of the images might also indicate that the manuscript was
not strongly bound, as noted by Alexis Hagadorn, and thus easy to open
completely.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>On the basis of the placement of the drawings, we can also say
something about the order in which Ms. Fr. 640 was written. Take for
example fol. <a href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/113r/f/113r/tl"><u>113r</u></a>
(<i><u>Fig.
4</u></i>), where we find three small drawings. Two are placed within
the main text, and the third one can be found in the middle of the
marginal text on the left side of the page. However, this figure,
“un&nbsp;petit instrument recourbe,” or “a small curved instrument,” is
mentioned in the main text just under the other two images. The text in
the margin has nothing to do with this third image that is located
there. This means that the main text and its drawings, including the one
in the margin, were written and drawn first and that the marginal note
was written later, around the already present images. A similar example,
where the drawing in the margin is also directly connected to main text
and was drawn at the same time, can be found on fol. <a href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/135r/f/135r/tl"><u>135r</u></a>
(<i><u>Fig.
5</u></i>). Although the image seems to be part of the marginal note, it
has nothing to do with the content of the text in the margin.</p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/staging061825-0/images/ann_327_ie_19/1f6gsMNk8SIEDYv6PlpcSeslKDbjXCLj-.png" alt="fig. 4"><figcaption>Fig. 4.

<p>The opposite is the case on fol. <a href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/125r/f/125r/tl"><u>125r</u></a>
(<i><u>Fig.
6</u></i>), where the small drawing seems to be part of the main text.
However, the marginal note is so long that it runs both above and below
the first paragraph of main text and even entirely around and across the
heading of the next section (“Plastre”). The drawing here is actually
part of the marginal text and was drawn together with that note. If you
look closely, you can also see a slight difference in color of ink
between the main text and the marginal text and drawing. This indicates
a difference in ink and, therefore, most likely different moments in
which the author-practitioner wrote the main text and the marginal note
plus image. The author-practitioner even drew a box around the first
paragraph of the main text; he must have realized it was hard to
distinguish the text from the comments.</p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/staging061825-0/images/ann_327_ie_19/1YB34kwbxf4vUwhJRpL1B2631xlJzzzjf.png" alt="fig. 6"><figcaption>Fig. 6. Fol. &lt;125r&gt;: the image is seemingly part of the main

<p>In short, the position of the images does not make them more or less
important in their own right. And as readers of Ms. Fr. 640, we have to
be careful to interpret the images correctly as either part of the main
text or the marginal notes. The position of the text and images can tell
us something about the order in which the author-practitioner compiled
his manuscript and used the spaces on his pages.</p>
<h2 id="what-do-the-images-do">What Do the Images Do?</h2>
<p>In her essay on the images in the manuscript, Sophie Macomber has
connected the existing images to the topical categories of Ms. Fr. 640
(<i><u>Fig.
7</u></i>).<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> Of the twenty-six categories
recognized by the Making and Knowing Team (see Smith, “An Introduction
to Ms. Fr. 640 and Its Author-Practitioner”; and “Entry Categories” in
the Resources section), twenty categories have images.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a>
About half of the images are drawn to accompany entries on casting.</p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/staging061825-0/images/ann_327_ie_19/1Oo5GkdNUHV_vELa6anw7SLz5VmZVDOMs.png" alt="fig. 7"><figcaption>Fig. 7. “Distribution of Figures in Ms. Fr. 640,” created by Sophie

the sourcecode of this table.)</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>By discussing some of the images, I will try to understand how the
images could have functioned for the author-practitioner and/or his
readers. Images in how-to texts can have a variety of functions, as I
have shown elsewhere on the basis of the Royal Society’s
seventeenth-century archive of drawings.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a>
Images can, for example, form an integral part of an argument (which is
especially true for mathematical diagrams), function as records of
events (abnormal phenomena, observations, etc.), be references for size
or likeness, or form parts of instructions given in texts.</p>
<p>The images in Ms. Fr. 640 depict a whole range of different things,
from cannon balls, to tools, to mathematical figures, as well as all
kinds of preparations for molding and casting. More than eighty percent
of the figures in the manuscript are figurative, meaning that they
depict something that is derived from a real object and thus represents
this object in some way. The quality and detail of these representations
vary, as we will see below. A small number of images is more
diagrammatic—for example, in the entries about drawing mathematical
figures and the entry about the sizes of cannon balls. A handful of
images show a structure—for example, the structure of cross-hatching or
the structure of dragon’s blood on fol. <a href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/29v/f/29v/tl"><u>29v</u></a>
(<i><u>Fig.
8</u></i>).</p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/staging061825-0/images/ann_327_ie_19/18KLwItMKpKWp8sZvYtBV8eOKjrii6Crx.png" alt="fig. 8"><figcaption>Fig. 8. Detail of fol. &lt;29v&gt; indicating the structure of

gallica.bnf.fr.</figcaption></figure></div>
<h2 id="diagrammatic-images">Diagrammatic Images</h2>
<p>The manuscript contains several entries about drawing and printing
techniques—for example, how to draw perspective. A small related entry
is the one on drawing “Mathematical figures without ruler and compass”
on fol. <a href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/19v/f/19v/tl"><u>19v</u></a>.
The author-practitioner writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>fold your&nbsp;paper&nbsp;such that the fold&nbsp;gives you a straight line, at
the&nbsp;required distance&nbsp;from which, trace a point or a line &amp; saturate
it well with&nbsp;ink. Then fold again the&nbsp;paper&nbsp;&amp; rub it on the back
&amp; it will print however much you have made. In that way, A is the
line without&nbsp;ink which the&nbsp;paper&nbsp;fold gives you, B is the line you have
traced, C is the one which is printed. (<i><u>Fig.
9</u></i>).</p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/staging061825-0/images/ann_327_ie_19/1vU5qkNxSkH9rU8tE4uMg11I6TQh95UEE.png" alt="fig. 9"><figcaption>Fig. 9. Detail from fol. &lt;19v&gt; showing shortcut techniques for
drawing “mathematical figures.” Bibliothèque nationale de France, Paris.
Source: gallica.bnf.fr.</figcaption></figure></div>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="pull-left"></span>As Fig. 9 shows in detail, the four images or diagrams accompany the
text to exemplify the description. In all images, “a” is the line along
which the paper should be folded, “b” signifies the well-inked line that
is to be traced by the image maker, and line “c” then shows the copied
or printed line that should appear after pressing it on the wet ink. It
is interesting to see that the author-practitioner has clearly not used
his own method of making the figures here, as the two sides are in all
cases very different and were not printed from the wet ink by folding
the paper. The function of these images is in this case instructive, and
they accompany and exemplify a textual description. The
author-practitioner makes clear reference to the images in the text, and
the images are really an extension of the textual description. It is
worth noting that, although the form is mathematical and abstract, we do
not learn anything about the use of the mathematical figures in
themselves.</p>
<p>A second example of a set of diagrammatic images is the many cannon
balls depicted by the author-practitioner on fols. <a href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/22r/f/22r/tl"><u>22r</u></a>
and <a href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/26r/f/26r/tl"><u>26r</u></a>–<a href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/27v/f/27v/tl"><u>27v</u></a>

<p><span class="pull-left"></span>Sarah Muñoz has already provided some context about the artillery
interests of the author-practitioner within the local context.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> In the text on fol. <a href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/24r/f/24r/tl"><u>24r</u></a>,
we find unpleasantly detailed descriptions of the effects of cannon
balls when they are made according to the method described:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The&nbsp;<em>metal</em>&nbsp;of a large bell&nbsp;is
made&nbsp;with&nbsp;3&nbsp;quintals&nbsp;of&nbsp;rosette&nbsp;&amp; twenty or xxv&nbsp;lb of&nbsp;tin.
Each&nbsp;grenade&nbsp;must weigh four to six&nbsp;lb. And in order to throw them, it
is necessary that they be full of&nbsp;powder&nbsp;mixed
with&nbsp;coarsely&nbsp;pestled&nbsp;glass. And for a quarter&nbsp;lb&nbsp;of&nbsp;powder, one needs
half an&nbsp;ounce&nbsp;of&nbsp;glass&nbsp;which is put with it, in order that on
the&nbsp;face&nbsp;or places where the&nbsp;powder&nbsp;will have its effect,
the&nbsp;wounds&nbsp;will be all the worse for it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="pull-left"></span>The metal (i.e., <em>metal</em>, a particular copper alloy) for the
cannons needs to be sourced, and apparently church bells are especially
convenient. With a large bell weighing 20–25 lb and a grenade 4–6 lb,
one can make four to six balls out of one church bell. While the weights
are mentioned in the text, as are the lengths of several types of
cannon, the sizes of the balls are <em>shown</em> in the images drawn.
Fol. <a href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/22r/f/22r/tl"><u>22r</u></a>
carries a “cannon ball, weighing 40 lb, having 12 lines, king’s foot.”
The image, however, has been discounted by the author-practitioner as “a
little too big,” and he points the reader to the following one, several
folios further, where the text indeed helps the reader to understand
that “this is the true measure of the caliber, but the borer always
takes away a little more” (fol. <a href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/26r/f/26r/tl"><u>26r</u></a>).
It looks like the author-practitioner wanted to indicate very precisely
the sizes of cannon balls for the various cannons and guns that were
used at the time. The circles are abstract and simple representations of
the broadest circumference of the ball, which could then be used,
presumably, as the size for a mold for making metal balls. On fol. <a href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/27v/f/27v/tl"><u>27v</u></a>
the author-practitioner goes further in not only indicating the sizes of
the balls by the names of the particular guns and cannons they are for
but also naming equivalents—for example, a “falconet of 4 quintals,
alternatively passe-volant, is 8 pans long”—thus including the different
names for the types of artillery that were used around his place of
working so that there might not be any confusion.</p>
<p>The size of cannonballs was important precision work. Special tools
for measuring the caliber of cannons and firearms as well as shot
existed—see, for example, a caliper compass (<i><u>Fig.
11</u></i>) and a gunner’s rule (<i><u>Fig.
12</u></i>) both from Museo Galileo in Florence, Italy. From several
early modern books on artillery practices, we can deduce that the
problem of having the diameter and needing to calculate the
circumference was a common one. In John Seller’s <em>The Sea-Gunner:
Shewing the Practical Part of Gunnery, as it is Used at Sea</em> (1691),
for example, in the chapter on “Arithmetical problems appertaining to
the Art of Gunnery,” the first problem reads, “The diameter of a Circle
being given, to find the Circumference.”<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a>
Hence, part of a gunner’s practical knowledge, and certainly also part
of a founder’s, was to be able to use a given diameter for the making of
a cannon ball. In most printed books on the subject from the seventeenth
century, calculation tables were published to help artisans quickly find
correct sizes and measurements.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a></p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/staging061825-0/images/ann_327_ie_19/1TJxvOuHd1SqZxQOkfeBpAHfPm-Oi-bu8.jpg" alt="fig. 11"><figcaption>Fig. 11.

<p>In Ms. Fr. 640 the depictions of the diameters of cannon balls seem
to have a visual function only, to recognize sizes. Apart from the text
in the circles themselves, the author-practitioner does not refer to the
images in any other part of the text.</p>
<h2 id="figurative-images">Figurative Images</h2>
<p>In contrast with the images of cannon balls that are not referred to
in the text, in the entry on “Fountains,” on fol. <a href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/80r/f/80r/tl"><u>80r</u></a>,
text and image go hand-in-hand (<i><u>Fig.
13</u></i>).</p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/staging061825-0/images/ann_327_ie_19/1WdpvcoBxHXZz_Xr8uf7pHzqL1t7fiero.png" alt="fig. 13"><figcaption>Fig. 13. Detail of fol. &lt;80r&gt; depicting how to get water to a
higher point than its source. Bibliothèque nationale de France, Paris.

<blockquote>
<p>If you wish to make&nbsp;water&nbsp;rise higher than its source, make
a&nbsp;pipe&nbsp;descend as in A to B. in order to give it push, then from B&nbsp;to
C&nbsp;make the&nbsp;pipe&nbsp;ascend again, which should not quite attain the height
of the source, which is represented to you by this horizontal line, then
make the&nbsp;pipe&nbsp;descend again from C to D, then raise it again, higher
than the line showing the height of the source. And do this successively
until you have reached the desired height, heeding nonetheless that the
length of the descending&nbsp;pipe&nbsp;should be&nbsp;twice as long as the
ascending&nbsp;pipe.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="pull-left"></span>If we read the text without its references to the image, it is as
follows: “If you wish to make&nbsp;water&nbsp;rise higher than its source, make
a&nbsp;pipe&nbsp;descend. In order to give it push&nbsp;make the&nbsp;pipe&nbsp;ascend again,
which should not quite attain the height of the source, then make
the&nbsp;pipe&nbsp;descend again, then raise it again, higher than the height of
the source. And do this successively until you have reached the desired
height, heeding nonetheless that the length of the
descending&nbsp;pipe&nbsp;should be&nbsp;twice as long as the ascending&nbsp;pipe.”&nbsp;An
experienced aqueduct builder would probably understand immediately how
the mechanism functions, but for any other reader the illustration is
needed to visualize the points made by the author-practitioner. Turning
this around, the image can be read without the text to get the general
idea of the mechanism, however, the final sentence about the lengths of
the descending and ascending pipes (essential for the process) is not
visible in the drawing. We can thus say that, in this case, image and
text are interwoven and need each other to be fully understandable.</p>
<p>The additional image immediately to the left is a representation of
what is now called Robert Boyle’s perpetual flask. Not only is its
modern name misleading, clearly post-dating its invention, but this
image—in contrast to the image just discussed—gives the reader no clear
indication of how to use it. The description reads: “This&nbsp;cornet&nbsp;folded
back on itself also shows you a perpetual fountain which you can fit
into some rock, pulling the&nbsp;water&nbsp;with which it is filled by the tip
marked E, by sucking &amp; breathing in.” Here the image is also
described and somewhat explained in the text, but without reading the
text, even less of the image can be understood. Hence, both images work
hand-in-hand with the text and, as such, image and text in these cases
should be interpreted together.</p>
<p>Let us now consider the illustrations in the many entries on
lifecasting, the largest topic in Ms. Fr. 640. The images that are part
of the entries on making molds for casting are all figurative, and they
contain information about the making of clay slabs and walls for plaster
molds, the arrangement of dead animals on the clay for lifecasting, the
positioning of casting channels in the mold, etc. All these images are
highly pragmatic in character. Several of the entries for cast making
have been reconstructed by students and collaborators on the Making and
Knowing Project. As we can see, for example, in essays by Pamela Smith
and Fabien Noirot, the images provide essential information for the
process of making casts.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> The images illustrate
the casting infrastructure, showing the gates one needs to add to the
mold so that the material that will be used to make the cast can enter
the mold (<i><u>Fig.
14</u></i>, <i><u>Fig.
15</u></i>, <i><u>Fig.
16</u></i>).</p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/staging061825-0/images/ann_327_ie_19/1x87wIyQvtZXzyV0OB5YxJQO_UHsaNyTl.png" alt="fig. 14"><figcaption>Fig. 14. Fol. &lt;155r&gt; demonstrating how a rose should be molded

<p><span class="pull-left"></span>The accompanying text does not give any information on how to
position the gates in any of the three cases shown in Fig. 13. The
author-practitioner gives details about the size of the gates—“very wide
[…] [but] not be too thick” (fol. <a href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/127r/f/127r/tl"><u>127r</u></a>),
or “Your gate must be very thin at the entrance of the animal &amp; of
the&nbsp;thickness of a&nbsp;knife” (fol. <a href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/124v/f/124v/tl"><u>124v</u></a>)—but
the actual placing of the gates can only be seen in the pictures. With a
third of the manuscript filled with information about making casts, it
seems that these images are especially valuable for the
author-practitioner: they register information that is difficult to
capture in words but is essential for the success of the process. In
these images we can see how text and image work together in a very
efficient way, not duplicating information but, on the contrary, adding
details that can only be captured in an image.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>All the images in Ms. Fr. 640, whether figurative or diagrammatic,
help the reader to do things: to easily draw diagrams, to measure cannon
balls, to make beautiful casts. The images were not drawn to visually
impress, or for purely aesthetic reasons, but rather as information
carriers, to give the author-practitioner and his readers more
information than could be covered in only a narrative text. The images
are thus an integral part of the manuscript and its practical
entries.</p>
<p>We could say, therefore, that the author-practitioner was a person
who took notes in both verbal and visual form, someone who related to
information in a variety of ways. And as we have seen in the entries in
Ms. Fr. 640 and in the many reconstructions that the Making and Knowing
Project has made and registered in <em>Secrets of Craft and Nature</em>,
he was pragmatic, and he was learning, collecting, and understanding
information about processes of making during his writing. In his
manuscript he included as many tiny images as he needed to capture all
these parts of the puzzle. This was much more possible in manuscript
than it would have been in print at the time, thus his manuscript gave
him the freedom to include visual tools and reminders to himself that no
printed book would have given him.</p>
