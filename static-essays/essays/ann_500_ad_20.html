        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <div>
            <p>In sixteenth-century Europe, animals often served as allegorical
                embodiments of moral principles, while toads and vipers, in
                particular, were valued primarily for their putative medicinal
                value. In a marked departure from these conventions, the
                author-practitioner records his thoughts on capturing,
                restraining, maintaining, and killing these animals. Although
                not a natural historian by vocation, in the course of casting
                amphibians and reptiles from life into objects of art, he
                amassed considerable knowledge of the habits and characteristics
                of this often spurned class of animals, especially of vipers.
                The few people who dealt with these animals—including other
                artisans, viper catchers, and apothecaries—did not record their
                observations. In this essay, I survey the author-practitioner’s
                forays into herpetological husbandry, capture techniques, and
                methods of euthanasia. I compare these observations with the few
                other accounts from the time, which do not contain the detail or
                accuracy found in Ms. Fr. 640.</p>

    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
    <p>Some years ago I came across the Making and Knowing Project’s
        edition-in-development of BnF Ms. Fr. 640 as part of my research into
        the role of vipers in Renaissance Florence.<a href="#fn1"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref1"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> As a former reptile keeper at the
        Smithsonian’s National Zoo, and now a docent at the National Gallery of
        Art in Washington DC, it was refreshing to find a text that, for its
        time, treated reptiles in a straightforward manner. With few exceptions,
        the herpetological observations in Ms. Fr. 640 are non-judgmental and
        offered solely as practical advice on obtaining, maintaining,
        euthanizing, and ultimately casting these animals into objects of art.
        In this essay, I explore the author-practitioner’s approach to reptiles
        and amphibians and compare his views not only to the prevailing schools
        of thought in sixteenth-century Europe but to later opinions as well—up
        to those of the present day.</p>
    <p>Scientific writing in Europe began dealing with nature as a legitimate
        topic of discourse in about the mid-sixteenth century. Prior to that
        time, responses to nature were often recorded only in the course of (1)
        an investigation of another subject, such as the Christian moralizing of
        medieval bestiaries;<a href="#fn2"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref2"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> (2) concocting remedies for
        maladies; or (3) repelling or trapping various animals.<a href="#fn3"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref3"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> Herpetological references were
        scarce and fleeting.</p>
    <p>This should not come as a revelation; reptiles and amphibians in Europe
        were never valued as food—apart from their medicinal value, there was
        little impetus to study them.<a href="#fn4"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref4"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> For instance, the <em>Hortus
            Sanitatis</em>, the compendium of healing that appeared in the late
        fifteenth century, described not only plants but the animal species of
        the natural world, focusing on their medicinal value.<a href="#fn5"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref5"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
    <p>As the publication of herbals proliferated in Europe, the study of
        animals struggled to establish a firm footing in the universities and
        medical curricula of the period—it was often a poor cousin to botany.<a
           href="#fn6"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref6"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> By 1560, however, natural history
        as a discipline had crystallized.<a href="#fn7"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref7"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> The appearance of Conrad Gesner’s
        (1516–1565) monumental <em>Historiae Animalium</em> (1551–58) laid the
        groundwork for the study of animals that would become known as
        scientific zoology. Considered from that perspective to be the first
        modern zoological work, its aim was to survey the entire animal kingdom.
        Over 500 pages, however, were devoted to the history and care of horses,
        cows, dogs, goats, and chickens.</p>
    <p>Even so, very few natural history texts went into multiple printings. One
        notable exception was Pietro Andrea Mattioli’s (1501–1577)
        <em>Commentaries on the materia medica of Dioscorides</em>, first
        published in 1544. Within a quarter-century, 30,000 copies of this
        herbal had already been sold.<a href="#fn8"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref8"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> Given its immense popularity, it
        comes as no surprise that Ms. Fr. 640 contains a reference to Mattioli
        (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/35v/f/35v/tl"><u>35v</u></a>)
        vouching for the safety of two bitter herbs (one of which is,
        ironically, toxic). The <em>Commentaries</em> contained approximately
        three dozen herpetological references—usually noting which plants either
        counteracted poisoning from snakes or toads or repelled these bothersome
        creatures.</p>
    <h2 id="toadstones-and-toads">Toadstones and Toads</h2>
    <p>One interesting comment in Ms. Fr. 640 (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/13v/f/13v/tl"><u>13v</u></a>)
        seems to reflect the pharmacological wisdom of the age. It describes the
        Toadstone as</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>The kind which comes from the head of the&nbsp;toad&nbsp;&amp; has
            the figure of the&nbsp;toad painted naturally [….] It is held that
            if one puts the powder of it on a&nbsp;brazier&nbsp;in
            the&nbsp;chamber&nbsp;of some persons&nbsp;at night,&nbsp;they will
            be neither able to move, nor speak, nor thwart&nbsp;thieves.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>The belief in a magical stone found in the
        head of a toad was widespread in Europe. We see it illustrated in a
        woodcut (<i><u>Fig. 1</u></i>) from the <em>Hortus Sanitatis</em>. This
        legendary stone was held to be a remedy against plague and other
        ailments. The notion had such traction that the eighteenth-century
        French chemist, Nicholas Lémery (1645–1715), felt compelled to set the
        record straight and affirm that the stones were, in actuality, the molar
        teeth from a West Indian species of Marine fish.<a href="#fn9"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref9"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> Toadstones, as well as other
        variations of prepared toads, remained popular in the use of amulets to
        ward off pestilential diseases. These remedies eventually lost favor in
        the eighteenth century, perhaps owing to the disappearance of bubonic
        plague from western Europe.<a href="#fn10"

        held in contempt.<a href="#fn11"

        reflects the strong antipathy toward toads in Europe.</p>
    <p>From the second century, bestiaries like the <em>Physiologus</em>
        employed toads and other animals in their allegories to promote
        Christian values. The third-century author Aelian (ca. 170–ca. 235 CE)
        claimed that if a man gazed at a toad, it would stare back, breathe on
        him, and sicken him.<a href="#fn12"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref12"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> Even Leonardo da Vinci
        (1452–1519), borrowing from the fourteenth-century best seller the
        <em>Fior di virtù</em>, writes this of avarice: “The toad feeds on earth
        and always remains lean; because it never eats enough—it is so afraid
        lest it should want for earth.”<a href="#fn13"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref13"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
    <p>The toad’s reputation did not improve over time. Carl Linnaeus
        (1707–1778), father of binomial nomenclature, demonstrated his aversion
        to snakes and toads in several instances, including this description
        from his 1758 <em>Systema Naturae</em>:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>…most amphibians are rough with a cold body, ghastly color, foul
            skin, fierce face […], foul odor, harsh call, squalid habitat and
            terrible venom. Their Author [God] has not, therefore done much
            boasting on their account.<a href="#fn14"
               class="footnote-ref"
               id="fnref14"
               role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>Well into the following century a French
        naturalist felt the need to enlighten us to the fact that “Toads are
        squat and disagreeable in shape […] it is difficult to comprehend why
        nature has stamped [it] with so repulsive a form.”<a href="#fn15"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref15"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> It would appear, then, that the
        author-practitioner is in good company. Beyond aesthetics, however, a
        curious allegation on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/109v/f/109v/tl"><u>109v</u></a>
        of Ms. Fr. 640 asserts that</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>if [the toad] were to&nbsp;piss&nbsp;in your&nbsp;hand, it would burn
            your&nbsp;hand&nbsp;&amp; itch, as if you had handled&nbsp;nettles.
            But the most powerful&nbsp;remedy&nbsp;for this is to put your
            hand&nbsp;into fresh&nbsp;earth&nbsp;&amp; to cover it as if you
            wanted to bury it.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>This treatment apparently works for snakes
        as well, since we are advised on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/110r/f/110r/tl"><u>110r</u></a>
        that upon being bitten or fouled by a snake one should “bury his hand in
        fresh &amp; damp earth [….] [which] pulls out all the venom and nothing
        else. It is the same with toad’s venom.” It is difficult to divine the
        origins of this fallacy, since toad urine is not caustic, and if it
        were, hand washing would be a more effective recourse than dirt.
        Nevertheless, this notion persisted in folk wisdom and was perpetuated
        in one form or another even by learned scholars. Linnaeus remarked in
        his diary that when bitten by a snake “The peasants […] submerge the
        injured limb in the soil.”<a href="#fn16"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref16"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> To his credit, Linnaeus also
        observed that “it is possible […] if one seizes the [toad] with forceps,
        then she pisses from each wart a white juice, which damages and
        poisons.”<a href="#fn17"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref17"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> It is true that, while toad
        urine is benign, the glandular secretions are toxic. What is puzzling is
        that the author-practitioner, who had surely handled many toads in the
        course of his practice, would have failed to make that distinction.</p>
    <h2 id="making-the-catch">Making the Catch </h2>
    <p>Aside from several technical entries on the molding of toads and frogs,
        the author-practitioner has little else to say on these animals. That
        there is no discussion of capturing or maintaining toads signifies that
        this endeavor is so unremarkable that its details just go without
        saying—toads are relatively easy to find and probably one of the easiest
        animals to catch. This is assuredly not the case with vipers and
        lizards. Consequently, Ms. Fr. 640 contains a trove of observations
        regarding characteristics, habits, and capture techniques of these
        reptiles.</p>
    <p>Old tropes, such as “the only good snake is a dead snake,” die hard. A
        print from Mattioli’s <em>Commentaries</em> shows a farmer in the
        background preparing to kill a snake (<i><u>Fig. 2</u></i>). Unlike this
        farmer, the author-practitioner does not have the option of maiming the
        snake—the specimen must be in pristine condition—intact and suitable for
        molding. This being the overriding goal, considerable attention is given
        to non-damaging capture techniques, none of which involve beating the
        animal to death with a branch or scythe.</p>

    <p>The author-practitioner takes pains to reassure us that, unless they are
        large, snakes seldom bite when taken (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/110r/f/110r/tl"><u>110r</u></a>);
        “water snakes hardly bite” (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/112r/f/112r/tl"><u>112r</u></a>);
        and that, according to the crayfishers, “they [vipers] hardly ever bite
        in water” (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/107r/f/107r/tl"><u>107r</u></a>).
        I find these statements perplexing, given that European vipers are
        terrestrial and water snakes feed on fish—which they will bite and eat
        while submerged. From personal experience, I can affirm that water
        snakes will bite underwater.</p>
    <p>On more solid ground, the author-practitioner prompts the reader to use a
        thick woolen cloth to capture snakes since the teeth are too small to
        penetrate the fabric (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/107r/f/107r/tl"><u>107r</u></a>).
        He offers additional hints (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/110r/f/110r/tl"><u>110r</u></a>),
        such as placing one’s foot on the snake, close to the neck, and grabbing
        it close to the head because the snake</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>cannot bite if it does not have the means to stretch its neck &amp;
            make a sinuous &amp; oblique turn, &amp; it cannot harm with a
            direct attack, since he cannot move forward in a direct line, but
            writhes in the shape of an S.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>This is sound advice. Another technique I
        have used, particularly with larger snakes, is to grab the tail (which
        is often the last thing you see before the animal scoots off), gently
        sling the snake between the your legs (clamping the legs together), and
        slowly pull the snake forward until you can restrain the head. I should
        add, this is not advised for venomous snakes, and it would be a good
        idea to wear heavy jeans.<a href="#fn18"

    <p>The snakes caught by the author-practitioner were destined for
        lifecasting. Objects with lifecast flora and fauna were very much sought
        after in the sixteenth century, and they graced many a

        the author-practitioner acknowledges that “The lizard is more tedious to
        catch by hand than the snake &amp; bites without letting go &amp; grips
        like pincers.” Therefore, he recommends noosing lizards with a string
        fashioned into a slip-knot while having some assistants distract
        the&nbsp;lizard&nbsp;by whistling. This 400-year-old technique is
        remarkably similar to current practice, although herpetologists are
        continually refining the procedure.<a href="#fn21"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref21"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
    <p>There is considerable detail on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/111v/f/111v/tl"><u>111v</u></a>
        on restraining lizards after capture, such as, “one takes them with two
        fingers from the sides of the head […] makes them open their&nbsp;mouth
        […] takes the end of its lower mandible with the end of the fingernail…
        [and so forth].” He seems to be concerned that one not get bitten
        because “[the lizard] clenches very strongly. And if he were to bite
        living&nbsp;flesh&nbsp;it would not let go, &amp; there would be no
        better remedy than to promptly cut off his head.”&nbsp;Clearly, that
        would defeat the objective. It is true that large lizards have a strong
        bite and can be extremely reluctant to release their grip; however,
        there are less draconian ways to persuade them to disengage, such as
        immersion in water or pouring spirits into their mouth. At the National
        Zoo we used a commercially available mouthwash which, when sprayed into
        the mouth, effected a quick release.</p>
    <h2 id="hunting-vipers">Hunting Vipers</h2>
    <p>Prior to the modern era, reptile capture had never been treated with the
        level of detail seen in Ms. Fr. 640. This is in spite of the fact that
        vipers were an important commodity to the apothecaries of Europe. Vipers
        were an essential ingredient in <em>theriac</em>, a medicinal
        preparation dating back to Galen (129–ca. 200 CE), which remained the
        most sought-after antidote in Europe for the plague.<a href="#fn22"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref22"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
    <p>There are numerous references in the literature to viper catchers, who
        hailed from a profession that tended to be hereditary and was not in the
        habit of publishing its methods. Their trade secrets and, more
        importantly, the location of hunting grounds were rarely divulged.<a
           href="#fn23"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref23"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a> Although modern herpetologists
        freely share information that furthers the profession, they may also be
        reluctant to publish details detrimental to their field work. A
        colleague of mine, for instance, has documented over 500 Timber
        Rattlesnake dens along the Appalachian Mountains. Whenever we went into
        the field together, I had to swear never to reveal the location of any
        dens we visited. There was a legitimate concern that visitors or
        unscrupulous snake collectors would disrupt the balance of those
        sensitive snake populations.</p>
    <p>The dearth of information in the early literature on snake hunting makes
        two sixteenth-century illustrations even more remarkable. The first (<i><u>Fig. 7</u></i>) is of a viper catcher, which appeared in
        multiple editions of Mattioli’s <em>Commentaries</em>. Given the
        author-practitioner’s reference to Mattioli (fol. 35v), he may even have
        seen this image. The viper catcher we see in this rather idealized
        depiction is clearly not concerned about snakebite and is not using any
        tools, other than his hands. He is more comfortable than I would have
        been.</p>

    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>With the exception of the dogs and of the
        vipers feeding on toads, this tableau mirrors a description of viper
        catchers from <em>The History of Drugs</em>, a seventeenth-century tract
        compiled by Pierre Pomet (1658–1699), pharmacist to Louis XIV:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>[vipers] are to be taken either by the End of the Tail, or else with
            a Pair of Tongs; because this Animal, when he finds himself
            squeezed, bites whatever he meets with […] the Reason why the Takers
            of them ought to be very cautious. The Keepers of them ought to be
            so likewise, lest by Mischance they should escape and get into any
            House, which would be very dangerous, especially where there are
            Children.<a href="#fn24"

               id="fnref24"
               role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>Pomet also goes on to record that
        “<em>Vipers</em> breed in wild stony places in <em>Dauphiny</em> and
        <em>Poitou</em>” and that the peasants “take the <em>Vipers</em> in
        Spring Time or Autumn, because they are then fatter, and more active
        than in any other Season.” This accords with what we know of
        <em>theriac</em> production throughout the early modern period in Italy.
        Most sizable cities conducted a ceremony beginning in May, when vipers
        were captured and killed for that therapeutic potion.<a href="#fn25"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref25"

    <p>Other than the recognition that reptiles shelter underground in the
        winter (fols. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/116r/f/116r/tl"><u>116r</u></a>,
        <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/143r/f/143r/tl"><u>143r</u></a>),
        Ms. Fr. 640 is silent on when and where to find vipers. The greatest
        likelihood of seeing vipers is in spring, when they are emerging from
        their hibernacula. On the other hand, they would be fatter in the fall
        after feeding all summer. Perhaps the author-practitioner, as many
        generations of vipers catchers had done before, felt this was a “secret”
        better passed on orally.</p>
    <h2 id="observing-nature">Observing Nature</h2>
    <p>The author-practitioner’s appreciation for the viper is palpable when he
        praises the animal in such terms as “It is the most
        beautiful&nbsp;snake&nbsp;that can be molded, because it has very
        beautiful scales…” (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/129r/f/129r/tl"><u>129r</u></a>).
        In another entry he goes on to describe the viper further:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>I molded a viper, which, for casting is more appropriate than any
            other snake because it has scales beautiful &amp; very visible on
            all the body &amp; principally on the head and under the throat. It
            has a flat head, the snout reddish […] &amp; snubbed like
            the&nbsp;horned asp […] big jowls, the eyes very close to the snout,
            and the mouth wide open, where it has double canine teeth on each
            side, all coming out of a strip of flesh that covers and clothes
            them.… (fol. <a
               href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/125v/f/125v/tl"><u>125v</u></a>).
        </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>This description suggests that he is familiar with not only the Asp Viper
        (<em>Vipera aspis</em>) found in Toulouse, but with other horned vipers,
        such as the Lataste’s Viper (<em>V. latasti</em>), which is found in
        Spain.<a href="#fn26"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref26"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a> The accuracy of this observation

        that reads, “The dangerous [snakes] are recognized by their blue &amp;
        azure eyes.” Note that <i><u>Fig. 9</u></i> clearly shows the red
        eyes and vertically elliptical pupils found in all European vipers,
        which Linnaeus correctly describes as “The iris colored as fire, the
        pupil vertical and black.” It is not clear what the author-practitioner
        was referring to—perhaps by “blue” he had in mind the eyes of a snake
        about to shed its skin. Since all snakes do that, however, this is not a
        helpful diagnostic trait.<a href="#fn27"

    <p>Another discordant note in the margin of fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/124v/f/124v/tl"><u>124v</u></a>
        is, “The principal thing is that the ears of the&nbsp;snake&nbsp;come
        out well-molded.” Surely the author-practitioner must have known that
        snakes lack external ears. The author-practitioner is on firmer ground
        in noting that vipers have fangs and that “Other&nbsp;snakes&nbsp;have a
        double row of teeth” (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/125v/f/125v/tl"><u>125v</u></a>).
        He goes on to accurately describe the tongue sheath on the lower jaw as
        a “tube of flesh, made like a&nbsp;dog’s penis, from which comes its
        stinger.” I do not recall this particular comparison having ever been
        made.</p>
    <p>Also, in perhaps the first written description of the male viper’s paired
        sexual organ, the hemipenis, the author-practitioner notes that “The
        male ejects from its nature, which is at the bottom, when it is firmly
        pressed, a little mass like half an arquebus ball made in the genitals
        and full of very venomous spurs” (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/129r/f/129r/tl"><u>129r</u></a>).
        Other than misreading the true nature of the spurs (which aid in
        attaching the hemipenis to the female’s cloaca), this is a spot-on
        observation—quite remarkable for its time.</p>
    <h2 id="herpetological-husbandry">Herpetological Husbandry</h2>
    <p>The body of work regarding herpetological husbandry prior to the modern
        era is quite meager and references that do exist are tantalizingly
        lacking in detail. The art historian Giorgio Vasari (1511–1574) tells us
        that the Florentine painter Pesello (1367–1446)</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>took so much pleasure in counterfeiting animals, of which he kept
            some of all sorts alive in his house, and made them so lifelike and
            vivacious, that there was no one in his time who equaled him in this
            branch of his profession.<a href="#fn28"
               class="footnote-ref"
               id="fnref28"
               role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>Then, there was one, Gisbert Horstius, who
        in the mid-sixteenth century kept serpents in what was evidently a
        rock-walled enclosure in his garden in Rome, apparently for the benefit
        of artists and naturalists whom he would occasionally entertain. He had
        a reputation for being able to handle snakes fearlessly without being
        bitten.<a href="#fn29"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref29"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
    <p>In both these cases there was a professional or monetary benefit in
        maintaining captive specimens. Likewise, there was a compelling
        motivation for the author-practitioner to do the same. The arrival of a
        fresh specimen might not always coincide with the shop’s timetable.
        Several entries in Ms. Fr. 640 underscore the importance of using a
        freshly killed animal “before it becomes thin. One ought to put it to
        death only a&nbsp;quarter of an hour&nbsp;before you want to&nbsp;mold”
        (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/110r/f/110r/tl"><u>110r</u></a>).
        He reiterates the point that keeping an animal too long before killing
        would result in an emaciated specimen that will not cast well (fols. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/106r/f/106r/tl"><u>106r</u></a>,
        <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/110r/f/110r/tl"><u>110r</u></a>,
        <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/112r/f/112r/tl"><u>112r</u></a>,
        <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/115r/f/115r/tl"><u>115r</u></a>).
        Hence, several entries deal with housing and feeding specimens that
        could not be molded promptly. Husbandry, however short-term, was a
        necessary means to an end.</p>

        author-practitioner, who enjoins the keeper to “give [snakes] any
        live&nbsp;frog&nbsp;or other little live animal, for they do not eat
        anything dead” (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/109r/f/109r/tl"><u>109r</u></a>).
        There must have been instances where the snake regurgitated its meal,
        especially if handled (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/110v/f/110v/tl"><u>110v</u></a>),
        which apparently led to the observation that a snake “can keep a frog
        engulfed for two to three hours &amp; renders it up completely alive”
        (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/109v/f/109v/tl"><u>109v</u></a>).
        Johann Bechstein, an eighteenth-century naturalist, also noted that
        “Often I have cut open a snake which had swallowed a frog, and the frog
        jumped out again.”<a href="#fn33"

    <p>In the course of maintaining his snakes, the author-practitioner had
        occasion to observe their behavior, leading to a most remarkable passage
        revealing that, however pragmatic his husbandry practices may have been,
        the underlying Christian ethic was never too far beneath the surface. He
        has “noticed that when they [snakes] want to bite or eat something, they
        do not bite with a direct attack but with sinuous turns &amp; from the
        side, as do&nbsp;Satan&nbsp;&amp; his&nbsp;disciples” (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/109r/f/109r/tl"><u>109r</u></a>).
        He goes on to describe the snake’s mouth in metaphorical terms: “It has
        a small head but a very long body. The entryway to sin seems small &amp;
        inconsequential, but the consequences of it are very great.” This evokes
        the medieval bestiary tradition of using animals as allegorical devices
        to elucidate moral principles.</p>
    <h2 id="killing-and-preserving">Killing and Preserving</h2>
    <p>The enterprise of capturing, housing, and feeding specimens is entirely
        in the service of one objective—obtaining a pristine model for casting.
        Unfortunately, there is no avoiding the final step—killing the animal.
        In <em>The Book of Art</em>, Cennino Cennini (ca. 1360–before 1427)
        notes that</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>You may similarly cast any member separately, an arm, a hand, a foot,
            a leg, a bird, a beast or any kind of animal or fish. But the
            animals must be dead, because they have neither the sense or
            firmness to stand still.<a href="#fn34"

    <p>Naturalists, who often accompanied ships in the eighteenth and nineteenth
        centuries to catalogue and collect new life forms, also needed to
        preserve animals for voucher specimens. Because glass containers were
        expensive, difficult to seal, and fragile, herpetological specimens
        (prior to 1800) were usually preserved in wooden casks with various
        combinations of ethyl alcohol.<a href="#fn37"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref37"

           id="fnref38"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
    <p>Today, herpetological specimens are generally euthanized using injectable
        barbiturate drugs. In the field, this is not always feasible, so
        chloroform, ether, or alcohol are often used.<a href="#fn39"

           id="fnref39"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>39</sup></a> Post-mortem specimens are
        preserved in alcohol, formalin, and, occasionally, brine. Except for the
        availability of syringes and modern fixatives, the euthanasia and
        preservation of animals detailed in Ms. Fr. 640 are quite similar to
        current practices.</p>
    <p>As an indication of how important it was to secure an intact specimen for
        molding, the author-practitioner devotes considerable attention to
        methods of both killing and preserving these animals. There are no fewer

        describing various combinations of brandy, spirits, vinegar, and even
        urine—all designed to kill the animal quickly, with minimal damage or
        contortion. He is aware that, unlike amphibians, snakes take longer to
        die and advises putting a drop of something stronger, like “aquafortis
        in the mouth, which stuns them well” (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/109v/f/109v/tl"><u>109v</u></a>),
        and “if you are in a hurry to cast, make him take through the mouth some
        good&nbsp;<em>eau-de-vie&nbsp;</em>or else mix a little with
        the&nbsp;vinegar. And soon it will be dead, without any lesion which

    <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion </h2>
    <p>As I read through Ms. Fr. 640, I am struck by the clear, evidence-based
        observations that are recorded purely in the interests of advancing the
        author-practitioner’s profession. Based on his frame of reference, some
        of his more conjectural remarks are completely defensible; others are
        somewhat less so—that is, until one realizes that a century before Ms.
        Fr. 640 was penned, another astute observer of nature, Leonardo da
        Vinci, was delving into fanciful tales and reflections on animals from
        iconographic material that he plumbed from the Medici library.<a
           href="#fn41"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref41"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>41</sup></a> In his old age, he amused
        himself by compiling these various passages into a bestiary of his own
        that, like the rest of his some 5,000 pages of manuscript, was never
        published.<a href="#fn42"

           id="fnref42"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>42</sup></a></p>
    <p>Likewise, the parenthetical interjections of the symbolic view of animals
        into what is essentially a down-to-earth shop manual might also be a
        reflection of an inquisitive and playful intellect. In any case, the
        manuscript presents us with a remarkable set of observations that
        provide insight into a sixteenth-century practitioner’s engagement with
        the natural world.</p>

                    It should be noted that Linnaeus lumped reptiles and
                    amphibians together into the single class “Amphibia.” In
                    1747, he also described toads as “these ugly animals.”<a

                    […] was very great, and they formed a part of the stores of
                    every fashionable apothecary’s dispensary. Supplies were
                    regularly sent in by the viper-catchers, and I remember
                    hearing a story of a large box full of these reptiles having
                    been received by one of these helpers of men in our town.
                    The lid was not properly secured, and the imprisoned
                    serpents wriggled out, finding their way up stairs, down
                    stairs, and in my lady’s chamber, and frightening the maids
                    and apprentices to death, some of whom found a viper or two
                    comfortably coiled up between the sheets, just as they were
                    about to step into bed.”<a href="#fnref24"

                    was so great that more than 800 per month were collected in
                    the decades of its maximum production. By the seventeenth
                    century, vipers had been virtually exterminated from the
                    Euganean Hills outside Padua, where they were traditionally

                    heightened understanding of ophidian scalation, in
