                describes one of the many processes of molding and casting in
                Ms. Fr. 640 that range from large, heavy weapons such as
                cannons, to small, delicate objects like flowers, insects, and
                even paper. This essay focuses on our close reading and hands-on
                reconstruction of casting “things too thin,” specifically,
                paper, pansies, and butterflies. We consider the properties of
                the various materials with which the author-practitioner
                experimented in order to add thickness to and strengthen
                delicate elements of these thin things. We also reflect on our
                own experience of learning to work with these materials
                according to their own dynamic characteristics.</p>

    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
    <p>The recipe “Molding grasshoppers and things too thin” on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/142v/f/142v/tl"><u>142v</u></a>
        is one of the many processes of molding and casting described in BnF Ms.
        Fr. 640 that range from large, heavy weapons such as cannons, to small,
        delicate objects like flowers and insects, and even paper. Indeed,
        throughout the manuscript, the author-practitioner is preoccupied with
        the scale of such objects and the challenge of casting them. Such
        delicate and ephemeral things as grasshoppers, butterflies, and flowers
        on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/142v/f/142v/tl"><u>142v</u></a>
        are associated with transience, and, in the case of butterflies, also
        bring to mind processes of metamorphosis. Judging by the number of
        entries on casting delicate, ephemeral objects in metal, the
        author-practitioner desired to transform and fix them into a more
        durable form.</p>
    <p>In many entries on casting delicate plants from life, he experiments with
        combinations of sands and binders that transform ordinary materials into
        carriers of the most delicate impressions. In the entry on fol. 142v, he
        discusses how to create the models from which to make the mold for metal
        and how to give these thin things enough substance to be cast, and how
        to most effectively create molds. These kinds of recipes in Ms. Fr. 640
        often focus on medal making and lifecasting, and they constitute a
        significant portion of the overall work.<a href="#fn1"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref1"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> Indeed, according to Smith and
        Beentjes, both types of casting “involve extensive knowledge of, and
        experimentation with, mold materials and metal alloys, and both aim for
        a very fine surface impression that demonstrates the maker’s expertise
        and virtuosity.”<a href="#fn2"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref2"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
    <p>In his investigations of sands and binders, and in these particular
        investigations in the entry on fol. 142v, the author-practitioner found
        it necessary to coordinate and combine diverse materials at different
        stages of molding and casting because objects of different sizes and
        densities require a variety of techniques and molding materials as well
        as different metals for casting. The author-practitioner’s instructions
        and observations in this entry reflect his knowledge acquired through
        experience and hands-on trial and error. Our reconstruction of the
        recipe for “things too thin” illuminates this underlying workshop
        rationale.</p>
    <p>This essay focuses on our reconstruction of casting “things too thin” on
        fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/142v/f/142v/tl"><u>142v</u></a>,
        specifically, paper, pansies, and butterflies. Through our
        reconstruction of these three things, we consider the role of the
        materials that the author-practitioner experimented with in order to add
        thickness to delicate elements and thus improve their “castability.”
        This particular entry is noteworthy for the fact that the
        author-practitioner discusses different methods for treating the
        delicate parts of animals and plants (i.e., wings of a grasshopper or
        butterfly, and pansy petals) prior to casting from life. This recipe on
        fol. 142v also connects to other recipes throughout the manuscript in
        which three particular materials are mentioned that serve to thicken
        “thin things”: butter, oil, and wax.<a href="#fn3"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref3"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> Interestingly, the
        author-practitioner contradicts himself about the efficacy of butter and
        oil,<a href="#fn4"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref4"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> and this inconsistency within the
        manuscript caught our attention. Hence, our exploration of its presence
        and significance informs our own experimental process in our
        reconstruction of casting the “thin things” from fol. 142v. Thus, this
        essay investigates ambiguities in the use and description of thickening
        agents. We explore different characteristics of these thickeners through
        close reading and hands-on reconstruction of the processes described on
        fol. 142v for molding paper, pansies, and a butterfly. Our exploration
        helps us to consider how the author-practitioner sought to reanimate the
        thin things he casts in metal. Our essay unfolds over three parts:
        molding paper, molding pansies, and molding a butterfly. Each section
        has two parts: our close reading and textual interpretation of the
        recipe, and our reconstruction.</p>
    <h2 id="paper-a-written-paper-to-mold-that-is-too-thin">Paper: “a written
        paper to mold that is too thin” </h2>
    <h3 id="interpretation">Interpretation</h3>
    <blockquote>
        <p>If you have a written paper to mold that is too thin, after you have
            made the first cast &amp; it has set, give a little thickness to the
            reverse of your paper with melted butter, which is the most
            appropriate means there is....</p>
        <p>[Note appearing in upper left margin:] If you write on paper or on
            common <em>carton</em> &amp; if your letter is of gum, the humidity
            of the clay slab or the wetted sand for <em>noyau</em> will moisten
            your letter &amp; undo it. Therefore write with cinnabar wetted with
            oil on oiled paper &amp; press in.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>In these passages from fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/142v/f/142v/tl"><u>142v</u></a>,
        the author-practitioner offers advice about how to create a piece of
        writing on paper that can be molded and subsequently cast in metal. The
        writing needs to withstand the wetness of the molding materials (packed
        clay or wet sand), and the paper must be given additional thickness.
        Both of these points address the challenge of protecting the model from
        the potential dangers arising during the molding process.</p>
    <p>We could find no other mention of techniques for molding paper among
        contemporary sources that address casting, such as Vannoccio
        Biringuccio’s <em>De la pirotechnia</em> (1540), Benvenuto Cellini’s
        treatises on goldsmithing and sculpture (1568), and Hugh Plat’s
        <em>Jewell House of Art and Nature</em> (1594). Given this lack of
        sources that might explain the recipe, we asked the following questions
        of Ms. Fr. itself, and particularly of the two entries on fols. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/131r/f/131r/tl"><u>131r</u></a>
        and 142v that treat the molding of paper:</p>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Why should writing be made of cinnabar mixed with oil, and
                    what kind of oil should be used?</p>
            </blockquote>
        </li>
        <li>
            <blockquote>
                <p>What kind of paper is used here, and how it should be
                    pretreated before molding?</p>
            </blockquote>
        </li>
        <li>
            <blockquote>
                <p>How can the written paper be molded and cast?</p>
            </blockquote>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>We began with writing on the paper. We
        reconstructed the two methods mentioned by the author-practitioner:
        writing with gum and writing with cinnabar mixed with oil. In his note
        on this section, he rejects the method that uses gum because the wetness
        of the molding material “will moisten your letter &amp; undo it.” Even
        so, gum appears to be an important material elsewhere in Ms. Fr. 640. It
        is mentioned in many recipes throughout the manuscript, most of which
        are pigment related, and the varieties called for include gum arabic,
        sandarac gum, gum amoniacum, and tragacanth gum. These different gums
        primarily function as water-soluble binding agents for pigment, and the
        term “gum water” (gum diluted with water) is used several times in
        recipes for pigments.</p>
    <p>To understand why the author-practitioner would be opposed to using gum
        for molding paper, we looked at the other references to gum in the
        manuscript. From these entries, we inferred that it was most likely the
        water solubility that made it an inadequate substance for this type of
        molding. But there is an entry on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/131r/f/131r/tl"><u>131r</u></a>,
        “Letters and molded paper” which calls for writing that uses “<em>ancre
            bien gommé</em>” (well gummed ink). This entry advises writing with
        well gummed ink, “or with any color which has body &amp; which does not
        erase once moistened with eau-de-vie.”<a href="#fn5"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref5"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
    <p>After examining the role of gum, we turned to consider the recipe’s use
        of cinnabar mixed with oil as a writing substance. What type of oil does
        the author-practitioner intend the reader to use? Many different oils
        appear in Ms. Fr. 640, including turpentine oil, walnut oil, linseed
        oil, and spike lavender oil, among others, which provide possibilities
        for the kind of oil he refers to on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/142v/f/142v/tl"><u>142v</u></a>.
    </p>
    <p>We then considered what type of paper to use, and what “oiled paper”
        might mean.<a href="#fn6"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref6"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> We used reconstructed early
        modern book paper that was already present in the Making and Knowing
        lab.<a href="#fn7"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref7"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
    <p>We turned next to the question of how to mold paper. Both entries
        apparently suggest a two-piece mold: fol. 142v mentions “the first
        cast”) and fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/131r/f/131r/tl"><u>131r</u></a>
        instructs to “cast on one side &amp; the other.” They both give
        instructions to “place your paper on a clay slab” (fol. 131r) and to
        “press in” (fol. 142v), then to “moisten it with eau-de-vie” (fol.
        131r). Fol. 142v adds extensive commentary on adding a thickening agent
        to thin things: “give a little thickness to the reverse of your paper
        with melted butter, which is the most appropriate means there is.” We
        concluded from these comments that the paper with writing on it should
        be molded in the same way as animals and plants are molded and cast from
        life, that is in two-piece molds, with a release agent applied to the
        model (the eau-de-vie), and delicate parts thickened with butter.</p>
    <p>This close reading of the entry for “Molding grasshoppers and things too
        thin” on fol. 142v provided us with information to design our hands-on
        reconstruction:</p>

        <li>
            <blockquote>

        </li>
    </ol>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>The first question we undertook to answer
        in our reconstruction was whether oiled paper can withstand the plaster

    <p>To determine the difference between oiled and non-oiled paper when it
        comes into contact with “wetted sand,” that is, liquid plaster, we
        placed two small pieces of paper, one without oil and one with oil
        applied to both sides, into wet plaster and left them there for five
        minutes (<i><u>Fig. 1</u></i>). The one without oil was completely wet
        with plaster clinging to the surface of the paper. In contrast, the
        oiled paper resisted the wet plaster, and its surface came out smooth
        with only a little plaster clinging to it (<i><u>Fig. 2</u></i>). Not
        surprisingly, the oil rendered the paper more water resistant.</p>

    <p>To determine which type of oil to use for this reconstruction, we
        investigated varnish and pigment entries and decided to use three types
        of oil: turpentine oil, wheat oil, and linseed oil. As a comparison, we

    <p>Our first experiment with ink and tragacanth gum powder came out
        precisely the same as Carlson and Katz’s experiment from Fall 2014. The
        gum is viscous when mixed with the ink. But no matter how much we
        stirred it, the mixed liquid remained sticky and uneven (<i><u>Fig. 8</u></i>). As a result (and just as Carlson and Katz found), it
        is hard to apply on the paper. Our reconstruction confirmed the
        author-practitioner’s assertion that this combination is not desirable,
        since the ink-gum mixture made our rendering of the Chinese character on
        the paper lumpy (<i><u>Fig. 9</u></i>), which we recognized would not
        cast well.</p>

    <p>Venice Red pigment and turpentine oil worked better than ink and gum. The
        pigment and the oil mixed with each other evenly (<i><u>Fig. 10</u></i>). When applied to the paper, this mixture did not rise very high off
        the paper, and it dried quickly. When dry, it began to flake off the
        paper (<i><u>Fig. 11</u></i>). Based on this, we determined this
        combination was not sticky and viscous enough for casting.</p>

    <p>Compared to the preceding two trials, Venice Red and wheat oil proved
        better. The pigment dissolved in the wheat oil very well. This mixture
        proved viscous enough to hold our Chinese character to the paper, and
        the pigment did not flake off when dry. When stirring this mixture with
        the paintbrush, we could feel its resistance against the brush much more
        than with the two preceding mixtures. When we lifted it with the
        paintbrush (<i><u>Fig. 12</u></i>), it clung to the paintbrush for about
        ten seconds, a sign of its viscosity (<i><u>Fig. 13</u></i>). The last
        mixture of Venice Red and linseed oil came out as well as the pigment
        and wheat oil combination, with almost the same viscosity (<i><u>Fig. 14</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 15</u></i>). We thus concluded that wheat
        oil or linseed oil are the best options. Their only disadvantage was
        that the character dried out much more slowly, and oil started to
        permeate the paper (visible on the left in Fig. 14).</p>

    <p>Our reconstructions enabled us to answer two questions: First, oiled
        paper can resist the wetness of the plaster. Second, pigment mixed with
        wheat oil or with linseed oil works better than with turpentine oil, and
        the ink and gum mixture is unsuitable for use in writing on paper for
        molding. When combined with Venice Red pigment, both wheat and linseed
        oils showed good consistency and viscosity, and created a convex surface
        to the writing, which appeared ideal for casting.</p>
    <p>Next, we turned to making a two-piece mold. To do this, we laid our paper
        with the Chinese character on a clay base and constructed a sprue system
        (to facilitate the flow of metal when it is poured into the mold), then
        we poured the plaster.<a href="#fn11"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref11"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> Forty minutes later, the plaster
        having set, we stripped off the clay wall and base and turned the mold
        over to prepare it for the second cast. Before this next cast, we
        followed the author-practitioner’s instructions on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/142v/f/142v/tl"><u>142v</u></a>
        to apply melted butter to the back of the paper in order to add to its
        thickness. Then we baked the mold, melting out the wax (<i><u>Fig. 16</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 17</u></i>). We then opened the mold to
        clean out the remaining wax in the gate and sprues (<i><u>Fig. 18</u></i>), and then luted it together (with a plaster mixture), and,
        finally, poured the metal (<i><u>Fig. 19</u></i>). When we opened
        the mold, we finally saw the outcome of our casting (<i><u>Fig. 20</u></i>). The metal failed to flow through the entire mold,
        however, it did show proof of concept, namely, that writing on paper
        could be molded and cast in a two-piece plaster mold by following the
        process on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/142v/f/142v/tl"><u>142v</u></a>.
        This failure was nevertheless productive because it drove us back to the
        manuscript to look for further information, which helped us in our
        following trials of molding and casting pansies and a butterfly.<a

    <p>In Ms. Fr. 640, the author-practitioner mentions three kinds of
        thickening agents for lifecasting. He explicitly excludes wax, likely
        because its melting point is between 62 and 65℃, and this heat could
        cause delicate plants to wilt. As the author-practitioner states on fol.
        <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/142v/f/142v/tl"><u>142v</u></a>,
        “wax would not be appropriate here for it is too hot once melted, &amp;
        it makes the thing to which it is applied contract.” Instead, he regards
        wheat oil as a proper choice because “wheat oil [...] is soon dry &amp;
        holds firm.” “Butter is amiable and handleable,” but it is not suitable
        for pansies and other flowers. He recommends butter, however, to “give a
        little thickness to the reverse of your paper [...] which is the most
        appropriate means there is, &amp; for fortifying the wings of either a
        butterfly or a grasshopper, or some delicate part of an animal to which
        you need to give thickness.”</p>
    <p>To understand better the effects of butter and wheat oil, we consulted
        several other recipes in the manuscript. In a marginal note appended to
        a recipe for making “Wheat oil” on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/110v/f/110v/tl"><u>110v</u></a>,
        the author-practitioner states,</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>If you want to mold something delicate, like a pansy, some, to give
            it a little thickness, more than what is natural, some rub it with
            butter. But it is best to anoint it with wheat oil, for it has no
            body, &amp; does not obstruct the small lineaments as much, and
            makes the flower firm.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>The author-practitioner prefers wheat oil
        over butter because it has no body, and thus does not cover over the
        delicate details of the flower. A recipe for “Molded roses” on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/129r/f/129r/tl"><u>129r</u></a>

        comments on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/142v/f/142v/tl"><u>142v</u></a>:

    <blockquote>
        <p>They [roses] are awkward to mold because the petals are very fine
            &amp; weak &amp; doubled. But, to <em>
                <del>obl</del>
            </em> avoid this, one needs to anoint them with wheat oil, which is
            very dessicative. And having quickly dried, it firms &amp; stiffens
            the petals to be able to separate them &amp; withstand the tempered
            sand. The same is done with flies, with pansies &amp; similar
            delicate things, with flowers from the caper plant.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>In a passage contradicting this on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/154v/f/154v/tl"><u>154v</u></a>
        entitled “Reinforcing flowers and delicate things,” however, he states
        that butter rather than wheat oil should be used to strengthen flowers:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>For flowers [<del>&amp;</del>] <del>delicate things</del> &amp;
            herbage, one does not use wheat oil but melted butter, of which one
            gives a light coat on the back of the petals of the rose flower
            &amp; the pansy &amp; other flowers that need it. But one reinforces
            the little legs of flies &amp; other small animals with wheat oil to
            strengthen them &amp; make them hold up.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>Despite these contradictions, we can
        conclude that wheat oil dries faster and holds firm, and it does not
        have the bulk (the “<em>corps</em>,” or body) of butter, thus preserving
        the delicate details of the plant.<a href="#fn19"

    <h3 id="reconstruction-1">Reconstruction</h3>
    <p>For this experiment, we used four pansies from the university campus
        flower beds to test the effects of butter and wheat oil. We split them
        into two groups:</p>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Group A: two white pansies to experiment with butter.</p>
            </blockquote>
        </li>
        <li>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Group B: two purple pansies to experiment with wheat oil.</p>
            </blockquote>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>We found it difficult to cover only the
        back of the petals, because once butter or wheat oil was applied to the
        back of one petal, the front side of another petal behind it immediately
        adhered to it. Both butter and wheat oil soaked through both sides of
        the petals. In Group B (wheat oil), the petals of the purple pansies
        became heavier after completely absorbing the oil, and they could no
        longer stand on their own. The petals also crumpled. The wheat oil,
        which was supposed to “dry quickly and hold firm,” exhibited the
        opposite effect (<i><u>Fig. 21</u></i>). In Group A (butter), the petals
        of the white pansies stiffened immediately after being coated on the
        underside with a fine layer of butter (<i><u>Fig. 22</u></i>). But this
        only lasted for 20 minutes, and, just as with the purple pansies, the
        petals on the white variety also drooped (<i><u>Fig. 23</u></i>). Given
        the time it took for the pansies to wilt, it is possible that the white
        pansies simply became dehydrated and withered on their own.</p>

    <p>Reflecting on our experiment, we hypothesized that our failure might be
        attributable to the characteristics of this cultivated pansy, which has
        large floppy petals in comparison to wild pansies. Therefore, for our
        second experiment we decided to use a different type of pansies with
        smaller and thicker petals, and we obtained a living plant from a local
        florist. We cut four flowers from this plant to experiment with and also
        split them into two groups:</p>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Group A: Two pansies to experiment with butter.</p>
            </blockquote>
        </li>
        <li>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Group B: Two pansies to experiment with wheat oil.</p>
            </blockquote>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>This time we heated the wheat oil a little
        bit to make it thinner and applied it to Group B when it had cooled to
        27℃. Unfortunately, it failed again, and by the time we finished
        building the infrastructure of sprues, the pansies had completely wilted
        and curled up (<i><u>Fig. 24</u></i>). We decided to give up
        experimenting with wheat oil and to try melted beeswax on the other
        pansy in Group B. This also proved problematic, as the beeswax
        solidified quickly, and we had to keep reheating it. It did not
        adversely affect the pansies, but it added a rather thick layer
        underneath the petals, which would cost some details when cast in metal
        (<i><u>Fig. 25</u></i>).</p>

    <p>As for Group A, butter worked well at first, and we could see clearly
        that the petals with a layer of butter were stiffer. But after the
        infrastructure of gate and sprues was built and a clay wall was rolled
        out and wrapped around the clay base, the buttered pansies wilted as
        well (<i><u>Fig. 26</u></i>). At this point, we realized that speed
        would be of the essence for a successful casting, a factor not
        referenced in the recipe but discovered through our own process of
        reconstruction.</p>

    <p>After our second failure, we decided to save time by not constructing the
        sprues attached to the petals. Based on our experiences during
        skillbuilding, metal would flow through the sprues with only three
        sprues attached to the gate.<a href="#fn20"

           id="fnref20"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> In this way, we were able to
        apply butter and wheat oil to the petals right before pouring the
        plaster. Judging from the final result, only the pansy with a wax
        coating worked effectively (<i><u>Fig. 27</u></i>), while the buttered
        pansy and the oiled pansy wilted and were distorted in the mold (<i><u>Fig. 28</u></i>). It could be that butter and wheat oil failed to
        make them strong enough to withstand the plaster or that the metal
        failed to fill the entire plant without the additional sprues.</p>

    <p>Our reconstruction showed both wheat oil and butter, which the
        author-practitioner recommended or discussed in different entries in the
        manuscript, to be unsuccessful. In contrast, wax, which the
        author-practitioner rejected, turned out to be a good material for
        thickening the pansy. However, while wax worked well as a thickening
        agent, it failed to capture the details of the petals, just as the
        author-practitioner suggested. That might be the reason he rejected wax,
        since the primary goal of molding thin things is to replicate precisely
        the fine details of the original object. In this sense, wax is not a
        good option.</p>
    <p>Our second unsuccessful reconstruction raised questions about the
        suitability of our reconstruction materials: according to the
        author-practitioner, wheat oil should dry fast when applied to the
        flower. In our case, however, the wheat oil had not yet dried when we
        poured the plaster. The author-practitioner recommends butter for the
        underside of petals, however, for us, it wilted and deformed the
        pansies. In 2008, however, Pamela Smith had successfully cast a pansy
        flower in silver that had been coated on the underside with butter (<i><u>Fig. 29</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 30</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 31</u></i>).<a

    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>Molding a butterfly appears to have been
        interesting to the author-practitioner because it poses a material and
        structural challenge, as this excerpt from fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/142v/f/142v/tl"><u>142v</u></a>
        and several other recipes for delicate things in his manuscript attest.
        The creatures he mentions for casting all possess diverse “surfaces.”
        For instance, he suggests molding lizards, snakes, crustaceans (such as
        crabs and crayfish), turtles, birds, bats, rats, and such insects as
        beetles, spiders, flies, and butterflies—he even provides a recipe for
        casting spider webs. In addition, as Pamela Smith has suggested, many of
        these creatures inhabited more than one elemental zone within the early
        modern view of the cosmos—the lizards, snakes, toads, frogs, and crabs
        live both on earth and in water, while insects and birds inhabited both
        air and earth. Significantly, many of the animals preferred for
        lifecasting—flies, beetles, frogs, snakes, and lizards—were also
        regarded as spontaneously generated from putrefying matter. Because of
        their liminal place between elemental zones and between processes of
        coming into being and passing away, these creatures were resonant with
        meaning in early modern culture.<a href="#fn22"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref22"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
    <p>The butterfly, too, was a meaningful creature: the butterfly transforms
        from caterpillar crawling the earth into a colorful winged insect that
        flies effortlessly in the air. Butterflies live only a short span. They
        symbolized both metamorphosis and impermanence in early modern Europe.
        As such, they fit well into the group of meaningful creatures used for
        molding and casting “things too thin;” however, the author-practitioner
        mentions none of this, straying explicitly into the symbolic meaning of
        an animal only once, in an entry for catching snakes on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/109r/f/109r/tl"><u>109r</u></a>–<a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/109v/f/109v/tl"><u>v</u></a>,
        where he notes,</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Also, I have noticed that when they [snakes] want to bite or eat
            something, they do not bite with a direct attack but with sinuous
            turns &amp; from the side, as do Satan &amp; his disciples. It has a
            small head but a very long body. The entryway to sin seems small
            &amp; inconsequential, but the consequences of it are very great.
        </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>He quickly moves on from his symbolic
        musings, however, to further observe of the snake:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>It abstains from eating seven or eight days, once it has devoured
            some frog. It can swallow three or four of them, one after the
            other, and what it devoured is neither corrupted nor consumed in one
            go in its stomach, but <em>
                <del>p</del>
            </em> some part little by little, that is to say bones and
            everything. And the remains are found as fresh as when it had
            devoured them, such that sometimes, when one presses &amp; torments
            it, it renders up what it has engulfed, parts of which are found
            totally consumed &amp; others as fresh as if it were alive. It can
            keep a frog engulfed for two to three hours &amp; renders it up
            completely alive (fol. <a
               href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/109v/f/109v/tl"><u>109v</u></a>).
        </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Similarly, in the entry on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/142v/f/142v/tl"><u>142v</u></a>,
        the author-practitioner focuses not on symbolic associations but on very
        practical techniques for molding those very thinnest of things—the wings
        of a butterfly. Given the brevity of the information about this
        subject—a single reference to the use of butter—we consulted related
        recipes in the manuscript.</p>
    <p>The butterfly has hairs on its body and fragile antennas. In addition to
        thickening the delicate parts, butter and wheat oil are supposed to help
        flatten the hairy parts of an animal, which can otherwise become
        difficult to manage. The author-practitioner mentions this several
        times. On fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/110v/f/110v/tl"><u>110v</u></a>
        he advises wheat oil “for anointing the hair of a butterfly or similar
        thing, for this oil is instantly dry &amp; makes the remainder dry out.”
        It is “necessary that the hair or down of any animal that you want to
        mold be flat, for being upright, it would elevate the sand &amp; become
        porous.” On fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/124r/f/124r/tl"><u>124r</u></a>,
        the entry entitled “Animals with hair and fragile and very thin flowers”
        addresses the problem of hairy creatures, mentioning butterflies again,
        and issuing a challenge:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Animals with hair are awkward to mold because the hair is raised
            &amp; is represented as though mixed up &amp; <em>
                <del>to</del>
            </em> clumped together. Starting, one ought to keep it flat with
            something dessicative &amp; that makes it firmer. And in this, the
            most singular thing is wheat oil, with which you will anoint it.
            Once cast, you will be able to repair it. The bodies of butterflies
            and plants that have a stem &amp; leaves which are wooly with a
            certain capricious &amp; downy hair, also need to be anointed with
            the same oil, to keep this down flat; likewise flowers that have
            very delicate &amp; thin leaves, for dry wheat oil makes them rigid
            and firm. And if someone brags about molding what is presented to
            them, give them to mold the downy head of the plant called dandelion
            or a pappus, which comes from the seeds of burdock &amp; flies away
            at the slightest sigh of wind.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>Similarly, on both fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/129v/f/129v/tl"><u>129v</u></a>
        in “Spider molded on a leaf,” and fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/130r/f/130r/tl"><u>130r</u></a>
        <strong>,</strong> he mentions using wheat oil to lay hairs down flat
        and make them firmer because they would otherwise become entangled in
        the plaster. On fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/152r/f/152r/tl"><u>152r</u></a>,
        in a densely written, full-page entry on “Molding a rat,” he runs
        through several different alternatives, noting in the margin that “all
        feathers &amp; all hair is awkward to mold according to its nature.” He
        first states that
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>the body should be anointed with wheat oil, which will keep the hair
            stiff &amp; couched, so that the sand will not raise it by getting
            entangled in it to prevent coming out neatly. The wheat oil being
            dry, which will be quick, you will be able to pass a very thin comb
            to divide it, in order that it appears in the cast. On a small
            mouse, you can even put some common oil to lower the hair.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>But he then turns to the opinions of
        others:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Some make the rat shed, others anoint it with olive oil, which is
            amiable, for wheat oil is thick &amp; has too much body. This is why
            one scarcely uses it, only to give some feature to a fly foot or
            under a wing to keep them rigid. Others couch the hair with an egg
            yolk, which is quickly dry &amp; amiable.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>In the margin of fol. 152r, he writes,
        “butter for anointing hairy animals is better <em>
            <del>e</del>
        </em> than wheat oil, because it is more amiable.” And, on <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/154v/f/154v/tl"><u>154v</u></a>,
        in “Reinforcing flowers and delicate things,” he returns once more to
        the problem:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>For flowers [<del>&amp;</del>] <del>delicate things</del> &amp;
            herbage, one does not use wheat oil but melted butter, of which one
            gives a light coat on the back of the petals of the rose flower
            &amp; the pansy &amp; other flowers that need it. But one reinforces
            the little legs of flies &amp; other small animals with wheat oil to
            strengthen them &amp; make them hold up.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>Despite contradictions, these comments
        establish some of the desirable characteristics of materials in molding
        and casting “things too thin”: quick drying is wanted, like that
        possible using wheat oil or egg yolk. Stiffening and firming is also
        needed to “strengthen” and make hairs more distinct. Amiability, which
        seems to mean something like “user friendly,” is also sought. Wheat oil
        does not seem to be amiable, while butter and olive oil are. In addition
        to its drying properties, wheat oil is useful for its lack of body,
        allowing delicate surface details to show through the coat of oil (fol.
        <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/142v/f/142v/tl"><u>142v</u></a>),
        but the author-practitioner contradicts this in molding a rat on fol.
        152r, where he maintains that “wheat oil is thick &amp; has too much
        body.”</p>
    <p>Our next concern in molding the butterfly was how to mold it: should it
        be done in a one-piece or two-piece mold? There are no detailed
        instructions about how to mold a butterfly in Ms. Fr. 640, so we studied
        other lifecasting entries. Animals, including lizards, crayfish, crabs,
        beetles, spiders, and flies, are generally cast in two-piece molds.
        Flowers, by contrast, are cast in one-piece molds. A rose is actually
        cast in two molds—the blossom in a one-piece mold and the leaves in a
        two-piece mold.<a href="#fn23"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref23"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a> A butterfly differs from other
        small creatures in its planar surfaces; it is in fact similar to paper
        with raised letters, thus it makes sense that the author-practitioner
        included it alongside instructions for molding paper on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/142v/f/142v/tl"><u>142v</u></a>.
    </p>
    <h3 id="reconstruction-2">Reconstruction </h3>
    <p>In casting the butterfly, we first tried a two-piece mold. After applying
        wheat oil to the wings and body of the butterfly, we laid it out on a
        piece of clay. We pressed the butterfly against the clay to affix it to
        the clay wall. Then we used four pins to pierce the edge of its wings in
        order to fix them onto the clay. However, after the application of the
        wheat oil, the butterfly’s wings seemed unable to resist the wetness of
        the oil and they became transparent and even more delicate. Moreover,
        the wheat oil failed to adhere to the clay, making it hard for the
        butterfly to rest flat on the clay. Finally, the pins tore the now even
        more delicate wings, and they disintegrated.</p>
    <p>After this first failure, we reconsidered the viability of a two-piece
        mold for casting a butterfly, but we also considered the state of the
        butterfly itself, as we had used a desiccated specimen from the gift
        store of the American Museum of Natural History (<i><u>Fig. 32</u></i>).

    </div>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>We were forced to think about how the
        dessicated state of the butterfly might have influenced the cast. The
        author-practitioner discusses how to catch, keep, and kill animals used
        for casting, repeatedly making the point that animals should generally
        be killed just before molding. For example, on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/110r/f/110r/tl"><u>110r</u></a>,
        he says about snakes, “one ought to put it to death only a quarter of an
        hour before you want to mold.” Similarly, flies should be used “as soon
        as you can after they are dead, because if you were to leave them to dry
        a lot, their legs would break when you want to spread them out” (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/156v/f/156v/tl"><u>156v</u></a>).
        A different strategy had to be used, however, for turtles and rats: for
        turtles, he notes that “One ought not to mold them as soon as they are
        dead because they are still too stiff. But on the following day, you
        will manipulate them &amp; fold their legs as you wish” (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/143r/f/143r/tl"><u>143r</u></a>),
        and for rats and mice, he advises on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/152r/f/152r/tl"><u>152r</u></a>
        to mold immediately after killing the animal or, if you cannot, hold off
        for a few days to let the animal soften again:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>And before molding these animals (except snakes &amp; lizards), let
            them <del>rest</del> remain dead one or two days to have them more
            handleable. For they stay rigid after their death &amp; cannot be
            well fitted to their true shape until they are a little softened.
            However, if you mold it quickly after it is dead, or give it its
            shape before it stiffens, you will do well.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>All creatures the author-practitioner uses
        in his casting appear to be freshly caught. Our butterfly was a
        specimen, purposely dried out in order to preserve it in its original
        form. We could not rehydrate it (as we did with beetles and spiders),
        since its wings were too fragile and brittle. As a result, the
        desiccated state of the butterfly—stiff and hard to manipulate—could not
        but adversely influence our casting.</p>
    <p>Based on what we learned about the butterfly’s fragility from our first
        trial, we decided to try a one-piece mold in order to reduce our direct
        physical contact with the insect. Having built a wax gate on the clay
        base to serve as both the channel into which the metal would be poured
        and as a support for the butterfly (<i><u>Fig. 33</u></i>), we used a
        pin to carefully pierce the belly of the butterfly and to fix it on the
        top of this gate. We then used melted wax to solidify the joint between
        its wings and body (<i><u>Fig. 34</u></i>), since our specimen was
        rather fragile and the wings could easily separate from the body. Since
        our preceding experiment of coating the butterfly with wheat oil failed,
        we tried melted butter both to flatten the hairy part of the body and to
        thicken the wings.</p>

    <h2 id="concluding-thoughts">Concluding Thoughts</h2>
    <p>In our last trial with butter, we gained important experience, as
        captured in our field notes:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Facing the melted yellowish butter in front of me, my mind was
            actually unsettled. My hands even start to tremble when I recall my
            last entanglement with butter, when we were molding the pansy. Using
            a paint brush, I carefully applied the lukewarm butter to the petals
            of the pansy. Like drawing a painting, brushstroke after
            brushstroke, the pansy was covered with butter. Then it began to
            die! The petals failed to withstand the weight of the butter. How
            frustrated! This time again, I have to face the butter. My last
            unpleasant encounter with it simply makes me afraid, but I have no
            other choice. This time, instead of applying the butter brushstroke
            after brushstroke, which is really time-consuming, I decided to do
            it fast in order to save time. I dipped my paintbrush into the
            melted butter for some time and then pulled it out. At the end of
            the brush there is a droplet of butter dangling and swaying. I then
            placed the brush right beyond the wings of the butterfly, and waited
            for the droplet to fall freely on the wings. Since the wings of the
            butterfly have a slight slope, the droplet of butter just fell and
            flew throughout the surface of the wings according to the declivity.
            The only thing I have to do is to blow the butter to flow more
            evenly through the surface of the wings and then to absorb redundant
            butter with paper towel at the lower end of the wings. And it works
            quite well! I was really excited about that. That moment is like a
            magic moment for me. It is like a sudden enlightenment disclosed
            through trials and errors. From this experience I learned that
            melted butter has its own life and trajectory, its own agency and
            habits. When encountering it, we must try to know more about its
            life and habits so that we can cooperate with each other.<a

        melted butter flow of its own accord, following the declivity of the
        wings, was to work with the physical characteristics and dynamic
        properties of the materials. At the same time, it permitted keeping
        physical contact with the fragile wings to a minimum, since the brush
        did not have to have contact with the wings, which could potentially
        damage them. In this sense, the butterfly, the wings with their slope in
        space, the paintbrush with drops of butter on it, and the flowing of the
        melted butter, all constituted an agentic assemblage, as defined by Jane
        Bennett:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>an assemblage owes its agentic capacity to the vitality of the
            materialities that constitute it. Something like this congregational
            agency is called <em>shi</em> in the Chinese tradition. <em>Shi</em>
            helps to ‘illuminate something that is usually difficult to capture
            in discourse: namely, the kind of potential that originates not in
            human initiative but instead results from the very disposition of
            things.’ Shi is the style, energy, propensity, trajectory, or élan
            inherent to a specific arrangement of things.<a href="#fn27"

    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>Our encounter with the melted butter in
        our reconstruction is an example of following the <em>shi</em> of the
        disposition and the propensity of materials; it is to listen to the
        things themselves, and to counteract our anthropocentrism in our
        interaction with matter. By encountering and interacting with materials
        on their terms, we start to get a sense of intimacy with them. Indeed,
        materials in our reconstructions certainly did not feel like dead and
        lifeless things; rather, as we puzzled over and struggled with them,
        they came to seem “vibrant matter”—as they also were for the
        author-practitioner.</p>
    <p>In the end, our experiences showed that melted butter could be a good
        material to thicken delicate things, as long as one works with it and
        its particular properties. Perhaps our bodily encounter with the melted
        butter can help to explain the author-practitioner’s seemingly
        contradictory statements about butter and wheat oil, as he notes in
        other molding and casting recipes that any material can be rendered
        good.<a href="#fn28"

        insists on the amiability of butter.</p>
    <p>For ourselves, as we followed a cycle of close reading, hands-on
        reconstruction, failure, close reading, and reconstruction again, we
        began to get a sense of how making and knowing are intertwined: how
        knowing can aid or hinder making, and how making can both reinforce
        established knowledge and bring new knowledge into being.</p>

                <p>Oiling paper is a waterproofing technique, as noted by Hugh
                    Plat, who recommends using oiled parchment rather than oiled
                    paper because it “will endure the blustering and stormy
                    weather much better than paper.” Scraping and oiling the
                    parchment makes it transparent so it can “serve in windows
                    instead of glasse” and will “keep the room very warm.” The
                    parchment can even be decorated to make a “pretty shew.”
