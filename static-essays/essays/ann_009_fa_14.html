                provides instructions to produce a liquid binder to be mixed
                with a dry powder for the making of sand molds. Recipes for
                “<em>Eau magistra</em>” and recipes that mention
                <em>magistra</em> in BnF Ms. Fr. 640 contain many different
                ingredients, including elm root, vinegar, salt water, glair of
                egg, and “good, pure wine.” It is not clear why some binder
                recipes in Ms. Fr. 640 are titled <em>magistra</em> while other
                binders, seemingly identical to them in function, are not
                denoted as such. The dry material, or “sand,” is sometimes
                described as “dry and lean,” thus requiring a wet or sometimes
                “fatty” substance to bind it together. This essay reconstructs
                the entry on fol. <a

                binary categories of fat and lean can be understood.</p>

        rock salt, moistened with tartar oil:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><em>Eau magistra</em></p>
        <p>Dissolve rock salt or <del>salt</del> finely pulverized sandiver
            &amp; put on marble in a cellar, &amp; it will dry out by reheating
            the mold, &amp; will give it a bond to withstand several castings.
            Try to moisten it with tartar oil.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>It is not clear why some binder recipes in Ms. Fr. 640 are titled
        <em>magistra</em> while other binders, seemingly identical to them in
        function, are not denoted as such. For example, on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/85v/f/85v/tl"><u>85v</u></a>
        the author-practitioner notes that founders use egg whites beaten
        together with earth to make molding sand for bell copes, as this “makes
        it come out <em>
            <del>d</del>
        </em> neatly, &amp; lays down &amp; settles the substance.” Nonetheless,
        the recipes for “<em>magistra</em>” and other binders in Ms. Fr. 640
        share some general similarities: they help bind the dry mold material in
        such a way that it allows a crisp impression of the pattern, releases
        the pattern, enables the sand to endure more than one casting, and
        allows easy release of the cast object.</p>
    <h2 id="fat-and-lean">Fat and Lean</h2>
    <p>The dry material, or “sand,” is sometimes described as “dry and lean,”
        thus requiring a wet or sometimes “fatty” substance to bind it together.
        For example, in describing sand made from ox foot bones in fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/84v/f/84v/tl"><u>84v</u></a>,
        the author-practitioner writes that “It molds on its own very neatly.
        But because on its own it is very arid &amp; lean, it wants to be well
        moistened &amp; dampened with wine boiled with elm root,” and in the
        margin, he writes, “A fatty metal needs lean sand.” On fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/85r/f/85r/tl"><u>85r</u></a>
        he recounts a successful mold material:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>once again lightly anointed it with clear walnut oil &amp; gently
            passed a linen cloth over it so that it does not remain too
            anointed, and I noted that, by this means, it would come out better
            in release, because the ceruse, once moistened with water of glair
            of egg, would not attach to the oil. This worked very well and I
            molded a medal of high relief very neatly, without any sticking,
            which a lot of good sands, such as felt, burnt bone &amp; iron
            dross, had failed to do on the first try. I reheated it &amp; my
            mold became hard like marble, and by this I knew that sands for
            molding high relief should be well moistened with some water, which
            gives them body &amp; compactness, such as glair, gummed water, <em>
                <del>ea</del>
            </em> wine boiled with elm root, &amp;c; and lightly oil the medal,
            it withstands as many castings as you wish, for it is as hard as
            glass.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>However, he then appears to reconsider, and goes on to say,</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Since then I have realized that this sand, even though it is
            excellent &amp; endures many castings &amp; molds very neatly,
            nevertheless is fatty and makes things porous. Thus, soft lead <del>
                and the</del> does not come out so well. But try to mix it with
            a lean sand, such as pumice, scales &amp; similar things to give
            them body &amp; so that they release better. For lean sands barely
            release well and yet they receive metal well.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>A search of Ms. Fr. 640 for <em>gras</em>
        (“fat,” “fatty”) and <em>maigre</em> (“lean”) reveals many instances.
        Our reconstruction of the recipe on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/84r/f/84r/tl"><u>84r</u></a>,
        in conjunction with these other instances in Ms. Fr. 640 of fat binders
        and lean sands, helped to illuminate the meaning of the categories “fat”
        and “lean” that scholars have identified in other early modern writings
        as an important aspect of the understanding of materials in early modern
        Europe.<a href="#fn1"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref1"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> Fat and lean were part of the
        system of qualities, similar to the Aristotelian categories of wet, dry,
        hot, and cold. They formed part of a “material imaginary” shared by the
        author-practitioner of Ms. Fr. 640 and other metalworkers. Our
        reconstruction of the “<em>Eau magistra</em>” recipe on fol. 84r showed
        that both dry and wet were used to support the terms lean and fatty.
        Moreover, our investigation revealed an unexpected sensory aspect to the
        property of “fattiness.”</p>
    <h2 id="reconstruction">Reconstruction</h2>
    <p>In order to test the “<em>Eau magistra</em>” recipe on folio <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/84r/f/84r/tl"><u>84r</u></a>,
        we first sought out <em>suin de verre</em>, or sandiver (also commonly
        referred to as glass gall), as the recipe stipulates.<a href="#fn2"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref2"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> Randle Cotgrave defines <em>suin
            de verre</em> as “sandever,” a “fatty substance floating on glass
        when it is red-hot in the furnace, and which being cold is as hard as
        stone, yet brittle, and easily broken.”<a href="#fn3"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref3"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> A nineteenth-century source
        defines sandiver as composed of “all those salts contained in common
        alkalis that readily melt at somewhat less than a glass-making heat, and
        are either naturally considerably volatile, or have little if any
        affinity for silex, and do not unite in the composition of glass, but,
        being superficially lighter, rise to the top.” Apparently this byproduct
        of glassmaking was “generally skimmed off with iron ladles, and sold to
        metal refiners as a powerful flux.”<a href="#fn4"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref4"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
    <p>In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, sandiver was used as an
        ingredient in <em>crocus metallorum</em> in addition to antimony and
        saltpeter for an alchemical recipe, as a pesticide for garden walks,
        where it “destroys both weeds and vermin,” and seems even to have been
        used in France for culinary purposes, “to powder their meat, and to eat,
        instead of common salt.”<a href="#fn5"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref5"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> In general, sandiver had multiple
        uses, as De Blancourt writes:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>this salt which the French call (Suin de Verre) Sandever is useful
            for several purposes, and in several Chymical Operations. It has
            besides some other Uses and Virtues that are not known, even to very
            few of the Learned; I could tell some very surprising and wonderful
            uses of it. But this may serve to whet the Industry of, and excite
            the Curious to further Enquiries.<a href="#fn6"
               class="footnote-ref"
               id="fnref6"
               role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Our search for sandiver as “glass gall” revealed this to be an obsolete
        material, impossible to obtain in modern glass making due to
        standardization and quality control of ingredients which ensure that
        byproducts such as sandiver do not result from production. A toxic
        product called “sandiver” is still produced in glass recycling. However
        it is now defined as the contaminants—such as asbestos—that result from
        the recycling of waste glass and which must be separated from the glass
        mass in the furnace in order to produce usable glass.<a href="#fn7"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref7"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
    <p>Thus, with no feasible way to obtain sandiver for the <em>magistra</em>
        experiment, we decided instead to follow the recipe’s suggestion to use
        rock salt in place of sandiver. Sandiver and rock salt seem to have been
        seen as interchangeable or at least related in some processes—in
        “<em>Eau magistra</em>” on fol. 84r, as well as for an
        eighteenth-century author who suggested in <em>Van Nostrand’s
            Engineering Magazine</em> that for “pig or sow iron, videlicet, the
        ashes of wood and other vegetables, all kinds of glass and sandiver,
        common salt and rock salt” be mixed into the iron mass to purify it.<a
           href="#fn8"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref8"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
    <h2 id="molds-to-withstand-many-castings">Molds to Withstand Many Castings
    </h2>
    <p>sandiver and rock salt are suggested as dry binding materials in more
        than one recipe in Ms. Fr. 640, where the author-practitioner comments
        on the strength of the molds they produce. For example, the recipe
        titled “Sand from a mine in Thoulouse” on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/84r/f/84r/tl"><u>84r</u></a>
        lists sandiver as an ingredient in the sand which will make it withstand
        several castings:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>The sand from Thoulouse, which is taken, from the depths of the
            earth, from the small hill of Puy David, is excellent in itself, but
            to make it withstand several castings, I mix it with pulverized
            sandiver &amp; moistened, which hardens it, &amp; takes body &amp;
            bond with it, &amp; makes it withstand <del>more than five</del> as
            many castings as you wish. Try to moisten the pestled glass and
            other <em>
                <del>e</del>
            </em> sands with the waters of the aforesaid salts. It wants to be,
            like all natural sand, well reheated before putting it to use.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>The “<em>Eau magistra</em>” recipe, also
        on 84r, likewise specifies that the resulting mold should be strong
        enough to withstand several castings. Similarly, the recipe on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/89r/f/89r/tl"><u>89r</u></a>,
        which calls for mixing together pulverized ox bone and rock salt then
        moistening them in a damp place, is said to have withstood many
        castings.</p>
    <p>To reconstruct the process on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/84r/f/84r/tl"><u>84r</u></a>,
        we ground rock salt, mixed it with oil of tartar,<a href="#fn9"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref9"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> then mixed it with a dry sand
        composed of reground molds from previous casting (made from pulverized
        brick and plaster). When mixed with the <em>eau magistra</em> of fol.
        84r, this recipe produced a two-piece mold that, despite some crumbling
        and partial disintegration, remained intact enough for a second clean
        casting (<i><u>Fig. 1</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 2</u></i>, <i><u>Fig.
                3</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 4</u></i>). We cannot decisively conclude
        from this single trial<a href="#fn10"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref10"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> that the <em>magistra</em> of
        fol. 84r was responsible for the success of this mold, however, our
        investigation of the ox bone and rock salt recipe on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/89r/f/89r/tl"><u>89r</u></a>
        also produced an unexpectedly hard mold that was firmly bound together
        and remained intact enough to be cast more than once.<a href="#fn11"

    <p>These two recipes specify rock salt or sandiver mixed with the dry sand
        material. Thus, the salt forms a “dry binder” for the sand, rather than
        a wet binder such as elm root infusions and egg whites.<a href="#fn12"

           id="fnref12"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> The binding action occurs when
        the salt mixture is moistened. The “fatty” property of rock salt or of
        sandiver remedies the “lean” properties of the dry mold. The
        author-practitioner makes this explicit when he writes in a recipe for
        sand made from sal ammoniac and alabaster powder that “ammoniac is fatty
        and <em>
            <del>a va</del>
        </em> is nevertheless sandy, which makes it release well. There is no
        better bond than salts appropriate for metals, for once mixed in powder,
        they get moistened together &amp; dry &amp; reheat together” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/89v/f/89v/tl"><u>89v</u></a>).

    <h2 id="the-sensory-experience-of-fat-and-lean">The Sensory Experience of
        Fat and Lean</h2>
    <p>How can salt be understood as “fatty”? In our reconstructions of the
        recipes on fols. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/84r/f/84r/tl"><u>84r</u></a>
        and <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/89r/f/89r/tl"><u>89r</u></a>,
        we struggled with the concepts of fat and lean, as they did not make
        sense within a modern understanding of salts, much less of “fat.” We
        began to understand the meaning of fat and lean, however, when we ground
        rock salt for both the “<em>Eau magistra</em>” of fol. 84r and ox
        bone-rock salt sand of fol. 89r (<i><u>Fig.5</u></i>, <i><u>Fig.
                6</u></i>). After grinding the salt in granite mortars as finely
        as possible and storing it in an airtight jar, we returned to the lab a
        few days later and found that the texture of the salt was very “sticky.”
        The salt had transformed from a fine, dry powder that poured freely from
        an outstretched hand to a sticky substance, in which the particles
        clearly adhered to each other, creating an unexpected sensation of
        resistance when running one’s fingers along the surface. The familiar
        material of salt unexpectedly possessed a completely different set of
        properties, and we <em>felt</em> the “fattiness” of the rock salt, which
        also afforded a new workability for our molds. This allowed us to
        apprehend the place of “fatty” in the “material imaginary” of the
        author-practitioner,<a href="#fn13"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref13"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> and it allowed us a rather
        different perspective than is given by our modern classification of salt
        as sodium chloride.</p>

                to smaller particles released the “fatty” property of the salt?

    <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>We concluded that paying attention to the framework of qualitative
        binaries such as fat and lean can help us understand the early modern
        experience of materials in relation to the practitioner’s body: the
        material properties of hot, dry, wet, cold, fatty, and lean also
        described the characteristics and temperaments of human bodies, and
        early modern people thought about their bodies and their selves as
        needing to be tempered and balanced by ingesting materials and foods of
        opposing qualities. Materials had their own characters, with likes and
        dislikes, and they, too, needed to be balanced and tempered in similar
        ways (and sometimes with the same types of remedies). Moreover, as the
        primary tool in the workshop, the human body worked in collaboration
        with and in reaction to the materials. Materials were often tasted,
        smelled, listened to, and handled to determine their wants and needs.<a
           href="#fn14"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref14"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> In addition, the fluids of the
        body often became materials themselves—urine, phlegm, even the “white
        thick saliva that is found on the teeth” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/134v/f/134v/tl"><u>134r</u></a>)—were
        used in the work. And, materials, such as the fumes from metals, were
        known to penetrate the bodies of those who worked on them. These
        analogies and intersections between human body and natural materials
        fostered the view that the microcosm of the human body functioned as a
        part of and in concert with the macrocosm of nature. Sensory
        apprehension, in this view, could consist in a resonance between the
        body and the materials it worked. Observation thus meant not only paying
        attention to the materials, but also being alert to the sensations of
        one’s own body.</p>
