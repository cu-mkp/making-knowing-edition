        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <div>
            <p>By focusing on the translation of the entries on molding and
                casting turtles from life in BnF Ms. Fr. 640, this essay seeks
                to underscore and bring to light the chronology, choices, and
                processes behind the Project’s translation of the manuscript.
                Our translation serves two main goals: to accurately represent
                the author-practitioner’s intentions and voice, as unhindered as
                possible by twenty-first-century assumptions, and to provide a
                window onto the vivid world described in the manuscript.</p>

    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>In the fall of 2013, a call for
        applications went out from Pamela Smith, Seth Low Professor of History
        at Columbia University and Founding Director of the Making and Knowing
        Project, asking for paleographers who might be interested in
        participating in a Middle French Paleography Workshop the following
        June. This workshop was the first in a series of broader “Text
        Workshops,” tasked with the transcription, translation, and markup of
        BnF Ms. Fr. 640 for digital publication. Moreover, these workshops had
        been conceived as one of several components of the Making and Knowing
        Project.<a href="#fn1"

    <p>The authors of this article, one an art historian, the other a
        medievalist, met and struck up a fruitful working partnership at the
        first workshop, and found themselves returning every year to participate
        in the transcription and translation of the manuscript, eventually
        narrowing their focus down to the translation of the metal casting
        entries (<i><u>Fig. 2</u></i>). In this essay, we hope our two voices
        will represent those of the forty-nine paleographers who worked on Ms.
        Fr. 640’s digital edition. We will be using the first person as a means
        to acknowledge our own agency in this process as well as the subjective
        nature of any translation work. Similar to the way other essays might
        take the reader into the “workshop” (<em>boutique</em>) of the
        author-practitioner, this essay was very much written as a way to guide
        the reader into the “workshops” that produced the digital edition.</p>

    <p>Ms. Fr. 640, with an accepted date of the last quarter of the sixteenth
        century, fits into a wider literary genre of technical “how-to”
        literature, one of the earliest examples being <em>Il libro
            dell’arte</em> (ca. 1400) by Cennino Cennini.<a href="#fn3"

           id="fnref3"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> The fifteenth and sixteenth
        centuries saw a great number of these kinds of treatises being written,
        among the more well known <em>De la pirotechnia</em> by Vannoccio
        Biringuccio in 1540 (<i><u>Fig. 3</u></i>), <em>‘Li tre libri dell’arte
            del vasaio</em> by Cipriano Piccolpasso in 1548, <em>Di Secreti</em>
        by Alessio Piemontese in 1555, <em>De re metallica</em> by Georgius

    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>Beyond the anomalous example above,
        translators often neglected to make their editorial decisions explicit.
        This is a recurring pattern that can be found in many of the
        translations of how-to literature, the major exception being Lara
        Broecke’s recent edition of <em>Il libro dell’arte</em> in which she
        explicitly addresses the “excruciating English” sometimes found in her
        translation of Cennini’s work, underlining that she wants to “reflect
        Cennino’s writing difficulties in [her] own writing.”<a href="#fn11"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref11"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> Broecke addresses issues of
        structure in the original text, punctuation, choice, and consistency of

    <p>When translating these types of books, a translator, in general, is
        necessarily confronted with having to make decisions in terms of
        vocabulary, syntax, audience reception, and comprehension. However, when
        translation moves from singular scholar to several, as with the Making
        and Knowing crowd-sourced text workshops, a different working method is
        required. Since the practice of translation has traditionally been a
        solo endeavor, a translator will often make decisions without
        articulating the reasoning behind them; and the reader may only be able
        to intuit these decisions retrospectively through the implicit evidence
        of the text itself. That a given translator chooses one option over
        another is not always made apparent, nor is it expected to be made so.
        For the translation of Ms. Fr. 640, however, the Making and Knowing team
        was forced to bring the decision making into the open and to provide an
        opportunity for iterative and interactive exchange. In this way, a
        series of guidelines and practices developed and were documented
        throughout the workshops, henceforth referred to as the “translation
        protocols.”&nbsp;</p>
    <p>This essay is structured around the division of the text workshops into
        two phases: the first three, in which the transcription of Ms. Fr. 640
        was completed and an initial translation was made; and the last two,
        when the translation process materialized into a codified set of
        protocols that both drove the translation process thereafter and shaped
        the finalized digital edition. In the first phase, the translators did
        not enter into the task with a high sense of self-reflection, nor were
        they inclined to document their decisions. In the second phase, however,
        with a heightened awareness of the collaborative environment and its
        consequences, the thinking behind the translation process shifted.
        Sharing authorship of the translation also meant sharing ownership, and
        provided a more objective perspective that made all participants
        answerable to a third entity, the translation protocols themselves. In
        addition to the organic evolution of the protocols, the freedom from
        singular ownership of the translation and the growing awareness of
        significant elements in the author-practitioner’s voice meant that a
        distinctive translation was produced. In practical terms, this means
        that the reader of the English translation of Ms. Fr. 640 might be
        surprised, at times, by the choices made. In this essay, we explicitly
        articulate the protocols and principles used in translating Ms. Fr. 640
        into English, and document the translation process in a transparent
        manner, explaining why the translation appears in the format that it
        does.&nbsp;Because we worked mostly with casting entries, specific
        examples come from the process of lifecasting, particularly those of
        turtles and tortoises.<a href="#fn13"

        haste …”.<a href="#fn14"

    <h2 id="the-hare-the-first-three-workshops">The Hare:&nbsp;The First Three
        Workshops</h2>
    <p>In looking back at the development of the translation protocols, the
        first three workshops (2014, 2015, and 2016) form a cohesive unit based
        upon the most immediate objective at that time, namely the transcription
        and initial translation of certain manuscript entries for the following
        fall and spring laboratory seminars.<a href="#fn15"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref15"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> In the spirit of the Making and
        Knowing ethos, experimentation played a key role in the first three
        years, by guiding both the day-to-day workflow and the development of a
        digital infrastructure held in a dedicated Google Drive folder.</p>
    <p>When the first workshop got underway, project directors and paleographers
        created a daily workflow that included collaboration in both formal and
        organic ways. In formal group morning meetings, the paleographers
        benefited from the expertise and knowledge of others to create a shared
        understanding of certain vocabulary and artisanal processes, such as
        casting in wax and making imitations. The large group meetings also
        provided a venue to discuss the previous day’s methodological questions
        and problems, including specific concepts and vocabulary the
        author-practitioner describes in the manuscript (<i><u>Fig. 5</u></i>).
        After the morning meetings, work continued in groups of two, each
        including French and English native speakers (<i><u>Fig. 6</u></i>). In
        order to divide the work up efficiently, each pair was assigned a
        certain number of pages from the manuscript, and tasked with updating an
        already semi-completed diplomatic transcription, creating a normalized
        transcription from it, and finally updating a minimally-completed
        translation.</p>

    <p>With no other specific instructions, each working group experimented
        organically with its own style and process. We developed what was later
        revealed as a singular working method involving one of us reading aloud
        from the semi-complete transcription while the other read along with the
        manuscript facsimile page to verify and update the transcription text.
        When anomalies occurred, we conferred with the manuscript, made an
        executive decision, and updated the transcription. Likewise for
        translation, while one of us read the partially-prepared translation out
        loud, the other followed along in the newly-created normalized
        transcription to confirm and update the translation text. Once the
        translation was complete, we then reread it with an eye to rendering it
        as fluently as possible, often imagining ourselves in the position of
        the student trying to carry out the written instructions. In retrospect,
        it was a “principle of student comprehension” that drove the initial
        phase of translation in the first three workshops. Given the nature of
        the working environment—everyone was working in Fayerweather Hall
        throughout the day—informal conversations also took place between
        various groups to see how others were transcribing or translating
        unfamiliar words.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The general workflow was closely linked to the Google Drive
        infrastructure that had been set up for the paleographers. The
        manuscript was divided into units of pages, not units of entries. As a
        result, in the first three workshops, each group was assigned a certain
        number of pages and worked through the entire page, even when the
        entries on it had no relation to one another. For example, on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/10r/f/10r/tl"><u>10r</u></a>,
        the author-practitioner moves from how to make imitation jasper to
        making hourglass sand (<i><u>Fig. 7</u></i>). The Google Drive, too, was
        organized according to manuscript page number, each page having an
        individually-named folder that contained the facsimile image, the
        diplomatic/normalized transcriptions and translation documents (<i><u>Fig. 8</u></i>). Once a folder, i.e., a page, had been completely
        updated, the paleographers placed their initials in the title of the
        folder, indicating it was ready for revision by Marc Smith and Pamela
        Smith. Progress was measured by looking at the number of folders that
        had initials next to them, indicating they were complete.</p>

    <p>The first three workshops intentionally provided the space and scholarly
        support to experiment with collaborative workflows. Only through the act
        of transcribing and translating did the team of directors and
        paleographers begin to understand how best to accomplish the task at
        hand.&nbsp;Different groups practiced different workflows and this led
        eventually to a general methodological approach and a complete and
        accurate transcription of the manuscript (<i><u>Fig. 9</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 10</u></i>). It also led, however, to the realization that
        while the initial translation objectives had been achieved, i.e., the
        “principle of student comprehension,” the translations as a whole were
        sorely lacking consistency. The experiential and experimental nature of
        the first three workshops had produced different translation voices.
        Dotted throughout were a variety of English idioms, grammatical
        structures, and vocabulary applied to identical French phrases and
        words. If one of the strengths of the project had been the vast array of
        specialized knowledge the participants brought to the manuscript; the
        drawback was the very distinct, sometimes isolated translations that
        this knowledge produced.</p>

    <h2 id="the-tortoise-a-slow-haste-in-the-last-two-workshops">The Tortoise: A
        Slow Haste in the Last Two Workshops</h2>
    <p>Over the course of the last four days of the 2016 workshop, a small group
        of participants who had attended all three up to that point, and who
        were therefore familiar with the questions and challenges that
        translating raised, gathered together to brainstorm and design an
        effective collaborative methodology in line with a new translation
        objective. The outcome of these four days resulted in a new workflow
        that would “consistify” the translation, as well as create standardized
        documentation for use by all translators.</p>
    <p>For the following two years, the workshop took place in Toulouse, at the
        Université Jean Jaurès. From ongoing research on Ms. Fr. 640, it had
        been discovered that the manuscript was in all likelihood written by an
        author-practitioner who worked in or near Toulouse, and moving the
        workshops there offered the participants, as well as the Making and
        Knowing team, an opportunity to gain insight into the manuscript’s
        environment. While this did not impact the translation process directly,
        we were able to gain insight into the processes, places, and materials
        that the author-practitioner described in Ms. Fr. 640, and we were
        greatly indebted to the expertise of Pascal Julien, Professor of Art
        History, Colin Debuiche, and Sarah Muñoz on Renaissance Toulouse. We
        toured contemporary buildings, the city at large, as well as museums (<i><u>Fig. 11</u></i>). We visited marble quarries and a woad museum (<i><u>Fig. 12</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 13</u></i>). Knowing that we were
        working in the same milieu as the author-practitioner was inspiring and
        created a great sense of motivation and interest among the team.</p>

    <p>By 2017, the paleography team consisted only of experienced
        paleographers, i.e., people who had already participated in one or more
        of the previous workshops. We all knew each other quite well and by that
        time were all deeply engaged and committed to finishing the translation.
        It had become a joy to work for a few weeks a year on this project, with
        a dedicated group that took pleasure in meeting up and seeing each other
        (<i><u>Fig. 14</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 15</u></i>). This working environment
        meant that we felt comfortable asking questions, providing critical
        feedback, and exchanging information. In other words, the team really
        coalesced into a very efficient and congenial working environment that
        not only offered mutual understanding but constantly encouraged new
        solutions to problems that came up. It was within this new environment
        that the new translation workflows and protocols were put into practice.

    <p>The new workflow, which included the transparent documentation of
        explicit translation protocols, in effect underscored three theoretical
        outcomes that emerged as translation progressed. First, just as the
        “making” that happened in the laboratory seminars enhanced the “knowing”
        of the manuscript entries, new translation groups acquired a more
        refined “knowing” of a process through the “making” of its translation.
        For example, in order for us to understand the “Molding turtles” entry,
        we had to work through our own “making” of the process over several
        attempts (<i><u>Fig. 16</u></i>). Second, it became evident that the
        translations depended not only on understanding the sixteenth-century
        vocabulary and grammar of the author-practitioner, but also on
        understanding his work, his goals, and his cultural and physical
        environment. In addition, paying attention to the preservation of the
        agency of language used by the author-practitioner took on greater
        importance. Third, the team decided to keep the translation as close to
        French syntax as possible, guided by the strong belief that we should
        not impose twenty-first-century concepts onto a sixteenth-century text,
        but rather work to capture the voice of the author-practitioner.</p>

    <p>The first changes in the workflow applied to group composition and tasks.
        The translators shifted from working in pairs, to working in groups of
        three, always including at least one native speaker of English (<i><u>Fig. 17</u></i>).<a href="#fn16"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref16"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> In order to build expertise
        within each group, the manuscript was divided up into entries, as
        opposed to the previous division of pages, so that each group could
        focus on a single theme rather&nbsp;than a linear progression by page
        number.<a href="#fn17"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref17"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> A parallel shift in digital
        infrastructure occurred with the creation of a spreadsheet by then
        Project Manager Naomi Rosenkranz that tracked the progress of completed
        entries <i><u>(Fig. 18</u></i>). In this way, each group was able to
        become an “expert” in the translation of certain processes, such as
        casting or painting, following the entries throughout the manuscript and
        making sure that the translation was consistent across all of them (<i><u>Fig. 19</u></i>). Our work with the casting entries allowed us to
        make consistent decisions, such as keeping <em>crocum ferri</em> in
        Latin instead of using the previous translation of “iron dross.”
        <em>Platine d’ardille</em> was consistently translated as “clay slab,”
        replacing other translations such as “clay base,” and <em>luther</em>
        became “to lute,” instead of “cover with clay,” among other
        translations.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>The shift in workflow was accompanied by the formalization and
        standardization of project resources. First, a general vocabulary list
        was generated for everyone to consult, including protocols for variants
        of spelling and function, citations for references, and page number
        examples (<i><u>Fig. 20</u></i>).<a href="#fn18"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref18"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> This list was to be consulted
        for entry-specific vocabulary and for certain recurring words, and
        formed the basis for what is now the <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/1r/f/1r/glossary"><u>Glossary</u></a>.
        For example, words such as <em>après</em> and <em>car</em> were given a
        consistent translation in English: “next” and “for.” Likewise, a
        distinction was made between <em>puis</em> and <em>ainsi</em>, which
        became “then” and “thus,” respectively. <em>Advise bien</em> was
        winnowed down from four different translations to one: “take heed.” The
        vocabulary list garnered its own set of best practices for making
        entries and became indispensable for creating consistency among the
        translation voices. Second, a default line was drawn for translating
        French vocabulary and expressions when faced with a variety of options
        in English: stick as closely to the French as possible. For example, a
        <em>pointe de fer</em> in French became an “iron point,” rather than the
        previous translation of “iron needle.” While the meaning of iron needle
        is perfectly correct when translating <em>pointe</em>, it inferred too
        much information on the size and shape of the object, layers of
        interpretation that were not explicit in the French.</p>

    <p>In practice, the thematic translation groups, because they focused on one
        type of technique, were able to develop expertise on translating a
        particular type of entry: whether in terms of technique, materials used
        by the author-practitioner, or, more importantly, in terms of language
        used to express these techniques. An example of this came with the
        understanding of the word <em>gect</em>, which had two different
        meanings that had sometimes been conflated. We had previously translated
        the word <em>gect</em> as “casting,” as in the verb “to cast” for
        <em>gecter</em> (<em>jeter</em>). This was clearly a comprehension
        problem on our part that only resolved itself after having translated a
        series of casting entries and gaining a contextual understanding. On
        fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/125v/f/125v/tl"><u>125v</u></a>
        in “Molding turtles,” the first set of translations from 2014–2016 show
        a lack of understanding about the process taking place: “To cast in
        sugar without making a casting, they are molded from plaster, as works
        for anything you like.”&nbsp;(<em>Elles se moulent de plastre pour
            gecter en sucre sans faire gect comme font toutes choses que tu
            vouldras.</em>) Here <em>gecter</em> was translated as “casting.”
        But as our expertise in the casting process grew, and our understanding
        of these entries sharpened, it became clear that <em>gect</em> did not
        always mean “cast,” but sometimes referred to a “gate,” the entryway for
        the hot metal to enter the mold, usually made out of wax. The use of
        “gate” clarifies the process, and various illustrations show the
        author-practitioner making channels, or gates, of wax for casting (<i><u>Fig. 21</u></i>).</p>

    <p>The final translation therefore reflects a more accurate understanding of
        the techniques and vocabulary at work: “They are molded in plaster to be
        cast in sugar without making a gate like done for all things that you
        want.” With this new understanding of <em>gect,</em> we could make
        choices in translation that were consistent across all entries from this
        group according to context. Similarly, the fact that teams were working
        thematically provided a deeper and broader contact with the entries
        included within a category: so broad that connections between them that
        had not been made beforehand were still being uncovered in the 2018
        workshop. For the turtles entries in particular this meant the discovery
        that the “Molding hollow” entry on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/150v/f/150v/tl"><u>150v</u></a>
        was actually a direct continuation of “Molds” from the previous folio,
        even though its title had no direct link to it. The initial translation
        of both entries was confusing in terms of the processes described in
        each, as we were not aware that the text continued on from a previous
        page. Being able to connect fols. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/150v/f/150v/tl"><u>150v</u></a>
        and <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/150r/f/150r/tl"><u>150r</u></a>
        within their wider structure vastly improved our translation, as well as
        our understanding of the “Molding turtles” group of entries.</p>
    <p>The expertise that was being developed by the paleography teams happened
        iteratively and often through the consultation of a very wide range of
        sources and experts. In translating the casting recipes, we often turned
        to videos in order to gain a visual understanding of the process. For
        example, a video of early twentieth-century practitioners illustrated
        how bells were cast and helped to clarify the processes of certain
        casting entries in Ms. Fr. 640.<a href="#fn19"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref19"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a> Then, partly on the basis of the
        translation work done with the casting entries, the Making and Knowing
        team created their own video showing the lost-wax casting process that
        helped the paleography team integrate the techniques into further
        translation work. We also relied on the wide range of research expertise
        held by the project members themselves: among them Pamela Smith’s
        understanding of casting processes, Tillmann Taape’s knowledge of
        medical history, and Tianna Uchacz’s expertise on Netherlandish art.
        Expertise was also sought by the project team during the working group
        meetings. In addition to these meetings, experts in various domains were
        also called to assist the translation team, especially for the arms and
        armor entries (<i><u>Fig. 22</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 23</u></i>). The
        vocabulary for these entries was very technical and specific and
        required the help of Jonathan Tavares, Associate Curator of Arms and
        Armor at the Art Institute of Chicago, and Pascal Brioist, Professor of
        History at the University of Tours, who were able to explain the nature
        of the entry content and its importance in the manuscript and the field
        as a whole (<i><u>Fig. 24</u></i>).</p>

    <p>The guiding principle of holding true to the French syntax, structure,
        and grammar led to two important consequences. First, the use of
        cognates increased throughout the translation. Indeed, the list of
        cognates became wide-ranging: for example, “corrupt” was used for
        <em>corrompre</em> rather than “spoil,” and “adapt” for <em>adapter</em>
        instead of “arrange.” Second, fidelity to the French syntax&nbsp;became
        an essential tool when trying to translate the agency of materials and
        processes described by the author-practitioner. For example, the often
        used <em>boire</em>—when meant to describe a material absorbing a
        liquid—was initially translated as “to absorb.” However, this
        translation removed the agency of the material, which was no longer
        actively interacting (drinking) with another, but instead passively
        reacting to it (absorbing). To preserve the understanding of materials
        held by the author, the new translation was amended to “to drink.”
        Another example can be found on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/144v/f/144v/tl"><u>144v</u></a>:
        “S’il y a du crocum dans le sable les joinctures des molles ne se
        <strong>cognoissent</strong> presque point.” Here, initially
        <em>connaitre</em> was translated as “will not join well.” This conveyed
        the meaning of the word in context, but in 2018, this was changed to:
        “If there is some <em>crocum</em> in the sand, the joints of the molds
        will almost not recognize each other” in order to preserve the implied
        agency of the reflexive. After a consideration of all instances of
        <em>connaitre</em> across the manuscript, the translation changed again
        to “If there is some crocum in the sand, the joints of the molds can
        hardly be perceived.” While this translation decision in the end
        resulted in a passive construction in English, on the same folio, in
        another passage of the “Molding turtles” entry, notions of “agency” or
        “embodiment” were preserved. When discussing how to prepare a mold, in
        order for it to release well, the author-practitioner specifies, “L’eau
        chaulde faict que le sable destrempé en eau s’assoit mieulx sur l’huile,
        qui aultrement <strong>refuseroit</strong>.” Initially
        <em>refuseroit</em>, which implies a certain will on the part of the
        material—in this case the sand, was translated as “would not work,” the
        literal translation of the consequence of that refusal. In the second
        round of translation, however, this was changed to: “hot water makes the
        tempered sand in water set better on oil, which otherwise would be
        refused.”</p>
    <p>For some words, while the translation might have been quite awkward in
        the English, the use of cognates allowed us to translate the different
        material properties and connotations that were expressed in the French.
        For example, an English word like “appropriate,” often used because of
        its adaptability, actually turned out to be quite problematic, and had
        to be used sparingly. In “Turtles,” on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/144r/f/144r/tl"><u>144r</u></a>,
        the author-practitioner cautions the reader to mold “celles de bas de
        deulx ou trois ou quattre <strong>selon l’exigence</strong>.” We
        initially translated “selon l’exigence” as “according to their
        appropriateness.” However, “appropriate” and “appropriateness” were also
        being used as the cognate of <em>propre,</em> an expression that appears
        often in the text and holds a different set of meanings. Since
        <em>l’exigence</em> only appears once in the entire manuscript, on fol.
        <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/144r/f/144r/tl"><u>144r</u></a>,
        we decided to retain the word “appropriate” only for the translation for
        the more common <em>propre</em>, and to translate <em>l’exigence</em> as
        “according to the need.” Contrarily, there were some cases where the
        cognates failed to express the full meaning of a word. For example
        <em>malaisé,</em> in “Molding turtles,” on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/147r/f/147r/tl"><u>147r</u></a>,
        was initially translated as “difficult,” but was later changed to
        “awkward.” Similarly <em>fantasque</em>, found in “Molding hollow” on
        fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/151r/f/151r/tl"><u>151r</u></a>,
        was not translated as “fantastical” but rather as “fanciful.”&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The attention to linguistic agency ran parallel to a new markup policy
        that sought to emphasize key elements in the manuscript and needed to
        remain consistent across all versions of the transcription and
        translation (<i><u>Fig. 25</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 26</u></i>). The renewed
        conceptual work occurring on the markup protocol at the same time as the
        re-translation of the manuscript implied a certain amount of crossover
        between the two types of working groups, most notably when body parts,
        for example, were being mentioned in French. In “Turtles,” on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/144r/f/144r/tl"><u>144r</u></a>,
        the French reads: “Doncques pour mectre la <strong>main</strong> à
        l’oeuvre<em>...</em>.” Here the mention of the hand is of extreme
        relevance to both the concept of embodied artisanal practice and in
        regard to the markup. The body part, the hand, had to be kept in the
        translation in order to keep the markup consistent between the different
        language versions of Ms. Fr. 640. In 2015, we translated it as: “So to
        get started...,” but changed it to: “Therefore, to put your hand to the
        work...”&nbsp;in 2019.</p>

    <p>In the first three workshops, we were often overinterpreting the text for
        the sake of clarity and fluency, but with the second translation, we
        made efforts to avoid superfluous information. For example, we
        endeavored to keep verb tense and passive/active voices the same in
        English as in French; pronouns that may have been added in the first
        translation were removed, even if it meant retaining in English a
        certain lack of specificity present in the French text. These
        translation protocols—keeping the syntax, grammar, and structure of the
        French, and refusing to add additional information—resulted in what may
        appear as an awkward English translation. We translated sentences such
        as “Aultant en peulx tu faire à tous aultres animalets avecq de <strong>
            la graine de grand passevelours,</strong>
        <strong>du petit</strong>, et la graine de chou navette...” (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/144r/f/144r/tl"><u>144r</u></a>),
        where it is unclear whether the author-practitioner was referring to
        both big and small amaranth or if he simply forgot to write the name of
        a plant after <em>petit</em>, as: “You can do this as well with all
        other small animals, with some grain of large amaranth, some of small,
        and grain of rapeseed ....” The uncertainty present in the French
        remains in the English. In some rare cases, staying close to the French
        syntax actually helped with comprehension in English, illustrating the
        perils of overinterpretation or of over-translation. For example, in
        “Molding turtles,” on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/146v/f/146v/tl"><u>146v</u></a>,
        we have “Comme tu as bien <strong>descouvert la partie du ventre de la
            tortue, les dessoubs de la gorge &amp; des pattes</strong>, &amp;
        bien nettoyé le tout....” This was initially translated as: “Since you
        have cleanly uncovered the part of the belly of the turtle, its
        underparts, its throat, and its legs, and having cleaned it well...,”
        implying that both the underpart of the turtle, as well as its whole
        legs and throat, were to be uncovered. The author-practitioner, however,
        is talking about cleaning the underpart of the legs and the throat, and
        not the entire turtle, hence the second translation: “When you have well
        uncovered the part of the belly of the turtle, the underneath of the
        throat &amp; of the legs, &amp; having cleaned it all well….” We took
        similar care in respecting the original French punctuation, with the
        result that while the first set of translations favored shorter
        sentences, the final version mirrored the manuscript’s longer
        sentences.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>The overarching consequence of using these translation protocols meant
        that previous traces of individual translators’ writing styles were
        erased. As a group of academics, our personal translation styles were as
        much a matter of taste as of training: they varied widely and wildly,
        and came across even when translating a single manuscript written by a
        single author-practitioner. All the guidelines discussed above helped to
        excise personal style in favor of a more unified and “guided”
        translation. A final example that sums up the shift in thinking is the
        relatively straightforward sentence: “Maistre Alexandre dict <strong>ne
            s’estre jamays trompé</strong> …” (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/151r/f/151r/tl"><u>151r</u></a>),
        which we initially translated as: “Mr. Alexander says he has never gone
        astray with ….”. The “has never gone astray” was too embellished for the
        new translation protocols, and we amended the sentence to the perhaps
        dryer, but more faithful: “Master Alexandre says that he has never gone
        wrong with …” in 2018.</p>
    <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>In September 2018, we were invited to participate in a final week-long
        workshop in which the Making and Knowing team completed the full
        translation of Ms. Fr. 640. There, we were asked to write an essay about
        the translation process since we had attended all of the workshops and
        had translated all the casting entries, which figure as over a third of
        the manuscript. A year later in September 2019, the final working group
        meeting took place at Columbia University and all scholars writing
        essays for the digital edition gathered to read and provide feedback on
        each other’s work. In between the two meetings of 2018 and 2019, the
        Making and Knowing Team completed a full readthrough and revision of the
        English text, “consistifying” translations of all entries. Even at what
        some might consider this late date, some translations were amended. What
        emerged at the working group meeting was that translating Ms. Fr. 640
        has been and continues to be an iterative process, open to
        interpretation and to the layers of meaning that can be uncovered in its
        words. Even after the digital edition had “officially” been completed,
        certain translations were still being revised and reworked due to new
        inputs from the working group scholars’ comments and discoveries. And,
        as the Making and Knowing Team re-edited student research essays to
        correct versions of the translation used in past lab seminars,
        translations were often revisited and amended again. In this process, it
        became clear that the digital nature of the Edition makes possible a new
        level of consistency: text editing software allows a search for all
        occurrences and conjugations of any given word and a comparison of the
        various translations. This capacity gave new insights into the meaning
        of obscure terms, but it also posed new and thorny questions about
        consistency of meaning, language variability, and principles of
        translation and interpretation, only made more complex by the compiled
        nature of a text such as Ms. Fr. 640. Like much of the process described
        in this essay, such questions would probably never have been raised by a
        translation that was undertaken in a non-collaborative and non-digital
        environment. The translation presented in the digital edition is thus
        one of the many translations that could be offered up to the public, and
        in this essay we have sought to explain and articulate why this
        translation and not another. In line with the Making and Knowing ethos,
        the translation is not meant to be authoritative but, rather, a truly
        working document that will have lives after this one.</p>
    <p>In their translation of the <em>Lives</em> of Vasari, art historian André
        Chastel and his team note:&nbsp;</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>The version we are presenting is one we want to be readable by
            all.... We struggled against the wearing repetition of monotonous
            terms, resigning ourselves to using a variety of
            substitutions;&nbsp;we always chose the most concrete and colorful
            word to render uneasy expressions, for it seemed to us unfaithful to
            the spirit of Italian literature that lifeless words should be used
            to translate a formulaic expression.... We put all our efforts into
            producing an expressive fit, rather than a translation molded on the
            text, the essential thing being in our opinion to reproduce the
            rhythm, movement, the remarkable strength of style ….&nbsp;<a

               role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a>&nbsp;</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>This statement—that the “expressive fit”
        should be privileged over a “molded translation,” i.e., a more literal
        translation of the text—resonates with historian Peter Burke’s view of
        the dilemma faced by all historians in their translation of past into
        present:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>If the past is far-away distant country, it goes without saying that
            that even the most unilingual of historians is a translator. The
            latter figures as a bridge between the past and the present and
            should confront the same dilemmas as other translators, each serving
            two masters, and each seeking to remain faithful to the original,
            keeping in mind the reader.<a href="#fn21"
               class="footnote-ref"
               id="fnref21"
               role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>The Making and Knowing project, in
        contrast to Chastel’s solution, made the intentional decision to impose
        literal fidelity to the original on its translation, but that decision
        was made by taking into account the nature of the historical text being
        translated: a manuscript that expresses the trials and experiences of

        Yes, the translation demands a lot of its readers; but, in this choice
        our translation is aligned with the position taken by Lara
        Broecke:&nbsp;</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>It pained me to remove from my first translation some of the happier
            solutions I had found for Cennini’s verbal muddles, and it bothers
            me to picture the reader stumbling over every sentence and wishing
            that the text were a little easier to follow. However, it pains me
            more to think of the earnest, humble, affectionate, humorous Cennino
            whom I have come to know in the course of making this translation
            being erased from his own treatise, to be replaced by a
            smooth-tongued imposter.<a href="#fn22"
