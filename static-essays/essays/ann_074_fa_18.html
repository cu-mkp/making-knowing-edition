        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <div>
            <p>This essay reconstructs two recipes concerning the treatment of
                precious stones. The first, “For Diamond Points for Engraving”
                (fol. <a
                   href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/11v/f/11v/tl"><u>11v</u></a>),
                offers instructions to trace a design onto a stone in
                preparation for engraving. The second, “Polishing of Stones”
                (fol. <a
                   href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/13r/f/13r/tl"><u>13r</u></a>),
                concerns the polishing of already engraved or faceted stones. By
                reconstructing two processes practiced by goldsmiths, this essay
                aims to clarify the extent of the author-practitioner's
                knowledge of a specialized craft.</p>

    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
    <p>BnF Ms. Fr. 640 contains thirty-two entries on the treatment of stones
        and gemstones (see Appendix at the end of this essay). They range in
        tone and purpose, from brief statements that identify appropriate
        polishing grits to detailed instructions for the creation of
        “counterfeit” gemstones.<a href="#fn1"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref1"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> Of those thirty-two, twenty-three
        involve gemstones (<em>pierreries</em>) and amount to an informal
        collection of entries on gems and their treatments. Engraved gems have
        been worn and collected as objects invested with personal attachment and
        mystical properties since antiquity.<a href="#fn2"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref2"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> Although discussion of gems
        persisted through the early modern period in popular texts on healing
        and alchemy, and were in some cases accepted as useful in medical
        practice, the author-practitioner does not mention these uses.<a
           href="#fn3"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref3"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> Instead, a loose cluster of
        entries (fols. <a

        details the working of gems and metals for decorative purposes; this
        essay focuses on two of those entries, “For Diamond Points for
        Engraving” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/11v/f/11v/tl"><u>11v</u></a>)
        and “Polishing of Stones” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/13r/f/13r/tl"><u>13r</u></a>).
        The former appears on a folio with three other short recipes, two of
        which concern the decoration of steel and gold, and the latter shares
        its page with instructions on pewtering tin and calcining gold. These
        two entries help locate the manuscript’s entries on gemstones within the
        art of the goldsmith, whose expertise encompassed precious stones and
        metals.<a href="#fn4"

           role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
    <p>The author-practitioner’s interest in the lapidary arts should first be
        contextualized within the expansion of the trade. In the first place, a
        rise in the collecting of precious stones was tied to global trade,
        since the introduction of emeralds, rubies, and diamonds into European
        markets increased the number and quality of stones available.<a
           href="#fn5"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref5"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> In Venice, availability coupled
        with increasing interest in natural history cultivated fascination with
        gems both as <em>objets d’art</em> and natural materials.<a href="#fn6"

    <p>Texts describing new tools and techniques accompanied collectors’ growing
        interest in gems. A key example is the <em>Konst grafwa stena</em>
        (<em>The Art of Engraving Stones</em>), a text Marjolijn Bol considers
        emblematic of the state of the art of the lapidary in the early
        sixteenth century.<a href="#fn10"

    <p>Tools, access to stones, and practical knowledge framed a goldsmith’s
        practices. Consideration of the tools, machines, grits, and precious
        stones that appear in Ms. Fr. 640 therefore helps clarify the extent of
        the author-practitioner’s knowledge and practice of the lapidary arts.
        “For Diamond Points for Engraving” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/11v/f/11v/tl"><u>11v</u></a>)
        and “Polishing and Engraving Stones” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/13r/f/13r/tl"><u>13r</u></a>)
        concern the preparation and polishing of engraved stones specifically,
        or stones bearing designs carved in relief. In “For Diamond Points for
        Engraving” (fol. 11v) the author-practitioner mentions two tools
        commonly used to engrave and polish stones: diamond points and a wheel.
    </p>
    <p>The first, diamond points, are used to “trace” (<em>trasser</em>) what
        one wants to “draw” (<em>desseigner</em>) on a stone. Diamond is the
        hardest stone; as such, it can cut easily any other stone but can be cut
        only by another diamond.<a href="#fn15"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref15"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> Diamond-tipped scribers or
        styluses have been the tools of choice for incising designs on stones
        since antiquity. According to Pliny, engravers sought out shards of
        diamonds broken “into splinters” because they could be inserted into
        iron tools and used to cut the hardest of materials with little
        effort.<a href="#fn16"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref16"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> Medieval and early modern
        artisans continued to use diamond points for this same purpose. The
        fourteenth-century <em>Doctrina Poliendi pretiosos lapides</em>, for
        example, includes an entry “for engraving stones” (<em>pour graver les
            pierres</em>) that entails the use of a stylus with a diamond
        point.<a href="#fn17"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref17"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
    <p>While the basic principle of abrading a stone with harder grits persisted
        from antiquity to the early modern period, in the sixteenth century the
        use of rotary machines expedited processes of polishing, shaping, and
        engraving. By the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, rotary technologies
        were used for all lapidary techniques (<i><u>Fig. 1</u></i>).<a
           href="#fn18"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref18"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> The author-practitioner does
        mention a wheel in “For Diamond Points for Engraving,” but not for the
        purpose of tracing or engraving. He instead counsels to “unpolish”
        (<em>despolir</em>) stones on a lead wheel. His instruction to “unpolish
        on a lead wheel” wheel contains two significant word choices—one relates
        to technique and tool, the other to material and texture.</p>

    <p>First, the author-practitioner organizes his process within the paradigm
        of fat and lean.<a href="#fn19"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref19"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a> Diamond points must be rubbed
        against each other if they are “fatty” (<em>grasses</em>) and “cannot
        bite” (<em>ne peuvent mordre</em>); stones similarly have their “fatty”
        quality diminished before being incised. “Fatty,” a term used by
        sixteenth-century artisans, miners, and scholars, describes earth and
        stone by analogy to the richness of agricultural land, or the properties
        of clay.<a href="#fn20"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref20"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> Biringuccio, for example, writes
        that the use of lean clay in a crucible made it more resistant to fire;
        lean metal for casting in bronze was more brittle but resistant to fire,
        while fattiness gave metal more malleability.<a href="#fn21"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref21"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a> In “Diamond points for
        engraving,” the term “fatty” can be seen to refer to the texture of a
        polished stone. Polishing entails the gradual removal of the stone’s
        surface in a progression from coarse to fine scratches until they are
        imperceptible to the human eye and hand. At that point, the eye
        perceives a gloss and the stone feels slick to the touch.<a href="#fn22"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref22"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a> The same “fatty” quality of a
        polished stone, however, prevents diamond points from “biting” on its
        surface. The author-practitioner therefore recommends that one decrease
        the fattiness of the stone to help the diamond point grab onto its
        surface. In his instruction to “unpolish” (<em>despolir</em>) the stone,
        he refers to the removal of a gloss achieved by polishing, which is
        perceived as fatty.<a href="#fn23"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref23"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a> The author-practitioner’s final
        remark on the “fatty” quality of a fingernail alludes to an artisan’s
        use of his body as a tool of quality control: because artisans commonly
        tested the sharpness of their tools against their fingernails, the
        author-practitioner references this practice to explain and justify why
        both tool and stone should not be “fatty.”<a href="#fn24"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref24"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a> This remark, which can be
        understood within a broad artisanal epistemology rather than one
        specific to goldsmiths, communicates the desired texture of a stone for
        tracing.</p>
    <p>Second, the author-practitioner describes the use of diamond points set
        in an iron stylus, and not a rotary drill or lathe, for “tracing” a
        desired design on a stone. Though the author-practitioner’s ambiguous
        description does not exclude the use of a rotary machine for tracing,
        the “diamond points” in this entry more likely to refer to a scriber.
        The use of diamond points to “trace” rather than “engrave” supports this
        hypothesis.<a href="#fn25"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref25"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a> Tracing (<em>trasser</em>) on
        stone with a scriber and engraving (<em>graver</em>) with a lathe
        signify distinct techniques and produce entirely different results. In
        the manuscript “trace” is used to refer to transferring images (fol.
        42v, 46v, 39v) or going over lines (102v, 163r, 37v, 152v). “Tracing”
        does not necessarily imply a discernible removal of matter from the
        stone’s surface as “engraving” does.</p>
    <p>For my reconstruction of “For diamond points for engraving,” I used a
        diamond-tipped scriber to trace a design onto a polished amethyst (<i><u>Fig. 2</u></i>). I selected a translucent amethyst with one flat
        side to eliminate the necessity of shaping a workable side, since this
        would have required the use of a lapidary wheel (<i><u>Fig. 3</u></i>).
        Without a wheel, I also could not “unpolish” the stone as the
        author-practitioner suggests. Though I did not remove the stone of its
        polish by roughening its surface, the diamond-tipped scriber still
        scratched the surface of the amethyst easily, yielding a faint but
        legible design after several “tracings” (<i><u>Fig. 4</u></i>). Since
        the diamond points bit well on a polished stone, the instruction to
        “unpolish” or “roughen” a stone in order to facilitate tracing remains
        ambiguous. The distinction between “trace” and “engrave,” on the other
        hand, was clear and appropriate for this entry: tracing a design with a
        diamond-tipped scribe resulted in a removal of material from the stone’s
        surface visible to the eye but imperceptible to the touch as relief (<i><u>Fig. 5</u></i>).<a href="#fn26"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref26"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a> According to the entry, this
        traced stone would have been ready for the implied step of engraving.

    <p>Although the title and the implied preparatory step prior to tracing
        suggest this entry is about engraving stones, engraving techniques and
        instruments are conspicuously absent. “Engrave” (<em>graver</em>) is
        used in Ms. Fr. 640 across media, namely to work wood, iron, stone,
        copper, and glass, and it refers most certainly in this entry to the
        engraving of gemstones. However, the author-practitioner never mentions
        “engraved gemstones” as a category of object, or the use of a lathe, the
        tool most commonly used to engrave gemstones.<a href="#fn27"

        supplies instructions for the polishing of an engraved stone. As
        mentioned, the key intermediate step between these two—the engraving of
        the stone—is absent. I chose to engrave a stone in this reconstruction
        for several reasons. Polishing a freshly engraved stone might help
        clarify whether or not the “Polishing Engraved Stones” entry was
        intended for a newly engraved stone, presumably executed by the
        author-practitioner himself, or an already-engraved stone acquired by
        the author-practitioner.</p>
    <p>As described in <em>De natura fossilium</em> of 1546 by Georgius Agricola
        (1494–1555), gem engravers used rotary tools consisting of a diamond-tip
        set in an iron stylus placed in a shaft. A heavy cord is wrapped around
        this shaft and attached to a wheel. The engraver turns the wheel with
        the right hand and, while rotating the shaft, holds the stone against
        this stylus with the left hand.<a href="#fn28"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref28"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a> Accordingly, it is difficult to
        follow with a lathe the design traced with a diamond point on a
        gemstone. While tracing on stone is done much like drawing, engraving
        requires one to hold the stone against a machine, moving it in slight
        motions. The author-practitioner was clearly aware of the use of lathes,
        as he refers to goldsmiths using this machine to make wooden forms for
        “grand works” in a different entry.<a href="#fn29"

        engraving in Ms. Fr. 640 suggests that the author-practitioner did not
        observe or engrave his gems, which may in fact be consistent with period
        practices. By the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, artisans began to
        specialize in either gem engraving or gem cutting; the former was
        reserved for select goldsmiths.<a href="#fn30"

    <p>For the purpose of reconstructing “Polishing Engraved Stones” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/13r/f/13r/tl"><u>13r</u></a>),
        I engraved the amethyst with diamond-tipped burrs installed in modern
        lapidary equipment (<i><u>Fig. 6</u></i>). All polishing and engraving
        requires the mixing of abrasives in water or oil, which act as a coolant
        and lubricant.<a href="#fn31"

        shallow design I traced with a diamond-point disappeared (<i><u>Fig.
                7</u></i>). Similarly, engraving with a slurry of grit and oil
        or water, as gem engravers traditionally did, would render the design
        invisible by obscuring the surface of the stone.<a href="#fn32"

        its roughness; newly engraved stones require another polish to restore
        them to a shine (<i><u>Fig. 9</u></i>). The instruction to “trace what
        you want to draw on stone” coupled with the absence of observations or
        records of the engraving process itself suggest the delegation of this
        step to a specialist.</p>

    <p>Though it is unlikely that the author-practitioner engraved precious
        stones, he was plausibly familiar with techniques of polishing and
        setting. He refers to using gemstone backings in ways that suggest their
        presence in his workshop, invoking burnishing techniques as a point of
        reference and repurposing the backings for other projects.<a
           href="#fn34"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref34"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a> There are in fact two entries in
        Ms. Fr. 640 dedicated to polishing stones. In “Polishing of Stones”
        (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/8v/f/8v/tl"><u>8v</u></a>),
        the author-practitioner refers to the use of a hierarchy of tools
        depending on the hardness of the stone. Amethyst, emerald, and “the more
        tender stones” are polished on the tin wheel, whereas diamond, ruby,
        sapphire, and oriental jacinth, all grouped together in this entry as
        stones of a similar hardness, are commonly cut or polished on the copper
        wheel. Since diamonds, sapphires, and corundum are all above 9 on the
        Mohs scale and are at least 400 times harder than amethyst, which is a 7
        on the Mohs scale, amethyst is indeed a “tender stone” by comparison;
        the author-practitioner’s suggestions are consistent with period and
        modern knowledge of the relative hardness of these stones.<a
           href="#fn35"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref35"

           id="fnref36"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
    <p>The use of tin, lead, or copper wheels, however, is irrelevant to the
        hardness of the stone. Abrasives determine the lapidary’s ability to
        polish hard stones rather than the metal of the wheels such abrasives
        are applied to. In the case of “tender stones,” emery or diamond should
        still be used.<a href="#fn37"

        lead, tin, and copper wheels and the lack of specificity about a
        polishing grit raises an inconsistency between Ms. Fr. 640 and
        contemporaneous lapidary texts. This reflects either a lack of knowledge
        on the author-practitioner’s part, or simply that he did not feel it
        necessary to record. There are reasons to see the latter possibility as
        likely.</p>
    <p>Other entries on gemstones and metalwork support the hypothesis that the
        author-practitioner possessed the knowledge of the appropriate grit. The
        author-practitioner observed gem cutting and shaping, as suggested by
        his entry “Sapphire” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/38r/f/38r/tl"><u>38r</u></a>),
        in which he describes stonecutters counterfeiting sapphires with antique
        glass. In order to do so, “they choose beautiful blue” and “cut it in
        squares with emery.”<a href="#fn39"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref39"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>39</sup></a> The use of “they” and his
        further details of their cutting “in bevel” and subsequent polishing
        suggest that the author-practitioner was aware of the grit needed to cut
        antique glass, let alone harder stones.</p>
    <p>The author-practitioner details the need for a specific grit in his
        second entry on polishing. “Polishing Engraved Stones” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/13r/f/13r/tl"><u>13r</u></a>)
        refers to a point in an engraved stone’s lifecycle after its cutting,
        shaping, and polishing. “Flat” and “faceted” stones are polished on a
        copper wheel, with no mention of an accompanying grit. Engraved stones,
        on the other hand, should be polished not on the copper wheel, but with
        “brushes and tripoli.” Tripoli is a common material in Ms. Fr. 640 and
        in early modern lapidary workshops. Agricola describes the use of
        tripoli as the first abrasive agent used to polish a gem: it is an earth
        “sprinkled on a lead wheel which is rotated with the right hand while
        the gem is held firmly against it with the left.”<a href="#fn40"

           id="fnref40"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>40</sup></a> Unlike Agricola, the
        author-practitioner makes no mention of a device such as a wooden

    <p>The tripoli and brushes accomplished nothing perceptible to either touch
        or sight, even at 20x magnification (<i><u>Fig. 10</u></i>). The
        scratches on the stone’s relief appear consistent both before and after
        polishing. Polishing by hand is a laborious and time-intensive process,
        and I polished for only an hour. It is unsurprising, then, that the
        results were imperceptible. Based on consultation with an expert
        jeweler, however, polishing with tripoli as a grit charged on a
        wheel—let alone manually with brushes—is unlikely to make any difference
        on a newly engraved stone.<a href="#fn42"

    <p>The use of tripoli and brushes, which were both readily available in the
        workshop and used at the time, may have been sufficient to polish
        engraved stones to <em>higher</em> shine, rather than polish a
        particularly rough, newly-engraved surface to a base level of shine.
        Tripoli’s lack of effect on the amethyst may illuminate more precisely
        the state of the stone referenced in this entry. Brushes and tripoli
        were likely not intended to be used on a stone engraved personally by
        the author-practitioner. Instead, they may indicate the
        author-practitioner’s recording of received knowledge about polishing
        techniques or possession of an already engraved cameo or intaglio, the
        polish of which he desired to further refine.</p>
    <p>Though the author-practitioner mentions the need for tripoli and brushes,
        Mansson notes that the brushes are to be set in a lathe—a tool the
        author-practitioner does not mention. The author-practitioner’s “brushes
        and tripoli” might imply the use of a lathe, but this would amount to
        another instance in which knowledge is assumed. His instruction to use
        “brushes and tripoli” instead of the “said wheel” of copper in this
        entry indicates his understanding of the logic behind each of their
        uses: flat and faceted stones can be polished on a wheel because their
        surfaces meet the plane of the wheel, whereas engraved stones require
        brushes to reach grooves carved in relief. The author-practitioner was
        likely familiar with techniques specific to the latter, but not
        personally equipped to execute these tasks.</p>
    <p>The author-practitioner’s level of expertise as knowledgeable about but
        not himself practicing gem engraving opens up other possibilities as to
        the role of gemstones in his workshop. Artists were known to have
        sourced precious gems for their patrons, in which case a final polishing
        of tripoli would have simply finished their shine.<a href="#fn43"

                    The placing of amethyst as softer than diamonds, rubies, and
                    sapphires is consistent with Agricola’s hierarchy. “Gems are
                    also suitable for relief engraving and the finest figures
                    are carved on them. Some gems can be engraved more easily
                    than others, for example, carnelian, onyx, sardonyx,
                    amethyst, jaspis, molocites and smoky quartz. Certain others
                    stubbornly resist efforts to engrave them, for example,
                    Indian diamond, Scythian and Egyptian smaragdus, sapphirus,
                    sapphire and the carbunculus which holds part of the wax in
                    the signet.” Agricola, <em>De natura fossilium</em>, Book VI
