        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <div>
            <p>The term <em>or mat</em> occurs several times in Ms. Fr. 640,
                often alongside mentions of gold, gilding, and gold color. This
                essay reconstructs a recipe on fol. <a

                “Gilding molding for panels with <em>or mat</em>,” to flesh out
                the semantic richness of <em>or mat</em> in relation to the
                manuscript, contemporary artisanal and archival sources, modern
                conservation literature, museum objects, and the strange
                etymological development of the term. Ultimately, this essay
                argues that <em>or mat</em> should be considered neither as a
                material nor as a technique exclusively. Rather, early modern
                conceptual understandings of the term seem to point to the
                inextricability of the optical effects of the material from the
                processes of its making.</p>

    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
    <p>Describing practice was likely a difficult task for any early modern
        artisan. It entailed the simplification of a complex process, one that
        might involve minute adjustments, numerous trials, and unstable
        variables into a single linear narrative. Practitioners who took to
        writing were acutely aware of the ambiguity that any translation from
        the realm of practice to that of written words engendered. Taking into
        account the variability of techniques among artisans, the distortion
        inherent in the translation of practice into written text becomes even
        more pronounced.</p>
    <p>While the meaning of certain terms can evolve alongside the processes
        they describe, others can develop quite independent lives from their
        original meanings. This appears to be the case with <em>or mat</em>, a
        concept we encounter in early modern gold and gilding recipes as well as
        in a particularly detailed entry on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/66r/f/66r/tl"><u>66r</u></a>
        of BnF Ms. Fr 640.<a href="#fn1"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref1"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> The term <em>or mat</em> appears
        simultaneously to denote “matte gold,” the optical effect caused by an
        unburnished gilded surface, and the process of “mordant gilding,” a
        technique that uses an oil-based, often golden colored mordant<a
           href="#fn2"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref2"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> upon which gold leaf is applied,
        followed by a layer of varnish. Due to this ambiguity, it is often
        unclear whether the term refers to a <em>process</em> (gold leaf
        application onto a still wet or tacky mordant) or to gold metal’s
        <em>éclat</em>—its highly valued lustrous effect, which can be enhanced
        with burnishing but, in the case of <em>or mat</em>, is an unburnished
        finish created on the gold surface of mordant gilded substrates. This
        ambiguity exemplifies not only the difficult translation of process into
        words but also the disparate definitions and connotations that a single
        concept can acquire over time.</p>
    <p>Scholars and conservators seem divided on how to define <em>or mat</em>,
        but all agree that it involves gilding. In the early modern period,
        there were four primary techniques used for gilding: burnished leaf (or
        water gilding), flat unburnished leaf (or mordant gilding), gilded
        applied relief (or mordant gilding on a raised or molded surface), and
        shell gold<a href="#fn3"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref3"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> (which used ground gold leaf
        suspended in a medium and applied as paint).<a href="#fn4"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref4"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> Doris Oltrogge, conservator at
        the Cologne Institute of Conservation Sciences, suggests that <em>or
            mat</em> refers to the process known as mordant gilding and that the
        translation into “matte gold,” suggesting a matte or dull finish, is a
        misattribution or incorrect translation.<a href="#fn5"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref5"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> Jill Dunkerton, paintings
        conservator at the National Gallery in London, agrees that <em>or
            mat</em> refers to a gilding technique, but she suggests that a
        matte or dull finish is indeed produced with mordant gilding, since the
        gold leaf laid on the oil mordant cannot be burnished (i.e., polished to
        produce a shine) without damaging the metal’s surface.<a href="#fn6"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref6"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> Dunkerton also states that
        mordant gilding generally involves the use of yellow ocher, red lead,
        linseed oil, and sometimes varnish.<a href="#fn7"

    <p>The <em>or mat</em> recipe on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/66r/f/66r/tl"><u>66r</u></a>
        of Ms. Fr. 640 exemplifies a conspicuously ambiguous use of <em>or
            mat.</em> This is already apparent in its title, “Gilding molding
        for panels with <em>or mat</em>” (<em>Dorer mouleure de tableaulx dor
            mat</em>)<em>,</em> implying at first sight that <em>or mat</em>
        refers to some substance or material, probably a thin gold metal leaf,
        or perhaps indicating the use of an <em>or mat</em> technique or process
        to gild a molded painting frame. To complicate matters even further, the
        bizarre etymologies that emerge from research into <em>or mat</em>
        recipes suggest that this concept also gained a range of connotations
        that seem at first to be only remotely related to materials or
        processes.</p>
    <p>This essay attempts to illuminate the meaning(s) of <em>or mat</em> in
        Ms. Fr. 640 with close reading, and practice- and object-based research.
        It explores two primary questions: what is <em>or mat,</em> in terms of
        materials and techniques, and what was it used for? To begin, I first
        show what the term <em>or mat</em> meant in the context of Ms. Fr. 640
        and to its author-practitioner, first through an in-depth analysis of
        the folio with the recipe for <em>or mat</em> and its extensive marginal
        annotations, and then by contextualizing the term in the manuscript as a
        whole. Next, through a recipe genealogy, I compare the recipe on fol.
        66r to contemporary and earlier sources, and I explore the meaning of
        <em>or mat</em> in dictionaries, encyclopedias, and early modern
        documents, tracing the etymology of the term. Finally, I examine the use
        and optical effect of <em>or mat</em> by comparing objects with mordant
        gilding in museum collections. This investigation of the intriguing
        concept of <em>or mat</em> also touches on the broader question of the
        apparent inextricability of histories of materials and their properties
        from histories of techniques. I ultimately argue that <em>or mat</em>
        was understood within an early modern conceptual system that entwined
        material and process, and it is unproductive and historically fraught
        for us to consider one apart from the other.</p>

    <h3 id="reading-and-reconstructing-fol.-66r">Reading and Reconstructing Fol.
        66r </h3>
    <p>The difficulty of writing down an artisanal process is illustrated on
        fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/66r/f/66r/tl"><u>66r</u></a>
        (<i><u>Fig. 1</u></i>). The density of the text in the margins
        demonstrates the need to explain, rephrase, and revise the linear
        narrative provided under the heading “Gilding molding for panels with
        <em>or mat.</em>” The recipe begins near the bottom of the page and
        terminates in an asterisk, and it continues with the uppermost marginal
        note in the left margin, which begins with a matching asterisk. The
        recipe continues down the margin, skipping over a marginal note that
        belongs to the entry “Colors in oil that are imbibed” (i.e., “On canvas
        &amp; in distemper, one gilds with bole &amp; honey &amp; a little
        garlic juice”), and when there is no more room in the left margin of
        fol. 66r, it picks up again in the upper left margin of fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/66v/f/66v/tl"><u>66v</u></a>,
        where it finally ends with a horizontal line to underscore its bounds.
        Yet there is more. An interlinear note positioned between the heading
        and the body text on fol. 66r, and which ends in another asterisk,
        directs the reader to the following page (fol. 66v), where, below the
        horizontal line in the left margin, the discussion picks up again at a
        note that begins with a corresponding asterisk. It seems likely, in
        fact, that this latter set of additions may have been composed before
        the former.</p>

    <p>The central text of the recipe is written in a small, cramped script,
        which suggests that it was added to the page after it had already been
        completed.<a href="#fn8"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref8"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> That said, despite its status as
        a later addition, the author-practitioner’s treatment of the <em>or
            mat</em> recipe is anything but minor. The main text of the recipe,
        in line with the other four recipes on the page, describes the gilding
        method used by <em>les flaments</em>. Rather than instructing the
        reader, it describes in the third person how “the Flemish” apply a layer
        of distempered glue and lamp black on “the molding.” The recipe does not
        specify what sort of molding this is, but it seems to refer to the
        moldings of the wooden frame of a painting.<a href="#fn9"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref9"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> The recipe continues with the
        observation that, after the lamp black layer has dried, the
        <em>moresque</em> ornamentations are polished and then painted by the
        Flemish artisans with a mixture of pigments bound together in <em>huile
            gras</em> (“fatty oil”), which, the author-practitioner notes, is
        the thickened oil that the Flemish used to clean paint brushes.<a
           href="#fn10"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref10"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> They then apply gold leaf on top
        of these painted ornamentations and varnish the entire surface, gold
        leaf and lamp black together, making it appear that “all this black is
        painted in oil.” At the bottom of the recipe text, however, the
        author-practitioner cautions against the direct application of the gold
        onto the freshly painted moldings, since the process is imperfect and
        the gold leaf can attach to surfaces other than the moresque
        ornamentations, a problem that can be solved by allowing more time to
        dry, as he notes in the margin.</p>
    <p>The author-practitioner calls for painting the moresques “with minium,
        massicot [<em>avecq du minium du massicot</em>], &amp; <em>ocre de
            ru</em> [...] because the three aforesaid colors are gripping &amp;
        dry immediately.” He later squeezed the words “and a little yellow
        ocher” between the recipe’s lines, above the list of pigments. The
        French phrasing <em>avecq du minium du massicot</em> is ambiguous.
        First, it could indicate that the Flemish use both minium <em>and</em>
        massicot to create a gold color, as reflected in the Making and Knowing
        Project’s translation. Alternatively, since minium (more commonly known
        as red lead) is produced through the heating of massicot (yellow lead),
        “<em>avecq du minium du massicot</em>” could mean to use red minium
        derived from bright yellow massicot, rather than using both color
        pigments, minium and massicot, and thus excluding massicot completely
        from the gold color recipe.<a href="#fn11"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref11"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> Another ambiguity is the meaning
        of <em>ocre de ru</em>. Recent scholarship sheds light on this point. Jo
        Kirby suggests that “oker de rowse” or “de rux” might have been a
        brownish-yellow color.<a href="#fn12"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref12"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> R. D. Harley agrees, writing
        that it was used as a hair color in painting and cites Hilliard as
        saying that it was used for yellow shading, which suggests that it was a
        darker yellow, perhaps a brown shade.<a href="#fn13"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref13"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
    <p>At the end of the main text of the recipe is a note, “Go back to the top
        to *” (<em>Retourne hault a ce *</em>), that directs the reader to the
        margin at the top of fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/66r/f/66r/tl"><u>66r</u></a>.
        Interestingly, this long note, consisting of seven dense paragraphs
        running parallel to the recipes from top to bottom and even continuing
        onto the verso of the folio (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/66v/f/66v/tl"><u>66v</u></a>),
        presents a marked change from a descriptive to an instructional voice,
        perhaps indicating that the author-practitioner had since performed the
        experiment.<a href="#fn14"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref14"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> In this marginal note, the
        author-practitioner again lists the ingredients for the colored
        underlayer, here including yellow ocher along with the other three
        pigments, and without specifying any amounts. Having removed the
        qualifier “un peu” in this second iteration of the recipe, we may ask
        whether he now recommends using more yellow ocher than the Flemish do,
        or an amount more comparable to that of the other three pigments.</p>
    <p>In the marginal note, the author practitioner also specifies that the
        gold leaf is not applied immediately after the underlayer has been
        painted; rather, one should wait one day before gilding.<a href="#fn15"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref15"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> The gilding should then be
        allowed to set for another day, at which point “Flanders varnish” mixed
        with spirits should be applied to the entire frame, enhancing the gold
        color and changing the optical effect of the glue-based black paint to
        make it look like oil paint. Below this, the author-practitioner
        continues with another short note about varnish. He observes that the
        varnish will increase (<em>augmentera</em>) the color of the gold and
        notes the length of time required for the varnish layer to dry: one
        hour. He then observes that the varnish makes the <em>or mat</em>
        water-resistant, provided one rubs the surface after waiting eight or
        ten days for the varnish to dry. The author-practitioner specifies using
        Flanders varnish that is mixed with spirits to make it more
        dessicative.<a href="#fn16"

           id="fnref16"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
    <p>Just below the note on varnish, the author-practitioner clarifies the
        type of “fatty” or “thickened” oil (<em>huile gras</em>) to be used for
        “gold color” (<em>or couleur</em>).<a href="#fn17"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref17"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> While in the main text, the
        author-practitioner had noted that the Flemish use the thickened oil in
        which they clean their oil brushes, here he recommends using oil that
        has been thickened in the sun (i.e., stand oil) instead. He writes that
        this stand oil will not tarnish the final gold leaf layer whereas the
        oil made from cleaning brushes will, due to the presence of verdigris in
        the mixture.<a href="#fn18"
           class="footnote-ref"

    <p>At the bottom of the marginal note on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/66r/f/66r/tl"><u>66r</u></a>
        includes a number of seemingly miscellaneous observations. These are
        squeezed into the final inches of the folio’s margin, and this limited
        space may account for the proximity of these disparate observations.
        First, the author-practitioner writes that the mordant layer should not
        be touched with one’s fingers or else the gold will not adhere to the
        surface.<a href="#fn19"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref19"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a> Presumably one would touch the
        mordant in order to determine its tackiness and ensure that it is dry
        enough to be gilded upon. In a subsequent note on fol. 66v, the
        author-practitioner specifies that the reader can determine the
        appropriate tackiness of the mordant by breathing on it. If one’s breath
        condenses on the surface of the mordant, it is ready for the gold leaf
        to be applied.<a href="#fn20"

    <p>The author-practitioner then writes two further notes that compare this
        <em>or mat</em> technique to other gilding methods. First, he compares
        the water resistance of <em>or moulu</em> to that of <em>or mat</em>.<a
           href="#fn21"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref21"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a> Then he advises that one should
        not burnish the gold that has been applied to an oil base, a rather
        common practice in gilding techniques, otherwise the gold leaf surface
        will be damaged. Next he instructs the reader to collect the <em>baves
            &amp; petites lambeaulx</em> (“protrusions &amp; small flakes”) that
        are removed by the cotton when the gold is dry. He then finishes this
        paragraph on “gold color” writing, “it is more beautiful when it is a
        little thick, but in France they beat it too delicately.” Presumably the
        first “it” refers to the visual effect of the <em>or mat</em>, and the
        second “it” refers to the gold leaf that is a little thick.<a
           href="#fn22"

    <p>The last two notes on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/66r/f/66r/tl"><u>66r</u></a>
        return to the tackiness of the mordant. In these notes, the
        author-practitioner departs from his previous advice to use the tactile
        quality of the mordant or the visible condensation of one’s breath on
        the surface to determine the appropriate time to apply the gold.
        Instead, he writes that one must not gild <em>or mat</em> directly after
        having applied the gold colored mordant; rather, one should wait one day
        or one night for the mordant to dry so that it can better grip the gold
        leaf.<a href="#fn23"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref23"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a> The recommended waiting time
        prevents the gold leaf from adhering to the black paint so that it will
        only attach itself to the now tacky mordant, since the oil-based mordant
        dries much more slowly than the glue distemper used for the black
        background. Having run out of space on fol. 66r, the author-practitioner
        continues at the top of fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/66v/f/66v/tl"><u>66v</u></a>,
        where he specifies that when the gold colored mordant begins to adhere
        (<em>gripper</em>), this is a sign that it will be ready for gilding in
        ten or twelve hours.</p>
    <p>Finally, it appears that the author-practitioner returned to the recipe a
        third time. Just beneath the heading of the <em>or mat</em> recipe on
        fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/66r/f/66r/tl"><u>66r</u></a>,
        there is a directive note: “see the other side of this folio this mark:
        *” (<em>voy de laultre part de ce foeillet ceste marque *</em>), which
        sends the reader to the margin of the folio’s verso (i.e., fol. 66v).
        The author distinguishes this new note from the long marginal note that
        had continued from fol. 66r by drawing a line above the new note marked
        with an asterisk mark. This new note on fol. 66v introduces two new
        ingredients to the <em>or mat</em> recipe, instructing that in addition
        to stand oil (which he again specifies is not the kind used to clean
        brushes), one can also use a little varnish or ceruse (lead white) for
        the mordant. For his final note, the author-practitioner compares <em>or
            mat</em> to burnished gold, saying that <em>or mat</em> can be made
        quickly and lasts longer, it is water resistant, and is scarcely less
        beautiful than burnished gold.</p>
    <h3 id="experiment">Experiment</h3>
    <p>Due to the numerous ambiguities in the <em>or mat</em> recipe, I designed
        my experiments to test a variety of variables. First, I wanted to test
        the optimal combination of the pigments listed in the recipe. Would the
        best gold color be produced using all four pigments? Which pigments
        should be used in greatest quantities, and which should be used
        sparingly? I designed three combinations for the experiment, labeled T1,
        T2, and T3, varying the proportions of the pigments in each (<i><u>Fig. 2</u></i>).<a href="#fn24"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref24"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a> Second, the drying time seemed
        essential to the setting process of <em>or mat</em> gilding, so I
        designed an experiment with two trials: one that allowed the mordant
        layer to dry for twenty-four hours, and another in which it dried for
        ninety-six hours.<a href="#fn25"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref25"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a> Third, I wanted to see the
        effect of the varnish not only on the gold but also on the gold color. I
        hypothesized that the gold color of the mordant layer would make flaws
        or losses to the gold leaf less apparent. I hoped to determine whether
        the varnish layer contributed to this effect.</p>

    <p>First, I experimented with various combinations of red lead (minium) and
        yellow lead (massicot) to determine the meaning of <em>avecq du minium
            du massicot</em>. It became immediately apparent that the second
        reading of the phrase, which excluded the use of yellow lead and
        specified that the red lead was derived from the yellow, was incorrect.
        The red lead was far too bright an orange without the yellow lead to
        temper it into a more subdued golden color (<i><u>Fig. 3</u></i>).
        Further, a combination with more yellow ocher (which already had a color
        quite close to the desired gold hue) and little to no yellow lead
        appeared promising on the clear, glass mixing plate; however, when
        applied to the lamp black distemper layer, the yellow ocher-based gold
        color appeared to be almost fully absorbed by the black underlayer.
        After I had established that the opaque property of yellow lead
        (massicot) was essential to achieving a gold colored mordant, I started
        to experiment with the addition of red lead. In the second and third
        combinations for the gold color, I increased the amount of yellow ocher
        to temper the bright yellow of the massicot, and included (4C) and
        excluded (4B) red lead from the mixture. While in both cases, the golden
        color improved with the addition of more yellow ocher, it was obvious
        that the red lead could not be excluded entirely, since it gave a
        necessary warmth and opacity to the golden color (<i><u>Fig. 4</u></i>).
        This is evident when comparing the appearance of a gold mordant produced
        with and without red lead (<i><u>Fig. 5</u></i>). The combinations
        without red or yellow lead were far more transparent and required
        additional coats to achieve the same amount of coverage as the mixture
        that included lead-based pigments. Thus, it became clear that the use of
        <em>both</em> red lead and yellow lead was essential for <em>or mat</em>
        gilding. Moreover, the consistency of the paint mattered as well.
        Thicker mixtures with lead-based pigments achieved much better coverage
        than thinner ones.</p>

    <p>This experimental observation directly coincides with an observation made
        by the author-practitioner on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/66r/f/66r/tl"><u>66r</u></a>.
        Just above the heading of the <em>or mat</em> recipe, at the conclusion
        of an entry entitled “Colors in oil that are imbibed,” he writes, “it is
        necessary that gold color be laid down thick, for if it were clear
        [<em>cler</em>], it would be imbibed &amp; would run.” In this note, he
        may be referring to the optical effect caused by painting a gold colored
        mordant on a lampblack surface (Fig. 4). The vibrancy of
        the color is absorbed by the dark lamp black layer. In the first trial I
        performed, only one layer of the mordant was applied. As a result the
        mordant dripped down the panel and became translucent <em>or cler.</em>
        This concluding note to the entry “Colors in oil that are imbibed” also
        gives us a clue as to why the author-practitioner included the <em>or
            mat</em> recipe on fol. 66r, squeezing it into the bottom and
        margins of the page: he seems to have seen a connection between the two
        final entries. The concluding observation to “Colors in oil” about how
        gold color is imbibed bridges from this entry to the more in-depth
        discussion of gold color in “Gilding molding for panels with <em>or
            mat</em>” below it.</p>
    <p>After twenty-four hours, I gilded the first mordant layer (<i><u>Fig. 6</u></i>). The mordant was slightly tacky to the touch, and
        moisture condensed on the surface of the mordant when I breathed on it.
        The gold leaf laid relatively flat on the surface, with a fair amount of
        crinkling. After ninety-six hours, I examined the gilding, and the
        irregular surface of the gold leaf seemed to have smoothed itself out,
        while the color had taken on a slightly orange or golden tone (<i><u>Fig. 7</u></i>). The second and third mordant layers were gilded
        after ninety-six hours, with little difference from the twenty-four-hour
        trial. In both trials the mordant was less tacky and no moisture
        collected on the surface when I breathed on it. However, the gold leaf
        still adhered to this drier mordant, though with a bit more crinkling.
        Observed twenty-four hours later, this gilding had also acquired an
        orange tone. This change in the color causes the gold leaf to tend
        towards the color of the gold mordant, perhaps contributing to the
        diminished visibility of losses in the gold leaf or flaws in its
        application.</p>

    <p>I next applied turpentine varnish, which the author-practitioner seems to

        immediate and significant effect on the appearance of the gold leaf. The
        irregularities of the unburnished gold leaf became much less pronounced
        after applying a single layer of the slightly viscous varnish, thereby
        enhancing the gold (<i><u>Fig. 8</u></i>). The gold leaf also appeared
        to take on a darker color after the varnish was applied (<i><u>Fig. 9</u></i>). This darker color seemed to bring the gold leaf
        closer to the color of the gold mordant layer. Because of this
        similarity of color, damage to the gold leaf became less apparent, a
        feature that could also be considered to “increase” the color of gold.<a

    <p>Unexpectedly, applying the varnish enabled me also to observe the
        strength of the oil mordant. The secure “grip” of the mordant became
        evident, as it stopped the gold leaf from being removed as easily as the
        gold leaf that I had applied with a water size in a problematic
        comparative trial (<i><u>Fig. 10</u></i>).<a href="#fn28"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref28"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a> This “grip” also helps to
        explain why the unburnished surface smoothed itself out over time.
        Whereas the water-based sizing allows for slight movement as the gold
        leaf smooths itself out and settles on the surface, the tacky oil
        mordant seems to prevent the gold from laying smooth on the surface when
        first applied, despite the care with which the gold leaf is laid, and it
        smoothes itself out at a much slower pace.</p>

                performed on the black distemper layer reveals the strength of
                the “grip” of the oil mordant. Whereas the fluidity of the water
                based sizing glue allows the surface of the gold leaf to even
                out over time, the adherent oil-based mordant does not allow
                this evening out to occur. The gold leaf applied to the black
                distemper square with water gilding was more damaged after the
                application of the varnish than the mordant gilding squares.
                This may be due to the inability of the water based sizing glue
                to sufficiently grip the gold leaf to the surface, particularly
                in comparison to the oil mordant. © Making and Knowing Project

    <p>Inadvertently, the phrase <em>baves &amp; petits lambeaulx</em> was also
        clarified after the application of the varnish. The excess flakes of
        gold leaf that I had not removed with the cotton became suspended in the
        varnish and speckled the lampblack panel (Fig. 9). Taking this into
        consideration, the term <em>baves</em> becomes clearer, referring to the

        distinction between the application of gold color and application of
        gold leaf, both indicated by the term <em>dorer</em>. On fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/66r/f/66r/tl"><u>66r</u></a>,
        he writes:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>One ought not to gild with <em>or mat</em> after <del>with</del>
            having gilded [<em>dorer dor mat</em> <em>apres <del>avecq</del>
                avoyr dore</em>]. But wait one day or one night, <del>But take
                heed not to</del> and when it is as if dry, it grips the gold.
            Next, one varnishes.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The author-practitioner uses the verb <em>dorer</em> in two ways in this
        sentence. First, he uses it to refer to the gold leaf of <em>or
            mat</em>, and subsequently, he uses it to refer to the gold color
        upon which the leaf is applied. This reuse of <em>dorer</em> exposes an
        ambiguity, or flexibility, in its denotation, as it refers variously to
        gilding, gold leaf, and gold color.<a href="#fn30"

        French-English dictionary provides little insight into the particular
        usage of these terms. Cotgrave defines the term <em>dorer</em> as “to
        gild, or doe over with gold;” this infinitive form of the verb seems to
        refer to the act of applying a leaf of gold, but it could also mean to
        paint over with a gold color.<a href="#fn31"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref31"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a> In addition, Cotgrave gives the
        word <em>doré</em>(<em>e</em>) three distinct definitions: “gilt over”
        is simply the adjectival form of a surface laid with gold leaf; “of
        gold” could refer either to an object made of gold metal or another
        material of gold color; and “faire, beautifull, brightly shining” lacks
        any direct relation to the metal gold.<a href="#fn32"

           role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
    <p><em>Or mat</em> appears in four different recipes in Ms. Fr. 640. First,
        the author-practitioner mentions it very briefly in his recipe “For
        laying down and seating burnished gold and giving red or green or blue”
        on folio <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/6r/f/6r/tl"><u>6r</u></a>.
        In the original French title, he forgoes the use of either term,
        <em>dorer</em> or <em>dore</em>, instead opting for the more cumbersome
        <em>Pour poser et assoir dor bruny</em>. In the first few lines of the
        text, he mentions the suitability of ceruse for <em>or mat</em> and
        introduces the adjective <em>dorees</em> (“gilded”), but he only refers
        to the application (<em>aplique</em>), not the gilding, of <em>or
            mat</em>. Throughout the rest of the recipe when referring to
        burnished gold, he alternates between the verbs <em>dorer</em> and
        <em>apliquer</em>.</p>
    <p>On fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/65r/f/65r/tl"><u>65r</u></a>,
        in the entry “Flesh color” (<em>Carnation</em>), the author-practitioner
        mentions <em>or mat</em> in a marginal note, here using the term
        <em>dorer</em> to refer to applying <em>or mat</em>. Significantly, the
        subsequent marginal note discusses the importance of “fatty colors” such
        as minium and massicot and the utility of “fatty walnut oil” for making
        “gold color” (<em>or couleur</em>). The two terms are paired again on
        fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/100r/f/100r/tl"><u>100r</u></a>,
        where <em>or mat</em> is mentioned in an entry titled “Gold color.” The
        recipe lists the ingredients for the color of the mordant layer but
        makes no explicit reference to gold leaf application.</p>
    <p>The recipe on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/99v/f/99v/tl"><u>99v</u></a>,
        “Gilding <del>your</del> moldings for panels without gold,” (“<em>Dorer
            <del>ta</del> moleures de tableaux sans or</em>”) most clearly
        displays the ambiguity of the author-practitioner’s language, using the
        word <em>dorer</em> to refer to the application of gold color without
        any gold leaf involved at all. The significance is even more pronounced
        when compared to the usage in the recipe “Color of gold without gold on
        silver” (<em>Couleur dor sans or sur largent</em>) on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/29v/f/29v/tl"><u>29v</u></a>,
        which one might think is closer to gilding in its application of a metal
        foil but here refers to gold color without gold leaf application.</p>
    <h3 id="historical-context">Historical Context</h3>
    <p>The author-practitioner’s classification of this recipe as Flemish is
        significant for our understanding of the technique. The technique was
        used not only in frame decoration but also in oil painting and fabric
        printing, with variations appearing in a number of Netherlandish and
        German sources.<a href="#fn33"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref33"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a> By the end of the fifteenth
        century, the term <em>or met</em> has become associated with this
        technique in guild statutes in the Low Countries, while <em>or de
            couleur</em> and <em>aurum madide</em> could be found in other
        contemporary sources referring to gilding on an oil mordant. Statutes
        from Antwerp’s Guild of St Luke, dated November 9, 1470, indicate that
        mordant gilding, along with many other gilding methods, was well
        established by the late fifteenth century at least.<a href="#fn34"

           id="fnref34"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a> One statute actually specifies

    <p>A late fifteenth-century German recipe refers to gilding on an oil
        mordant as <em>aurum madide</em>, which roughly translates to “wet gold”
        and alludes to the tacky or slightly wet texture of the mordant
        necessary to adhere the gold:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>For laying down wet gold: Take chalk and saffron in equal amounts,
            and take as much as these two are in weight of burnt ocher. And rub
            strongly together with beaten olive oil on a stone slab. After,
            write with this same oil, and place your gold on top.<a href="#fn37"
               class="footnote-ref"
               id="fnref37"
               role="doc-noteref"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Though it is unclear when <em>madide</em> transformed into <em>mat</em>,
        the Oxford English Dictionary traces the etymology of “mordant” in the
        English language through French (<em>mordant)</em> and Italian
        (<em>mordente</em>) to post-classical Latin (<em>mordans</em>).<a
           href="#fn38"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref38"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>38</sup></a> The Latin stem <em>mord-</em>
        means “to bite, or nip”; in this context, it likely refers to the
        substance’s ability to grip other materials. Perhaps the two root words
        became confused at some stage of development, or the biting root was
        attributed to the technique upon observation of the way the oil gold
        clings to the oil layer.</p>
    <p>In <em>Il</em> <em>libro dell’arte,</em> Cennino Cennini includes a short
        section on mordant gilding, notably followed by a small group of varnish
        recipes. The mordant, as described by Cennini, includes a heat-bodied
        oil mixed with lead white and verdigris. Among the several discrepancies
        between the recipe in Ms. Fr. 640 and Cennini’s is the latter’s use of
        very thin gold leaf for mordant gilding, whereas the author-practitioner
        recommends the use of a thicker leaf. In addition, Cennini recommends
        using one’s fingers to apply the gold leaf, while the
        author-practitioner specifically cautions against this technique lest it
        spoil the gilding. Cennini makes no indication of a gold color for this
        mordant. Rather, he describes the importance of verdigris for the drying
        time of the mordant; one imagines that this would color the mordant a
        bluish-green.<a href="#fn39"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref39"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>39</sup></a> The author-practitioner, on the
        other hand, advises against using verdigris, writing that with time it
        tarnishes the gold leaf.</p>
    <p>By the seventeenth century, even more ambiguity surrounded the mordant
        gilding technique. The recipe compilation of Swiss physician Sir
        Théodore Turquet de Mayerne includes instructions to prepare “oil for
        applying gold leaf.”<a href="#fn40"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref40"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>40</sup></a> This recipe closely resembles
        that on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/66r/f/66r/tl"><u>66r</u></a>
        of Ms. Fr. 640. Both include a heat-bodied oil, but De Mayerne specifies
        linseed oil with the addition of garlic, lead white, and an onion.
        Yellow ocher and umber are likely included to create the gold color and
        De Mayerne specifies that they be bound in the linseed oil, applied to
        the surface, and that the gold leaf be added to it when it is tacky to
        the touch. Later, in his recipe simply titled “<em>Or Couleur</em>” for
        the trim of a picture frame, De Mayerne recommends using “oily paint
        like the residues from brush cleaning” for the base coat. He continues:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Note, if you want to do your layout with a gold color on black or
            another dark paint, first the black should be mixed with glue and
            applied, and on that do your leaf work with oil. Let it dry as
            above, lay on the gold, remove the excess and finally varnish [the
            whole thing]. Then the black will look like ebony. Common varnish
            with a little spikenard oil for drying [is suitable for this].<a

    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>This description corresponds closely to
        the recipe in Ms. Fr. 640, even mentioning the black coat prepared with
        glue, with which the author-practitioner begins his recipe.</p>
    <p>The Brussels manuscript, dated 1635, mentions several recipes for mordant
        gilding (<em>or de couleur</em>).<a href="#fn42"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref42"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>42</sup></a> The first describes a process by
        which the residue from brushes is boiled and strained through a cloth to
        produce a yellow color, to which are added yellow ocher and “coarse”
        massicot and minium if the yellow color needs to be enhanced. The second
        calls for armenian bole ground with linseed or nut oil. The third
        includes yellow ocher and a little lead white, which the recipe asserts
        will make the yellow ocher “more similar to gold in color.” Much like
        the recipe on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/66r/f/66r/tl"><u>66r</u></a>,
        the Brussels manuscript recommends fatty oil (<em>huile gras</em>) to be
        used for <em>or de couleur</em> and instructs the reader to wait the
        “appropriate length of time” before applying the gold. As seen in Ms.
        Fr. 640, the Brussels manuscript advises waiting before applying varnish
        to the gold:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Note, that the or couleur must be nearly dry before the gold is laid
            on it, for otherwise the gold would become dull without any
            brilliance or splendour.<a href="#fn43"
               class="footnote-ref"
               id="fnref43"
               role="doc-noteref"><sup>43</sup></a></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The Brussels manuscript includes an intriguing definition of <em>or
            mat</em>: the term <em>mat</em> is derived from the Italian word
        meaning silly, “so that ‘<em>or mat</em>’ is <em>silly gold</em>,
        without brilliancy and splendor.”<a href="#fn44"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref44"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>44</sup></a> The manuscript also traces the
        term’s roots to the French <em>matois</em> or a “do-nothing fool,”
        presumably because the gold does not shine as it should, and also to the
        Indian or Persian term <em>Schamate</em>, meaning “the king is dead,”
        “so that ‘<em>or mat</em>’ is a dead or dull gold.”<a href="#fn45"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref45"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>45</sup></a> Cotgrave provides a similar
        definition, defining <em>mat</em> as “deaded, mated, amated, quelled,
        subdued, overcome; also as Flaccide,” with a supplementary definition of
        <em>or mat</em> as “unpolished gold.”<a href="#fn46"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref46"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>46</sup></a></p>
    <p>These rather bizarre etymological definitions betray the semantic
        ambiguity that the mordant gilding technique had acquired by the early
        seventeenth century. It is unclear to the compiler of the Brussels
        manuscript how this technique acquired the name <em>or mat</em> or how
        this name is related to <em>or de couleur</em>, and he attempts to
        reconcile this confusion by defining <em>or mat</em> as the optical
        effect that is achieved through the process called <em>or de
            couleur</em>. Judging from the Brussels manuscript and Cotrgrave’s
        attributions of <em>or mat</em>, the term could be related to the Latin
        <em>mat</em>, referring to the “unripe” quality of the gold. Base metals
        were believed to ripen into gold and, though doubtful, perhaps
        <em>mat</em> alludes to the less lustrous appearance of impure gold. The
        associations of <em>mat</em> with death could also be due to an
        incorrect association with the Latin stem <em>mort-</em> meaning “dead.”

    <p>The decoration of frames changed over time according to available

        processes involved, the text’s alignment with recipes from Flemish
        manuscripts discussed above, along with the attribution of the technique
        to the Flemish suggest that the author-practitioner may have drawn the

        the author-practitioner refers to the gold patterning in <em>or mat</em>
        as “moresque” (<em>moresque</em>). This term, in use from at least the
        fifteenth century in France, came to designate a particular kind of
        ornamental design inspired by Islamic metalwork (<i><u>Fig. 14</u></i>).<a href="#fn50"

        means confined to French decorative arts. By the mid-sixteenth century,
        they were in use across Europe, with model patterns circulating in

        sinuous, or interlaced line took on an independence from any originary
        context in Islamic art, and the author-practitioner’s familiarity with
        the term “moresque” and the patterns it came to designate need not be
        related to direct contact with Islamic arts and artisans per se.</p>

    <p>Accordingly, despite the author-practitioner’s designation of the <em>or
            mat</em> recipe as Flemish, the use of ornamental gold patterns on
        black frames is attested well outside of the Low Countries. One such
        frame, held at the Victoria and Albert Museum (<i><u>Fig. 15</u></i>),
        is believed to have been created in Venice when this style of frame was
        most in vogue (roughly 1580–1620). It is noteworthy that this vogue for
        light on dark decorative framing was also visible in contemporary
        Limoges enamels, which often display framing bands of light-colored
        grotesque ornament—an ornamental mode historically associated with
        moresques and arabesques—against dark backgrounds (<i><u>Fig. 16</u></i>).<a href="#fn51"

    <p>While ornate black frames with gold decoration seem to have been produced
        across Europe, they are often associated with the workshop of Corneille
        de Lyon (1500–1575). Also known as Corneille de La Haye, this
        Netherlandish portraitist to the European nobility received his early
        training in the Low Countries and was in Lyon by the year 1533, where he
        would establish a highly successful workshop.<a href="#fn53"

        way to account for the author-practitioner’s frequent references to the

        make any such claim.</p>
    <p>Regardless, one might imagine the author-practitioner either observing a
        Flemish painter who was decorating a frame using the <em>or mat</em>
        technique or in conversation with such an artist. The
        author-practitioner could have recorded the process in the manuscript
        and later, upon trying the technique himself, added the numerous
        marginal notes to the recipe, clarifying and refining the practice he
        had previously encountered second hand.</p>
    <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Well before the early modern period, artists, artisans, goldsmiths, and
        alchemists have all ventured, by various means, to imitate, manipulate,
        and create gold. The complex history of gold and its value inevitably
        meant that multiple terms with conflicting definitions and connotations
        developed to describe gold and gold coloring processes. Notably, the
        author-practitioner does not use the word imitation or counterfeit
        (<em>contrefaict)</em> to describe any of the gold color recipes in the
        manuscript.<a href="#fn57"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref57"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>57</sup></a> This suggests that he does not
        consider gold colors, <em>or couleur</em>, <em>couleur dor</em>, <em>la
            couleur de lor</em>, to be fakes or imitations of gold.<a
           href="#fn58"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref58"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>58</sup></a> Rather, it seems gold color and
        gold metal are distinct yet closely linked ontological entities. Ms. Fr.
        640 illustrates the complexity of the author-practitioner’s relationship
        to the materiality of gold. He refers to gold over 150 times in multiple
        forms including gold color, gold leaf, and gold metal in the context of
        metal casting.<a href="#fn59"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref59"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>59</sup></a></p>
    <p>The ambiguity of the language surrounding gold, as seen through the lens
        of <em>or mat</em>, makes evident the complexity of the problem.
        Philological analysis of written techniques provides an elaborate
        explanation for what the term <em>or mat</em> means. Likewise,
        reconstruction of the technique provides insight into the sources of
        these ambiguities but does not clearly distinguish process from
        material. What becomes clear is that the histories of the process for
        and the materials of <em>or mat</em> are inextricable from each other,
        and this fact must be considered before any attempt to translate or
        decipher it and similar terms.<a href="#fn60"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref60"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>60</sup></a></p>
    <p>Consideration of these ambiguities as indications of a complex and
        interrelated conceptual system of understanding and interacting with
        gold helps to circumvent the unhelpful dichotomy between material and
        process. <em>Or mat</em> does not simply refer to “mordant gilding” or
        “matte-finished gold,” but rather to a multivalent system of layered
        meaning <em>and</em> material—that is, meanings inextricable from
        material—that are best understood in relation to each other. In the case
        of <em>or mat</em>, this layering begins with the surface treatment of
        the frame, layered with animal skin glue and lamp black which provides a
        stark contrast to the gold, both in color, due to its dark opacity, and
        in finish, due to its gloss after varnish application. Next is the
        mordant layer, which at once imitates gold in color and also contains
        dessicative materials such as the heat-bodied oil and lead-based
        pigments which make the gold grip onto the surface. The gold leaf is the
        third layer which, despite its thickness, acquires a bright color from
        the gold color of the mordant and also diffusely scatters light due to
        its uneven, unburnished surface texture, caused by the dessicative
        properties of the mordant. The fourth and final layer protects the gold
        from water damage and tarnishing and offers specific optical properties
        that add to the gold’s brilliance and its <em>éclat</em>.</p>
    <p>While in its modern translation <em>or mat</em> might refer to any gold
        surface that has a matte finish, I would suggest that for the early
        modern artisan, the author-practitioner included, this was not in fact
        the case. <em>Or mat</em> referred to the optical effect created through
        this specific mordant gilding technique, and all of the steps and
        materials involved contributed to the substance-process of <em>or
            mat.</em> The material’s optical effect and the process of creating
        it can only be understood within a system that does not distinguish the
        one from the other. It is when an attempt is made to rationalize the
        two, separately and distinctly, that “wild philologies” occur.<a

                <p>Within the context of gilding, a mordant refers to the

                    other flat surface. This mordant is generally oil-based but
                    can also contain plant gums or glair, and the user usually
                    mixes this oil with dessicative ingredients (like lead-based
                    pigments and verdigris) to make the mordant more adhesive.

                    the author-practitioner gives a recipe for a water-resistant
                    varnish used for painted banners and signs that one carries
                    in the rain, which he calls Flanders varnish. The manuscript
                    recorded by Sir Theodore Turquet de Mayerne around 1620
                    includes a number of varnish recipes after his discussion of
                    gilding. More research is needed to compare the De Mayerne

                <p>Cennini’s text is believed to have been written at the turn
                    of the fifteenth century and to have circulated widely. The
                    similarity between Cennini’s recipe and the notes made by
                    the author-practitioner is quite pronounced, and I wonder if
                    the author-practitioner, or the source from which he
                    received the <em>or mat</em> recipe, might be responding
                    directly to Cennini. It appears from these two recipes that
                    the use of verdigris in the oil mordant was a contentious
                    subject. See Cennini, <em>Cennino Cennini’s Il libro
