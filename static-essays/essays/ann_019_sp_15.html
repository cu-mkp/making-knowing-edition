        <div>
            <p>Among the several entries devoted to varnish in Ms. Fr. 640, the

                is exclusively about varnish for lutes. Yet what makes for the
                specificity of this varnish? What is the purpose of its
                distinctively red color? By reconstructing the recipe “Varnish
                for lutes,” this essay examines the properties and the meaning
                of varnish for stringed instruments.</p>

    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>Twenty-first-century stringed instruments,
        often constructed using modern industrial techniques rather than in an
        artisan’s workshop, are prized for their brilliance of tone and volume.
        In the early modern period, however, instruments were quieter. They
        employed different strings and performance techniques, and they were
        invariably made in workshops by skilled craftsmen. The recipe for a
        “varnish for lutes” on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/98r/f/98r/tl"><u>98r</u></a>
        in BnF Ms. Fr. 640 is an intriguing inclusion in a manuscript otherwise
        mostly preoccupied with the arts of mold making, casting, and painting.
        That the varnish described in the recipe above is for a <em>red</em>
        varnish makes it even more interesting, as red was not a common color
        for instruments, and it had, moreover, strong cultural connotations and
        technical implications.<a href="#fn1"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref1"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> From a technical perspective,
        modern luthiers insist that the composition of a varnish can change the
        sound of an instrument—the German master Sourène Arakélian, for
        instance, wrote in 1981 that “the student violin of today, factory-made,
        with dry hard varnish, can only give out strident and sour sounds […]
        The function of the varnish is not only to preserve the instrument
        against humidity and manual perspiration, but also to improve its
        tone.”<a href="#fn2"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref2"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> Though Arakélian claims that the
        influence of varnish alone has been exaggerated, and that its qualities
        work in tandem with those of the wood to produce the instrument’s tone,
        color remains an important aesthetic decision, one that the luthier
        ultimately makes to “suit his taste.” Intriguingly, a violin left
        unvarnished is described by Arakélian as “white,” a color that
        apparently has its own aural qualities.<a href="#fn3"

    <p>Our goal for this essay is to better understand the skills necessary to
        make or decorate a musical instrument today and also to open a
        discussion on the nature and experience of color in early modern
        artisanal practice. While our experiment protocols and use of certain
        ingredients clarified the former, the latter is still a topic very much
        up for debate.</p>

    <p>A European or Near-Eastern lute is a plucked stringed instrument with a
        deep, rounded back and wide neck. Its origins are classical, and
        archival sources indicate that it was established in Spain no later than
        the ninth century, with the first known written music for it appearing
        around 1500 (<i><u>Fig. 1</u></i>).<a href="#fn4"

        instruments which have survived to the present day (albeit often in
        highly specialized performance environments) including the oud, the
        theorbo, the archlute, and the kobza, among others. A fantastic variety
        of sizes, shapes, and string numbers is obvious in any collection of
        pre-high classical instruments; it is possible to find lutes of the
        period of 1600–1800 with anywhere from six to twelve strings in a
        variety of tunings.<a href="#fn5"

        subject in contemporary paintings, possessing a range of symbolic
        meanings, and engravings show it in relation to the instrument maker’s

    <p>There are dozens of mentions of various varnishes in Ms. Fr. 640. The
        majority of these are varnishes meant for the surface of paintings, such
        as those listed on fols. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/4r/f/4r/tl"><u>4r</u></a>-<a

        and <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/60v/f/60v/tl"><u>60v</u></a>.
        Varnishes can also be applied to objects other than paintings, such as
        “boxes covered with painted paper” (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/67r/f/67r/tl"><u>67r</u></a>),
        engraved iron (fol. <a

        and sword hilts (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/96r/f/96r/tl"><u>96r</u></a>).
        Varnishes seem to function both as protection, when they completely
        cover and finish an object, and as a conscious aesthetic choice on the
        part of the artisan.<a href="#fn7"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref7"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> They are likewise a common
        material in other contemporary sources, although neither Vannoccio
        Biringuccio, nor Cennino Cennini, nor Hugh Plat, authors of other
        technical writings, mention varnishes for decorating musical
        instruments.<a href="#fn8"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref8"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> Likewise, general historical
        works on the development of musical instruments in the period, although
        often concerned with the physical form of stringed instruments,
        including those in the viola da gamba family, the lyra da braccia, the
        violin, and the crwth, have traditionally ignored the question of how a
        varnish might affect the production of music, either aesthetically or
        scientifically.<a href="#fn9"

    <p>More recently, however, there have appeared works of historical
        reconstruction, akin to those we of the Making and Knowing Project.
        Scholars have conducted (and published) experiments, for example, on the
        stripping and examination of “the earliest surviving set of English
        string instruments” that had been made by a craftsman named William
        Baker.<a href="#fn10"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref10"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> A reconstruction of a lute from
        scratch using early modern illustrations and instructions likewise has
        much to say about the preparation and carving of wood, but unfortunately
        little to say about varnishes, other than that an egg wash might have
        been used to give a “blond” finish to an instrument.<a href="#fn11"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref11"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> Elsewhere, scholar Frank Della
        Torre has briefly mentioned that “cheap” varnishes were preferable to
        expensive ones in the making of violins in early eighteenth-century
        Italy; from this he concludes that certain imported varnishes may have
        “damp[ened] out the upper harmonies” or that it was the use of a
        particular type of varnish which might have produced that ever-famous
        Stradivarius sound.<a href="#fn12"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref12"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> Despite these mentions, it is
        far more common to see varnishes for <em>paintings</em> described in art
        historical literature. All this research, however, carries a common
        theme: a varnish’s composition can fundamentally alter the aesthetic of
        a work of art, and, if one is to extend that to musical instruments, an
        instrument’s sound as well.<a href="#fn13"

    </h2>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>Many of the manuscript’s varnish
        recipes—including those meant for painting canvases or nearly any other
        object apart from lutes—use similar ingredients (mastic, amber,
        turpentine, or aspic oil) and have overlapping or complementary
        techniques, such as heating the base liquid. The recipe on 98r is little
        more than a list of ingredients: “They take a little turpentine, &amp;
        oil of turpentine or of spike lavender, &amp; amber pulverized &amp;
        passed very subtly, &amp; make like that of mastic, &amp; add in a
        little dragon’s blood to color it and make it reddish, and others some
        <em>terra merita</em> for yellow.”<a href="#fn14"

           id="fnref14"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> These materials—turpentine oil
        or spike lavender oil, ground amber, and “dragon’s blood” resin (which
        could be obtained from a number of different plant genera including

        searched the lutes in the online collection of the Metropolitan Museum
        of Art and were able to pull up a list of ninety-seven instruments which
        were both of European origin and built between 1600 and 1800. Even a
        cursory examination of their details showed us that by far the most

        The former states: “put in 4 ℥ of sandarac &amp; mastic subtly
        pulverized. And first, boil your oil in a pot on a chafing dish, and
        then mix in little by little the aforesaid gums, stirring continually
        with a small stick split and quartered at the tip.” Combining this
        information with our initial recipe, we determined that we should heat
        our base liquid and ground amber together. Another varnish recipe on
        fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/73v/f/73v/tl"><u>73v</u></a>
        provided us with a more concrete ratio of ingredients to test (“two
        ounces of spike lavender oil &amp; one ounce of sandarac”), thus, for
        our recipe, two parts liquid to one part amber. Some recipes mentioned
        merely that this liquid combination should be “heated,” while others
        mentioned “boiling” (for example, “chaufer” in the entry “Varnish of
        spike lavender oil” on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/4r/f/4r/tl"><u>4r</u></a>
        vs. “bouillir” in “Black varnish for sword guard, bands for trunks,
        &amp;c” on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/4v/f/4v/tl"><u>4v</u></a>).
        We decided to “heat” our mixture. The original recipe did not mention
        specific shades of color, so we decided to take our heated mixtures off
        the heat and stir in however much coloring agent (turmeric powder or
        powdered dragon’s blood resin) we felt gave the varnishes enough
        color.<a href="#fn18"

        bases and two coloring agents to try, we ran our experiment four times:

            <blockquote>

        <li>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Turpentine oil and dragon’s blood → red</p>
            </blockquote>
        </li>
        <li>
            <blockquote>

            </blockquote>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Our first step was to grind our solid ingredients as finely as we could.
        The dragon’s blood resin crumbled quickly and easily, and it did not
        need to be sieved to become very fine (<i><u>Fig.6</u></i>). In
        contrast, grinding the amber pieces was very hard work, and the resin
        never quite reached a truly fine state despite being sieved several
        times; there were always larger, coarser pieces visible in the final
        powdered form (<i><u>Fig. 7</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 8</u></i>). Our turmeric
        powder was a store bought foodstuff. We then heated a hot plate under a
        fume hood (to help deal with the strong smell of our oils) to what we
        thought would be a boiling temperature (a setting of 4 out of 5) and
        started our first experiment with turpentine oil. We combined 3 ounces
        of turpentine oil with 1.5 oz of ground amber and stirred continuously
        with a handmade tool of iron wire. Almost immediately, the turpentine
        oil—which has a boiling point of ~307°F<a href="#fn19"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref19"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a>—began to smoke and boil, and the
        amber started to solidify into a dark brown sludge in the turpentine.
        Within moments, the clearly too-high heat had boiled away the turpentine
        and left us with a crusty mess of foul-smelling amber dust. An
        acknowledged failure (<i><u>Fig. 9</u></i>)!</p>

    <p>For our subsequent attempts, we decided to keep our hot plate on its
        minimum setting and to monitor the temperature of the liquids with an
        infrared thermometer. On our second attempt with the first mixture, the
        turpentine rose rapidly to a temperature of about 125°F, at which point
        we poured in the 1.5 oz of amber and began to stir; its temperature
        eventually stabilized between 140 and 150°F. Though we stirred the
        mixture for several minutes, the amber did not seem to be incorporating
        into the oil,<a href="#fn20"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref20"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> and it did not change its sludgy
        brown-black color (<i><u>Fig. 10</u></i>). We therefore decided to
        strain the mixture before calling it complete. After more than five
        minutes without changes, we took the varnish off the heat and started to
        stir in the turmeric, stopping when we felt we had a robust yellow
        color. We then strained the varnish through cheesecloth to remove most
        of the amber pieces and stored it in a glass jar (<i><u>Fig. 11</u></i>).</p>

    <p>The remaining three experiments proceeded almost exactly as above, with
        the only difference being the variations in color produced by similar
        amounts of coloring agent (and our two red varnishes were stored in tin
        cans rather than in glass jars). Each was heated to approximately 150°F
        and stirred for several minutes, colored, and strained. Our results were

    <p>On the advice of luthier Gabriela Guadalajara, we looked through the
        manuscript for clues as to what might be used as a sealant for the
        instrument’s wood before the varnish was applied to it.<a href="#fn21"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref21"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a> The manuscript mentions glue
        dozens of times, again frequently in reference to painting, but has very
        few actual recipes for it beyond that of fish glue on fol. <a

           id="fnref22"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a> We therefore looked for synonyms
        and focused briefly on mastic, a resin obtained from the mastic tree
        (<em>Pistacia lentiscus</em>) and commonly known as “arabic gum”—not to
        be confused with “gum arabic” or “acacia gum” (<em>Sengalia senegal</em>
        or <em>Vachellia seyal</em>).</p>
    <p>Due to time and price concerns, we decided to seal our sample piece of
        spruce with liquid gum arabic instead, which can be used to thicken inks
        and paints and was already present in our lab.<a href="#fn23"
           class="footnote-ref"

           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/3v/f/3v/tl"><u>3v</u></a>,
        we found mention of different varnish applications. The
        author-practitioner explains,</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Turpentine varnish does not need any glue because it is fatty &amp;
            viscous &amp; it is not absorbed in the wood like that of spike
            lavender &amp; sandarac. Also, that of spike lavender does not
            require any glue on iron &amp; similar things that do not absorb.
            But on wood &amp; on colors which <del>have</del> <sup>do not
                have</sup> gum or distemper glue, it is necessary to lay one
            coat of the said hide glue &amp; to let it dry &amp; to varnish.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>We decided to test all four varnishes on
        one piece of sealed spruce, and then test all four on a piece of
        unsealed spruce. (This would not be modern practice; Guadalajara told us
        one would never varnish without sealing beforehand.)</p>
    <p>We briefly sanded each piece of spruce to take off a slightly rough top
        layer before we painted one with a single layer of gum arabic and let it
        dry for half an hour (<i><u>Fig. 16</u></i>). After labeling, we then
        painted each of the four colors in straight lines on both spruce pieces.
        To our disappointment, although the “red” varnishes had looked quite red
        to our eyes when they were in the jars, they appeared barely brown when
        used to paint and were practically invisible on the piece of sealed
        spruce. The yellow varnishes showed color much more obviously but were
        still rather weak. By far the strongest color was the spike lavender oil
        and turmeric mix, which, as we had already noticed while mixing it,
        appeared as near-neon also on the wood. All four varnishes spread
        quickly and widely across both pieces of wood despite only being painted
        in narrow strips. In fact, the varnishes spread even further on the
        sealed piece than the non-sealed piece; we suspect this may have been
        because gum arabic is water-soluble, and the sealant may not have been
        completely dry (<i><u>Fig. 17</u></i>).</p>

        &amp; turmeric varnish showed strongly on the sealed spruce. On the
        unsealed spruce, the neon mixture was practically garish, but the
        turpentine and turmeric, turpentine and dragon’s blood, and spike
        lavender and dragon’s blood varnishes began to display more pleasing
        traits. Though not red, the two dragon’s blood varnishes eventually
        approximated a typical brown one might see on many stringed instruments
        today. Likewise, the turpentine and turmeric mixture created a far more
        palatable golden-yellow shade, which would not look too out of place on
        a lute or an oud. All four varnishes continued to spread rapidly across
        the wood although we had painted them using very little liquid. The
        author’s point about turpentine oil taking better to unsealed wood was
        well demonstrated: on the spruce, these varnishes both displayed better
        color and spread less than the spike lavender oil varnishes (<i><u>Fig. 18</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 19</u></i>).</p>

    <h2 id="questions-and-suggestions">Questions and Suggestions</h2>
    <p>Our reconstruction sought to answer two main questions. Our first
        question was about the workshop context of building, decorating, and
        perhaps maintaining early modern stringed instruments. The overlap of
        materials among the multiple varnish recipes in the manuscript suggests
        that a painter, used to preparing and finishing canvases, would be equal
        to the task of varnishing an instrument, likely having the necessary
        resources at hand. The varnishes might also have been made in a
        luthier’s workshop. The procedure for making the varnishes, assuming we
        designed our protocols correctly, was simple enough that they could be
        made quickly and easily, provided the materials were available.</p>
    <p>Our second major inquiry was to determine the steps necessary to produce
        colors suited to the decoration of an instrument. This is a subjective
        question: what, after all, are the characteristics of a color that make
        it aesthetically pleasing on the body of an instrument? If the
        experience of color is a subjective experience—both visually and
        emotionally—how are we to decide what shades are appropriate for a given
        situation, or indeed whether we have even approximated the shade
        intended by the author-practitioner? In the end, we discovered that our
        liquid varnishes, although they appeared to be strongly colored,
        immediately weakened in brilliance upon application. These experiments
        may shed light on the processes involved in instrument making and the
        making of colored varnish, but whether we can define them as a success
        or a failure remains open to debate. Further research could include
        investigating possibilities for sealants; using less ground amber to
        improve color, or experimenting with grinding more finely to see whether
        that improves its incorporation into the heated liquid base; using more
        dragon’s blood to try to strengthen the “red” varnishes; and continuing
        to investigate the coloring capacities of “terra merita.”</p>

                <p>This statement is partly based on the experience of this
                    essay’s author as a string player, and on a sampling of
                    early modern instruments housed in the Metropolitan Museum
                    of Art (see below), which mostly range in color from
                    brightly golden-yellow to shades of rich, dark brown. These
                    observations are necessarily subjective (see final section
                    of this essay for more on color and subjectivity).<a

                <p>Interestingly, Cennino Cennini, in his brief section on
                    varnishes for paintings, writes that one should hold off on
                    varnishing for as long as possible before applying it as it
                    will ruin the color and “freshness” of a work of art if
                    applied right away once made/the painting is ready. Clearly,
                    however, this does not apply to the treatment of
                    instruments, though the question of time and whether the
                    wood would need time to adjust to its environment is a good
                    one. Early instruments, and indeed modern instruments made
                    in old styles, are frequently more apt to warp, crack, or
                    otherwise react badly to their environments even when fully
                    varnished and properly maintained. Cennino Cennini, <em>The

                <p>This brought up an intriguing question—one far too large to
                    try to answer in this essay—about how, exactly, the
                    author-practitioner could possibly have described an exact
                    shade of color as he experienced it to his reader or
                    apprentice in such a way that a follower of his work could
                    then exactly reproduce it. Since so much of the
                    <em>experiencing</em> of color is subjective, can words
                    alone ever convey a particular shade with certainty?<a

                <p>Guadalajara is a New York-based luthier who builds her own
                    instruments and maintains both modern and early stringed
                    instruments. She studied violin-making in her native Mexico
                    at the studio of Luthfi Becker as well as with the
                    Tri-State’s premier luthier for gambas, William Monical,
                    before his retirement. Very interestingly, she told us that
                    the composition or creation of varnishes had never been a
                    part of her own lengthy training, and in her experience the
                    application of it was likewise something learned
                    instinctively rather than having any hard/fast or teachable
                    rules. For more on Guadalajara, see her website, Gabriela’s

                    is also water-soluble, even if we had indeed made the effort
