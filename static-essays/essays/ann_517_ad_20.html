        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <div>
            <p>In the entry “Varnish resistant to water” on fol. <a
                   href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/31r/f/31r/tl"><span
                          class="underline">31r</span></a> of BnF Ms. Fr. 640,
                the author-practitioner describes what conservators today
                recognize as two types of varnish: spirit-based and oil-based.
                Moreover, he claims that the former resist the rain while latter
                do not. An experiment was designed to test these claims,
                informed by previous canvas preparation and varnish making
                experiments in the Making and Knowing lab. A test canvas,
                painted with oil paints and covered with four varnishes arranged
                side by side, was exposed to the elements May 30–Oct 18, 2018,
                and then compared to a control version kept indoors. Preliminary
                results suggest that the spirit varnishes are indeed better able
                to withstand rain than their oil-based counterparts; however, an
                unvarnished strip of the test canvas faired nearly as well as
                the spirit varnish, suggesting that the “Varnish resistant to
                water” may not have been intended to cover oil paint but another
                medium—perhaps distemper. Additional experiments are needed.</p>

    <p>In sixteenth-century Europe, civic life was characterized by spectacle
        and display. Artists found reliable work in the preparation of vibrant
        ephemeral architecture, floats, banners, placards, pennants, puppets,
        and other materials that could embellish a city and its citizenry on
        special occasions and across multi-day celebrations<a href="#fn1"

           id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> (<i><span class="underline">Fig.

    <blockquote>
        <p>Flanders varnish, made with turpentine &amp; oil of turpentine or
            mastic, can come off and does not hold up in the rain. But that made
            with white walnut oil, as you have done, holds in the rain [and] is
            very clear &amp; beautiful &amp; dries soon. This is why one uses
            this one for painted banners &amp; signs that one carries in the
            rain.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>These few sentences convey several important points. First, water
        resistance was a desired feature of some artworks. Second, painters
        could achieve water resistance by selecting an appropriate varnish as a
        top coat. And third, “Flanders varnish” is undone in wet weather but
        varnish made from white walnut oil holds up. Water-resistant varnishes
        reappear as a subject of interest elsewhere in the manuscript. A
        marginal note on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/3r/f/3r/tl"><span
                  class="underline">3r</span></a> also compares two varnishes
        for their storm-worthiness, mentioning that “mastic varnish does not
        resist rain, whereas that of oil and rosin does.”</p>
    <p>We might be tempted to read such varnish comparisons as simple
        declarations about what resists the rain and what does not. After all,
        there was an established need for some painted wares to be ready for all
        weather. Nevertheless, read in the context of the history of art
        materials and technologies, these comparisons may be more significant.
        The author-practitioner may be moving toward a larger, categorical
        claim. The mention of “oil of turpentine” as a key ingredient in
        “Flanders varnish” on fol. 31r reflects a contemporary artisanal
        innovation: the advent of spirit-based varnishes. And the marginal note
        on fol. 3r about the rain-vulnerable mastic varnish is embedded in an
        entry on another spirit-based varnish. It may be that a central aim of
        “Varnish resistant to water” was to help define the limitations of the
        new and increasingly accessible category of spirit-based varnishes.
        Nevertheless, questions remain. What exactly was this “Flanders
        varnish,” and how was it made? What, exactly, was the one “made with
        white walnut oil”? And did they really behave in the rain as reported?
    </p>
    <p>On its own, “Varnish resistant to water” addresses varnish types and
        their properties rather than provides a recipe for making them. By
        consulting other entries in the manuscript, we can arrive at plausible
        conclusions about the nature and composition of the varnishes. The
        varnishes can then be reconstructed with some degree of
        confidence—enough at least to test, however preliminarily, the
        author-practitioner’s claims about their water resistance.
        Reconstruction and testing of these varnishes can also provide some
        initial insight into the emerging shift from oil-based to spirit-based
        varnishes in sixteenth-century Europe.</p>
    <h2 id="varnish">Varnish</h2>
    <p>A varnish is a transparent, protective coating most often made from
        resins in solution that, once applied to a surface, dries into a hard
        film.<a href="#fn4"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> When applied to a painting, a varnish
        can help seal water-soluble and fugitive pigments, bring uniformity to
        the outer surface of the artwork, and impart an overall gloss.<a
           href="#fn5"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Until the sixteenth century, the most
        common varnishes applied over paint were oil-based or “fat” varnishes,
        made from resins of various kinds (e.g., mastic, sandarac, juniper
        resin, turpentine oleoresins, and colophony) dissolved in a heated
        drying oil, such as linseed, hemp, or nut oil.<a href="#fn6"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Such varnishes could have a yellow or
        green tint, depending on the oil that was used, and this tint could
        alter the perception of the painted colors beneath. This color
        alteration is often addressed in artist treatises, including in Ms. Fr.
        640 on fol. 3r, where a recommended varnish “is appropriate for panel
        paintings and other painted things without corrupting the colors or
        yellowing.” Over the course of the sixteenth century, spirit-based or
        “lean” varnishes were introduced into artisanal practice. These were
        composed of resins dissolved in alcohol or a volatile oil (such as spike
        lavender oil).<a href="#fn7"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> They became common among painters
        because their underlying solvents imparted less color to the varnish.
        They were also easier and safer to make, requiring lower temperatures in
        their production. They also tended to dry quickly and have less
        viscosity or body, making them easier to handle.<a href="#fn8"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> In this period, there also existed a
        third, intermediary category of “mixed” or “semi-fat” varnishes,

    <p>In “Varnish resistant to water” on fol. 31r, the author-practitioner
        contrasts two types of varnish: “Flanders varnish,” a term that he
        applies to two different material preparations, and an unnamed varnish
        made with “white walnut oil.” The following sections attempt to unravel
        the composition of each in order to develop working recipes for
        experimental reconstruction and outdoor testing. In these sections, we
        lay out our thought process and rationale—sometimes rather
        exhaustively—in order to draw attention to the irresolvable ambiguities
        and uncertainties of interpreting historical technical texts. In the 450
        years between the penning of Ms. Fr. 640 and our engagement with it,
        materials have changed (e.g., flax and walnuts have evolved or been
        genetically modified), processes have changed (e.g., industrial
        production has reduced product variability), and meanings of words have
        changed (e.g., <em>turpentine</em>). We believe that it is critical to
        be as transparent as possible about our interpretive process.</p>
    <h2 id="interpretation-flanders-varnish">Interpretation: “Flanders Varnish”
    </h2>
    <p>The entry “Varnish resistant to water” notes the existence of a “Flanders
        varnish, made with turpentine &amp; oil of turpentine or mastic…” but
        mentions little else other than its vulnerability to rain. But what
        exactly is this “Flanders varnish”? Is it one varnish or is it a general
        category of varnishes commonly used in Flanders? The greatest difficulty
        with interpretation arises when trying to reconcile the grammar of the
        sentence with what we know of varnishes and their composition (i.e.,
        resins dissolved in either a drying oil or in an alcohol or volatile
        oil).</p>
    <p>Three materials are mentioned: turpentine, oil of turpentine, and mastic.
        The grammar suggests that mastic is either being given as a synonym of
        oil of turpentine or as an alternative to it. Since “oil of turpentine”
        is materially distinct from “mastic”—that is, not synonymous—we can
        assume that the author-practitioner is referring to the existence of two
        alternative versions of “Flanders varnish.” The first and most clearly
        discernible version is made from turpentine and oil of turpentine. The
        composition of the second version is less clear. Given the grammar, the
        most obvious reading would propose a varnish made from turpentine and
        mastic, but as we will see, this is not the likely meaning. A second
        reading would propose a varnish made simply of mastic, but mastic, a
        resin, needs to be added to a drying oil or a volatile oil to become a
        varnish proper, so this possibility can be dismissed. A third reading
        would propose a varnish made from turpentine and oil of mastic, but such
        a material does not appear in any other varnish recipes.<a href="#fn10"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> A fourth reading would propose any
        varnish that is made with mastic and some other ingredient, prepared in
        a manner that the reader is assumed to already know. But, if this mastic
        varnish is somehow comparable to the “turpentine &amp; oil of
        turpentine” “Flanders varnish” (wherein a resin or oleoresin is
        dissolved in a volatile oil), then the mastic varnish is presumably also
        made with a volatile oil.</p>
    <p>Our reading, however grammatically awkward, would propose that the second
        “Flanders varnish” is made of oil of turpentine and mastic. A quick
        digression to clarify the meaning of the term “turpentine” can shed
        light on why this reading is the most viable.</p>
    <p>Turpentine is a term applied, often without adequate precision, to
        describe the first two of these three closely related materials:</p>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>
            <blockquote>
                <p>The sticky sap or oleoresin exuded from coniferous trees,

                    This sap is also known as balsam, turpentine gum, or gum
                    thus, though it is sometimes simply referred to as
                    turpentine, particularly in historical sources.<a

                    product is also known as turpentine oil, oil of turpentine,
                    spirits of turpentine, or turps, though it is sometimes
                    simply referred to as turpentine, particularly in modern and
                    industrial contexts where it is often used and marketed as a
                    paint thinner.<a href="#fn12"
                       class="footnote-ref"
                       id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>

        <li>
            <blockquote>
                <p>The solid, resinous residue that remains after distilling
                    this same sap. This product is also known as rosin,

                       class="footnote-ref"
                       id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Such residues sometimes
                    constitute the resins in varnish recipes.</p>
            </blockquote>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>With this in mind, we interpret the
        “turpentine” of the “Flanders varnish” to refer to the oleoresin or sap
        from a conifer because “oil of turpentine” unambiguously refers to the
        volatile oil produced from the distillation of an oleoresin.</p>
    <p>The mention of “oil of turpentine” and the absence of any drying oil such
        as linseed oil or walnut oil in the description of “Flanders varnish” is
        revealing. This suggests that “Flanders varnish” is not a “fat”
        oil-based varnish; rather, it is likely a “lean” spirit-based varnish
        or, possibly, a “mixed” varnish of oleoresin and spirits. The
        author-practitioner’s first version of “Flanders varnish” (i.e., the one
        “made with turpentine &amp; oil of turpentine”) is most likely made from
        a mixture of oleoresin (i.e., sap or balsam) and turpentine oil,
        yielding a “mixed” varnish. The second version of “Flanders varnish” is
        most likely made from mastic (a resin) and turpentine oil, yielding a
        “lean” varnish. Thus, in our interpretation, the “or mastic” of the
        manuscript entry functions like an afterthought, by which the
        author-practitioner makes a material analogy between the oleoresin
        turpentine and the resin mastic as materials that can be dissolved in
        oil of turpentine to produce a varnish. The author-practitioner does not
        seem to make the same fine-grained distinction between “mixed” and
        “lean” spirit-based varnishes that art conservators do today.</p>
    <p>In conclusion, the phrase “Flanders varnish, made with turpentine &amp;
        oil of turpentine or mastic…” seems to refer to two spirit-based
        varnishes made by dissolving turpentine and mastic respectively in oil
        of turpentine. We can surmise that “Flanders varnish” was a category of
        varnish characterized by the use of volatile oils, and it may have been
        more common in Flanders at the time than it was in France. Regardless, a
        plausible recipe for making either of these “Flanders varnishes” can
        only be gleaned contextually from the rest of the manuscript.</p>
    <h3 id="turpentine-varnish">Turpentine Varnish</h3>
    <p>According to our interpretation above, the first version of “Flanders
        varnish” is a “mixed” turpentine varnish combining the oleoresin
        turpentine with the volatile oil known as turpentine oil. The entry
        “Varnish resistant to water” (fol. 31r) does not indicate the precise
        materials and quantities needed for making turpentine varnish.<a
           href="#fn14"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> The entry “Frames of the Germans”

        the making of a “clear turpentine varnish,” “namely half turpentine oil
        &amp; almost half turpentine.” Unfortunately, the entries on fols. 31r
        and 61v do not specify the variety of turpentine to be used, in contrast
        to a great number of other varnish recipes in the manuscript that
        require “Venice turpentine” in particular.<a href="#fn15"
           class="footnote-ref"

        attestation of their use in picture varnishes across several historical
        recipe texts, both are strong candidates for use in the “Flanders

    <h3 id="mastic-varnish">Mastic Varnish</h3>
    <p>We interpret the second version of “Flanders varnish” in the entry
        “Varnish resistant to water” (fol. 31r) to be a “lean,” spirit-based
        mastic varnish made from the resin mastic dissolved in turpentine oil.
        There are several competing recipes for spirit-based mastic varnishes
        across the manuscript in addition to those for oil-based mastic varnish
        and varnishes that include mastic as one additive among several.<a

        suggest adding eau-de-vie, and the former recipe also adds turpentine
        balsam. Nevertheless, these additives appear to be optional; “Varnish

        to put in turpentine, but only its white turpentine oil &amp; mastic
        pulverized at your discretion, until it has enough body.” As for the
        desired consistency, “one knows that this varnish does not have body
        enough when it does not take well on a panel in oil, for it is like
        water” (97v); it has enough body “when, being placed on a knife in the
        wind, it does not run” (60v). The varnish can be made thicker by adding
        more mastic and thinner by adding more turpentine oil (97v).</p>
    <h2 id="interpretation-varnish-made-with-white-walnut-oil">Interpretation:
        Varnish Made with White Walnut Oil</h2>
    <p>The author-practitioner contrasts the two spirit-based “Flanders
        varnishes,” which purportedly fail in wet weather, with “that made with
        white walnut oil, as you have done,” which “holds in the rain.” The
        phrase “as you have done” suggests that either 1) a reader of the entry
        is presumed to already possess the knowledge of making varnish and can
        use their go-to recipe for walnut oil-based varnish for the purpose of
        waterproofing; or that 2) a recipe for the relevant white walnut oil
        picture varnish lies somewhere within Ms. Fr. 640. This second
        suggestion is misleading; no such recipe exists.<a href="#fn22"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> There are varnish recipes made with
        walnut oil, but they concern coloring objects with varnish: a red
        varnish is used to imitate coral (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/3r/tl"><span

        decoration of armor (fol. <a

                  class="underline">4v</span></a>), black varnishes as ground
        layers for etching (fol. 4v), and a pseudo-varnish for armor that is
        produced by using heat to polymerize walnut oil applied directly to
        metal (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/96v/f/96v/tl"><span
                  class="underline">96v</span></a>). The closest thing to a
        recipe for water-resistant varnish comes in a marginal note on fol. 3r:
        “mastic varnish does not resist rain, whereas that of oil and rosin
        does.” This off-hand comment at least suggests to us that the principal
        constituents of the water-resistant white walnut oil varnish are likely
        walnut oil and rosin (<em>rousine</em>). In another marginal note on
        fol. 3r, the author-practitioner writes that “colophony is nothing other
        than recooked rosin (<em>rousine</em>), and on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/3v/f/3v/tl"><span
                  class="underline">3v</span></a>, he identifies colophony as
        the residue left behind after distilling oil of turpentine.</p>
    <p>From these contextual details, we interpret the water-resistant varnish
        made with “white walnut oil” to be a “fat,” oil-based varnish made of
        walnut oil and colophony.<a href="#fn23"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> However, one particular difficulty
        here is the meaning of “white” (<em>blanche</em>) in “white walnut oil.”
        We have not found reference to white walnut oil in any other art
        technical source. We propose three possible meanings of “white”: 1)
        lacking or having transparency, 2) lacking color (no obvious tint or
        hue), and 3) lacking impurities and inclusions.</p>
    <p>On fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/60r/f/60r/tl"><span
                  class="underline">60r</span></a>, the author-practitioner
        writes that “walnut oil extracted like peeled almonds is very white,”
        and on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/57v/f/57v/tl"><span
                  class="underline">57v</span></a>, a distinction is drawn
        between walnut oil that is clear and walnut oil that is white: “4- or
        5-year-old walnut oil which is clear (<em>cler</em>) is the best color,
        it keeps off dust. The kind which has recently been drawn with the press
        in the manner of almond oil is white (<em>blanc</em>), especially if the
        walnuts’ skin is removed.” It is noteworthy that the first of these two
        sentences is written by a scribe and the second is in the
        author-practitioner’s own hand. Cold-pressed walnut oil, when freshly
        pressed, is mildly opaque, though it becomes lighter and clearer with
        filtration and/or time.<a href="#fn24"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> This freshly-pressed state might be
        what the author-practitioner means by white.</p>
    <p>Complicating our understanding of the author-practitioner’s use of
        “white” is a recipe on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/67v/f/67v/tl"><span
                  class="underline">67v</span></a> for an essential oil
        distilled from a mixture of equal parts of walnut oil and turpentine.
        There is no qualifier for the walnut oil (e.g., white, clear, fresh),
        and the word “walnut” itself is a later addition. The essential oil of
        walnut-turpentine that results from the distillation “renders an essence
        whiter than common water” (<em>plus blanche que leau commune</em>).
        Given that water is not white in any conventional understanding of the
        color, nor are essential oils typically opaque,<a href="#fn25"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> the meaning of “white” walnut oil
        remains unclear. This qualifier may be referring to the clarity and
        transparency of the oil, with a desire for oil to be as transparent as
        water (or even more transparent than “common water”).</p>
    <p>A second interpretation of “white” that is also supported by fol. 67r is
        a description of the walnut oil’s color. While water may not be white,
        it is comparatively not yellow, an important characteristic of the new
        spirit varnishes.<a href="#fn26"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> Oil-based varnishes are known to be
        yellow, changing the colors of any painting to which they are applied.<a
           href="#fn27"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> The author-practitioner discusses the
        advantage of this new class of varnishes on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/4r/tl"><span
                  class="underline">4r</span></a>: “One did not use to varnish
        the landscape of a panel when linseed varnish was in use, because it
        yellowed the landscape. But with that of turpentine, one varnishes
        everywhere.” This comment is followed by an entry dedicated to “removing
        varnish from an old panel that is yellowish &amp; varnishing it anew.”
        Another comment on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/97v/tl"><span
                  class="underline">97v</span></a> advises the reader to apply
        varnish with one’s finger to ensure a “lean layer” and prevent the layer
        from being too thick and thus yellowing. Even before the widespread
        adoption of spirit varnishes, artists began to replace linseed oil with
        walnut and other nut oils specifically because they were less yellow,
        and Ms. Fr. 640 “seems to confirm what the scattered evidence from
        recipes that started appearing in the first decades of the fifteenth
        century already suggested; painters and other artisans were looking to
        replace traditional linseed oil-resin varnishes with materials that were
        less yellow.”<a href="#fn28"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> The description of white walnut oil in
        “Varnishes resistant to rain” may be an oblique comparison between oils,
        given that nut oils are known to have a less yellow hue than linseed
        oil. Compared to the deep yellow of linseed oil, the paler yellow of
        walnut oil could be described as “white,” signifying a lack of color or
        distinctive hue. Admittedly, there is no mention of linseed oil in this
        entry, however, and the use of “white” in any comparison between linseed
        and walnut would be redundant.</p>
    <p>The third possible meaning of “white” lies somewhere in the middle
        between transparency and colorlessness. It could signify the purity of
        the walnut oil, being free of any impurities or other inclusions. The
        need for purified materials is treated at length by Marjolijn Bol, who
        discusses the author-practitioner’s detailed account on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/97v/f/97v/tl"><span
                  class="underline">97v</span></a> about obtaining mastic,
        another varnish ingredient, that is “white and purified” (<em>blanc
            &amp; purifie</em>).<a href="#fn29"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> When mastic is collected in small
        tears, “dirt and dust and black dross” (fol. 97v) can still be present,
        and these impurities will be noticeable in any varnish made with mastic
        that has not been purified or cleaned. Mastic is, after all, an organic
        material collected from plants; inclusions and contaminants are bound to
        happen. The author-practitioner even provides additional steps a reader
        can take to further clean the mastic. Bol describes the state of this
        mastic as “clear (or purified),” suggesting the meaning of “white” to be
        a combination of transparency and purity. The discussion of mastic,
        however, could also support the interpretation of lack of color: like
        walnut oil, mastic has a slight yellow tint (see Fig. 4 for the color of
        walnut oil and Fig. 7 for the color of crushed mastic), and it can
        appear cloudy or contain inclusions. “White,” then, may be closer in
        meaning to “purified,” referring to lack of impurities, while also
        describing the clarity and color of the material.</p>
    <p>Upon reflection, we interpret the “white” of the “white walnut oil” in
        “Varnishes resistant to rain” to mean transparent and colorless. The
        <em>Dictionnaire du Moyen Français</em> supports this possibility.<a
           href="#fn30"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> Additionally, numerous varnish recipes
        in the sixteenth-century artist’s manual known as the Marciana
        manuscript call for “clear nut oil” and “clear linseed oil,” while white
        nut oil or white linseed oil never occur.<a href="#fn31"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> Other recipes in the Marciana
        manuscript advise ways to make oil and varnish clearer. The debate,
        however, is not settled; the author-practitioner of Ms. Fr. 640 uses the
        term <em>cler</em>, which can mean both “bright” and “transparent,” to
        describe walnut oil on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/64r/f/64r/tl"><span
                  class="underline">64r</span></a>, so his vocabulary allows for
        this precision, even if his meaning is not entirely evident on fol. 31r.
    </p>
    <p>In the absence of any obvious recipe in the manuscript for the “varnish
        of white walnut oil,” we decided to base our protocol on the
        reconstruction of historical varnishes in the recent work by Tirat,
        Echard, Lattuati-Derieux, Huerou, and Serfaty supported by the Fondation
        des Sciences du Patrimoine, Université de Cergy-Pontoise.<a href="#fn32"

        of 4 parts linseed oil to 1 part colophony, heated for 100 minutes,

        oil varnishes, the historical recipes they cite call for both linseed

        to three different patterns so that the characteristics and interactions
        of the paints and the eventual varnish layers above them could be better

    <p>The initial ingredients, which varied in state and nature (<i><span

                  class="underline">Fig. 5</span></i>, <i><span

                  class="underline">Fig. 7</span></i>) yielded four varnishes of
        distinct colors (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 8</span></i>). The
        varnishes also ranged in consistency. The Silver Fir varnish, submitted
        to the author-practitioner’s “knife test” (<i><span
                  class="underline">Vid. 1</span></i>) appeared to be slightly
        thin. The mastic varnish was so thick that it poured from its vial with
        exceptional slowness (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 9</span></i>),
        while the Venice Turpentine and Walnut Oil (<i><span
                  class="underline">Fig. 10</span></i>) varnishes were closest
        to the ideal consistency. We considered adjusting the ingredient
        quantities for the sake of achieving a similar consistency across the
        varnishes; however, we decided against this, since it would complicate
        our ability to know the ingredient proportions and quantities with as
        much precision as we did. We decided to apply the varnishes as made,
        with the understanding that this first iteration of the experiment need
        not be the last.</p>

                has the right consistency “when, being placed on a knife in the

                on a pallet knife and blown upon at an angle. The rippling of

    <p>The varnishes were applied with brushes to each canvas in horizontal
        bands so that the varnishes could be compared side by side (<i><span
                  class="underline">Fig. 11</span></i>). Application required
        successive sweeps with the brush to even out the application (<i><span

        prepared so that the effect of the varnishes could be seen over each
        preparatory layer used on the canvas as well as the painted layer
        itself. In effect, the sample canvases were divided into a 4 x 5 grid to
        distinguish the horizontal bands of four varnishes and one unvarnished
        band across the four surface preparations (oil paint, lead white, burnt

        The frame was weighted down with a cast iron pot filled with pieces of

    <p>A variety of effects were observed over the test period. A June 6
        comparison between the tautness of the outdoor canvas (<a
           href="https://vimeo.com/646513444"><span class="underline">Vid.
                3</span></a>) and that of the control (<a
           href="https://vimeo.com/646512739"><span class="underline">Vid.
                4</span></a>) suggests that weather exposure was causing the
        canvas to slacken. White scum began to appear in the two turpentine
        varnishes (i.e., Venice and Silver Fir), and the blue oil paint began to
        run beneath the mastic varnish (<i><span class="underline">Fig.
                17</span></i>). The scumming was particularly widespread and
        apparent by later June (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 18</span></i>),
        though it did fade over the summer. Small dirt particles adhered to some
        varnishes, especially the Silver Fir (<i><span class="underline">Fig.
                19</span></i>), and the mastic varnish gradually took on a more
        yellow tone over time and began to ripple and crack, likely due in part
        to the thickness of the varnish when it was applied (<i><span
                  class="underline">Fig. 20</span></i>). A final comparison
        between the outdoor canvas and the control canvas that was kept indoors
        (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 21</span></i>) shows the effect of
        nearly five months of exposure.<a href="#fn47"

    <h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
    <p>The author-practitioner had drawn a comparison between two types of
        varnish: spirit-based varnishes (those made with either turpentine
        balsam or mastic dissolved in oil of turpentine) and oil-based varnishes
        (rosin dissolved in walnut oil). He asserted that the former were undone
        in the rain while the latter were not. Our experiment, however
        preliminary, suggests that his assertion was correct. The varnish made
        of walnut oil and colophony appears to have withstood five months of
        outdoor conditions (including 27.6 inches of rain) better than any of
        the spirit-based versions. The mastic varnish performed the worst by
        far, but it was also notably more viscous than any of the other
        varnishes, and its resultant thicker application across the canvas
        likely affected the outcome. It is worth noting that the unvarnished
        control strip along the very bottom of the canvas fared nearly as well
        as the strip coated with the walnut oil varnish.</p>
    <p>Given that the unvarnished yet painted section fared comparatively well
        when exposed to the elements for five months, we question whether
        “Varnishes resistant to water” were actually intended to cover oil
        paints; they may have been intended to protect another medium, distemper
        perhaps. It is possible a substrate other than canvas, such as paper,
        would be preserved more fully by this varnish. Future iterations of this
        experiment should attempt to produce varnishes with more uniform
        consistency and should compare the performance of the varnishes over
        paint of different binding media on a variety of substrates.</p>
    <p>Due to their ephemeral nature, the “painted banners &amp; signs that one
        carries in the rain” described by the author-practitioner in “Varnish
        resistant to water” on fol. 31r are not abundant in museum collections
        and archives, nor are they the subject of intense scholarly study. This
        entry in Ms. Fr. 640, however, highlights the practical considerations
        of artisans in creating works of art to be used out of doors in civic
        and religious celebrations and activities. It sheds light on the lost
        art pieces that decorated festivals, processions, and royal entries.
        “Varnish resistant to water” also marks an important technological shift
        in the Renaissance craft workshop: the advent of spirit-based varnishes.
        While the advantages of spirit varnishes and their preferred use over
        oil-based varnishes are attested in Ms. Fr. 640, other technical
        manuals, and in the material record from the later sixteenth century
        onwards, the older oil-based varnishes may still have been superior in
        one way: waterproofing.</p>

                <p>We have yet to find any other varnish recipe that calls for
                    oil of mastic. By contrast, solid mastic, in the form of
                    “tears,” is very common in varnish recipes. Though the
                    author-practitioner may have had in mind a volatile oil
                    distilled from mastic, we have decided to proceed under the
