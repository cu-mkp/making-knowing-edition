        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <div>
            <p>Ms. Fr. 640 contains several entries for producing casts through
                a process of molding and casting in successive molds. One of
                these is “Cast of wax to represent an animal that one has not
                got” (fols. <a
                   href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/139v/f/139v/tl"><u>139v</u></a>–<a
                   href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/140v/f/140v/tl"><u>140v</u></a>).
                This entry presupposes that the practitioner has already
                lifecast a natural snake in a straight shape in a plaster mold.
                This plaster mold is poured with a special black wax which can
                be bent into the shape of an undulating snake. This black wax
                snake then forms the model for a “sand” mold (plaster and
                refractory materials), in which metal is cast. On the basis of
                this and other related entries, this essay recounts a
                reconstruction of the plaster molding and wax bending processes,
                and compares the resulting cast to an extant sixteenth-century
                cast bronze snake that is a combination of lifecasting and
                “repair,” or modeling.</p>

    <h2 id="molding-snakes-in-all-weather">Molding Snakes in All Weather</h2>
    <p>The author-practitioner of Ms. Fr. 640 includes numerous instructions for
        creating lifelike casts of a variety of animals by means of the process
        of lifecasting.<a href="#fn1"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref1"

        he makes the observation that snakes hide in the winter and thus are not
        available at all times to the founder who wishes to cast them. He lists
        three methods for overcoming this problem: keeping the snakes in
        barrels, making several molds with one snake in the summer, or, in a
        technique that does not, strictly speaking, seem to be related to
        seasonality, making a lifecast of a snake that one then subsequently
        casts in wax, twists into a lifelike shape, and then casts in metal:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Molding snakes in all weather</p>
        <p><em>
                <del>aulcu</del>
            </em> Because in the winter they hide in the earth, some feed them
            <em>
                <del>des</del>
            </em> in quantity in barrels filled with earth &amp; covered with
            manure. Others make several molds in summer, because with one snake,
            you can make four or five. And others mold lengthwise a natural
            snake, without it being curled, with common plaster, <sup>reheated
                as said</sup> <em>
                <del>pu</del>
            </em>, <em>en noyau</em> &amp; in two half molds, as said, then they
            cast it in wax. In that way they have snakes that they can twist as
            they like, and then they cast them in metal, as is said.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>In the margin, he notes “If, in twisting
        the snake from wax, some feature becomes undone, you can repair it by
        removing the protrusions from the molded wax.”</p>
    <h2 id="lifecasting-a-snake">Lifecasting a Snake</h2>
    <p>In this entry, the author-practitioner makes clear that snakes can be
        lifecast from “a natural snake” and he gives instructions for
        lifecasting various animals from start to finish in a very detailed yet
        non-sequential series of entries spanning fols. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/111r/f/111r/tl"><u>111r</u></a>–<a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/116r/f/116r/tl"><u>116r</u></a>.
        His instructions include catching (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/111v/f/111v/tl"><u>111v</u></a>),
        keeping, and killing them to avoid injuries (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/112r/f/112r/tl"><u>112r</u></a>),
        then posing them (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/111v/f/111v/tl"><u>111v</u></a>)
        on a clay base (fol. 111r), to create two-piece molds (fols. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/113r/f/113r/tl"><u>113r</u></a>–<a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/115r/f/115r/tl"><u>115r</u></a>)
        made from what the author-practitioner calls <em>sable</em> (“sand”),
        with plaster, pulverized brick, and feather alum (fol. 111v). The animal
        is burned out, and the mold is opened and cleaned of ash and any
        remaining bones. The mold is then closed and clamped together tightly,
        and, finally, it is poured with metal (115r–116r).</p>
    <p> This entry includes references to and illustrations for arranging
        natural snakes on the clay base (fol. 113r) and molding them in a curled
        shape (fol. 115r) (<i><u>Fig. 1</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 2</u></i>).
        Apparently, the author-practitioner determined that it is difficult to
        burn out a snake in a mold (as would be normal for other molded
        animals), and he provides two alternative methods. One is to open the
        mold and cut out all parts of the molded snake that are accessible, and
        then “reheat the mold so well that what remained inside burns, then pass
        some quicksilver inside, &amp; attracting <em>
            <del>ce qui</del>
        </em> the ashes &amp; the burnt bones from the inside, it will also come
        out, because the conduit is big, &amp; thus will not sour at all your
        material.” The other can be done when the plaster of the mold has set
        and the snake is still pliable within it: “You can pull really strongly
        the molded snake, because it is soft &amp; malleable &amp; obedient,
        &amp; the mold, having set, is so firm that, because of this, the
        imprint will not be spoiled” (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/115r/f/115r/tl"><u>115r</u></a>).

    </h2>
    <p>After the detailed instructions for lifecasting animals on the foregoing
        five folios, the author-practitioner recounts on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/116r/f/116r/tl"><u>116r</u></a>,
        as noted, that</p>

    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>This then is a hybrid method<a href="#fn2"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref2"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> of making a pure plaster (rather
        than “sand”) mold for a lifecast snake, but without the complications of
        posing and burning out (because it is cast lengthwise with no twists),
        then using that straight-snake two-piece plaster mold to cast a wax
        snake, which one then twists as desired, and, finally, in its new
        twisted shape, uses as a pattern for a two-piece sand mold, into which,
        after the wax is melted out, metal is cast. The result is a lifelike
        snake curved into its characteristic serpentine shape. We know of extant
        bronzes apparently made by bending soft wax, such as a sixteenth-century
        cast of a snake, curved into a characteristic undulatory shape, in the
        Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna (<i><u>Fig. 3</u></i>) (more on this
        below). This bronze snake further possesses the two hemipenes (male
        sexual organs) of the animal, which would seem to provide a naturalistic
        feature, however they appear to be added after the lifecast stage, and
        possibly modeled from wax rather than cast from life (<i><u>Fig. 4</u></i>). Remarkably, the author-practitioner mentions this organ in an
        entry on molding vipers, noting that “the male ejects from its nature
        [i.e., its genitals], which is at the bottom, when it is firmly pressed,
        a little mass like half an arquebus ball made in the genitals and full
        of very venomous spurs” (fol. <a

    <p>This hybrid technique, recounted by the author-practitioner as useful to
        more easily create a snake with a serpentine curve, and apparently
        employed in the making of Vienna snake, suggests a kind of duplicitous
        use of modeling in the lifecasting process. This essay explores this
        technique, attempts a reconstruction, and poses a hypothesis about the
        making of the Vienna snake in light of several entries in Ms. Fr. 640.
    </p>
    <h2 id="an-animal-one-has-not-got">An Animal One Has Not Got</h2>
    <p>In a long entry for “Cast of wax to represent an animal that one has not
        got” (fols. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/139v/f/139v/tl"><u>139v</u></a>–<a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/140v/f/140v/tl"><u>140v</u></a>)
        the author-practitioner recounts a method for casting and twisting a wax
        snake. This method involves making a special “black wax” from a mixture
        of wax, charcoal, and sulfur. He notes in the margin that this type of
        wax is generally employed for objects that cannot be released from a
        two-piece mold (such as “those which have arms &amp; legs out front or
        entwined”) and thus must be melted out (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/139v/f/139v/tl"><u>139v</u></a>).
        The author-practitioner sees this wax as especially useful because “This
        wax is very soft &amp; amiable &amp; pliant as copper, and it is so
        strong because of the sulfur, which renders it meltable much before the
        other,”<a href="#fn4"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref4"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> even asserting that “you can
        prove it on a hot slate” (fol. 140r).</p>
    <p>After giving very specific instructions for making the black wax,<a
           href="#fn5"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref5"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> he then discusses how to cast
        this wax into a two-piece “mold which is of white plaster” (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/140r/f/140r/tl"><u>140r</u></a>),
        cautioning that</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>before you use it, soak it for a good hour in cold water &amp; for at
            least as long in water <sup>so</sup> hot, that, at the beginning,
            you cannot hold your finger in it. And <em>
                <del>q</del>
            </em> take heed that it does <sup>not</sup> imbibe <em>
                <del>b</del>
            </em> more,<del>thus</del> but rather that it shows itself to be
            very wet everywhere, without the water being imbibed in it.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>He notes that “it is good to soak it one
        night or one day before casting in it, in order that it be well imbibed.
        The same must be done for fruits of sugar.”<a href="#fn6"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref6"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
    <p>Then, one removes the mold from the hot water (the two halves of which
        have already been bound together), and the wax, which must be at just
        the right temperature, is cast into it (fols. 139v–140r):</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>take heed if your wax has passed its high heat, which you will
            recognize when it no longer smokes, when it makes large tracts <em>
                <del><sup>se</sup></del>
            </em> <em>
                <del>re</del>
            </em> pulling at the edges, &amp; motionless &amp; close <del>to
            </del> one to the other. For, if you were to cast too hot, you could
            not separate your wax from the mold, &amp; it would set in the cast.
            When it is in this good state, stir it with a little stick, in order
            that <sup>the</sup> pulverized charcoal is everywhere &amp; not
            placed at the bottom. And in this way, cast in your mold, little by
            little, &amp; not in one go, because the wax, by its unctuousness,
            does not flow like other things, &amp; on this occasion, you can
            cast two or three times until your mold is full.”</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>The mold should be “cool before opening
        it, in order that the cast thing does not break. You will recognize that
        the cast is good when the wax tipped out of the mold is thin and smooth.
        Remember to make many gates all along the mold, in order that the wax
        may thus run better.” (More below on this method of tipping out the wax
        from the mold.)</p>
    <p>Once the wax is cooled and removed carefully from the mold, it can be
        shaped and modeled. In the margin at the start of the entry, the
        author-practitioner had alluded to this process: “To make snakes with
        wax, or another thing to fix on a candle, one needs to cast with
        modeling wax of all colors” (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/139r/f/139r/tl"><u>139r</u></a>).
        The long set of instructions for making the black wax and casting it
        into a mold clearly forms the main interest and focus of the
        author-practitioner, and he appears to be especially taken with the
        potential of this particular technique for multiple reproductions,
        writing, “And the more you will cast, the neater you will make it, and
        your mold will serve you for more than a hundred times if it is well
        managed.” In what seems almost an afterthought, he briefly mentions in
        the margin the technique for actually making use of the cast wax animal
        that is produced by this process: “When your animal is cast [...]. if
        you want to refold it &amp; twist it around on some stick or taper, put
        it to soften <del>on</del> in hot water, and hold it while twisting it

    <p>Vasari describes the use of a “black wax” for “roughing out,” or
        “modeling,” a first version of a sculpture.<a href="#fn7"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref7"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> This step of the sculpting
        process involves adding or removing material to create a first shape,
        whereas lifecasting consists in taking an imprint of a pre-existing
        form, thus the entries in Ms. Fr. 640 for hybrid lifecast-modeled forms
        perhaps represent an adapted or lesser-known use of black wax. Another
        entry in Ms. Fr. 640, however, points to an important conception of the
        relationship between repairing and roughing out: having molded the
        different parts of a bird separately, one can “repair them to first
        model a form” (<em>&amp; reparent pour esbaucher premierement une
            forme</em>) (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/157v/f/157v/tl"><u>157v</u></a>).
        This apparent equivalence between <em>reparer</em> (“repair”) and
        <em>esbaucher</em> (“modeling” or “roughing out”) is significant for
        understanding the author-practitioner’s aims in his art of casting.
        <em>Reparer</em>, from the Latin <em>reparare</em>, means restoring the
        molded object to a state resembling the original. More generally,
        repairing is conceived today as adding material when a molded object has
        holes caused by air bubbles inside the mold, or in removing excess
        material, such as the flashing formed by molded material leaking into
        the joints of the mold. Ideally, those adjustments should not be visible
        to the viewer. “Repair” thus today consists in adding finishing touches
        to reproduce the details of the template, as, for example, by chasing.
    </p>
    <p>For the author-practitioner, however, repair and modeling mean something
        different. He speaks again of modeling <em>and</em> repairing on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/125v/f/125v/tl"><u>125v</u></a>,
        in an entry for “Plaster for casting of wax” describing a method for
        casting a snake in wax: “to model an animal closest to nature, to repair
        it afterward” (<em>Mays cest pour esbaucher animal au plus pres du
            naturel Et pour apres le reparer</em>). This appears to be modeling
        (<em>esbaucher</em>) an animal by molding, with an intermediate
        retouching of the wax before subsequently casting it in metal.<a
           href="#fn8"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref8"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> In the later seventeenth century,
        Félibien mentioned this double use of “repair,” whereby the sculptor can
        still interpret the wax before the metal is cast.<a href="#fn9"

           id="fnref9"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
    <p>The equivalence that the author-practitioner sees between “modeling” and
        “repairing” is closely connected to his primary concern of creating
        lifelike cast objects in molds that can be used multiple times. With his
        deep interest and apparent expertise in lifecasting, the
        author-practitioner may have preferred to make an entirely lifecast
        snake to preserve the natural detail of scales, but, as he noted on fol.
        <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/115r/f/115r/tl"><u>115r</u></a>,
        the twisted serpentine shape of the snake made that difficult, thus he
        provides a hybrid method on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/116v/f/116v/tl"><u>116v</u></a>
        in his entry about “molding snakes in all weather.” If lifecasting
        relies on the perfection of molding to produce the illusion of life
        (once the object is painted), the modeling, or “repair” achieves a
        naturalistic appearance by manipulating the imprint’s faithfulness to
        its original (natural) pattern.</p>
    <p>An artisan making a livelihood by lifecasting would be concerned to mold
        snakes in all weather, and thus would find techniques that preserved
        molds and saved time and fuel of great utility.<a href="#fn10"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref10"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> There is no evidence that the
        reproductive technology of lifecasting was regarded in the sixteenth
        century as a lesser or “mechanical” form of the art of casting. And,
        rather than striving to display his hand and ingenuity as an original
        modeler, the sculptor casting from life strove instead to display his
        virtuosity in <em>hiding</em> the work of his hand.<a href="#fn11"

    <p>My hypothesis is that the repairing of the snake mentioned on fol. 125v
        and displayed by the Vienna bronze relies on the author-practitioner’s
        dual use of repair in a technical and interpretive sense, that is, to
        respond to the technical challenge of molding the serpentine curve of
        the snake and to display his talent by hiding his hand. To explore the
        intermediate wax modeling stage through reconstruction, I first piece
        together the instructions from relevant entries in Ms. Fr. 640. I then
        describe my experiments with black wax molding and modeling, and
        formulate hypotheses about the bronze snake from Vienna. We cannot aim
        to be exhaustive, or to solve the puzzle of the making of the Vienna
        bronze. Our aim, rather, is to study the case of a collusion between
        modeling and molding in the case of the snake.</p>
    <h2 id="the-process">The Process</h2>
    <p>For the reconstruction, I followed “Cast of wax to represent an animal
        that one has not got” on fols. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/139v/f/139v/tl"><u>139v</u></a>–<a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/140v/f/140v/tl"><u>140v</u></a>,
        but sought out further details from other entries on casting, on metals,
        and on the methods of coloring a cast animal.</p>
    <p>In reading this entry more closely in order to reconstruct it, I realized
        that the sketch showing the plaster mold (that had been created from a
        natural snake) for the wax snake was not straight, but already curved
        into a serpentine shape (<i><u>Fig. 5</u></i>). But, these
        instructions were for making a straight snake that one could “refold it
        &amp; twist it around on some stick or taper” by softening it in hot
        water (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/140r/f/140r/tl"><u>140r</u></a>).
        Why is the snake to be cast in black wax shown in this sketch as curved?
        The answer may lie in a detail of the instructions on fol. 140r, where
        the author-practitioner notes that “you will recognize that the cast is
        good when the wax tipped out of the mold is thin and smooth.” This
        technical detail seems to indicate that he pours out some of the wax
        from the mold to obtain a thin-walled hollow wax cast (known as slush
        molding), which could perhaps be used for the molding of a core for a
        snake that would be cast hollow in metal, as is mentioned on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/107v/f/107v/tl"><u>107v</u></a>:
        “When you want to mold hollow, it is necessary that the core be of the
        same material. And if the snake or the animal is curved or folded, one
        ought to make the core of several pieces.”</p>

    </div>
    <p>The entry on 139v–140v does not include the aim of making a hollow wax
        cast. Indeed, as is frequent in Ms. Fr. 640, the author-practitioner
        does not describe further steps in a process by which a finished object
        is produced. Instead, one must search the manuscript to glean any hint
        of subsequent stages. In the entry for “molding an animal that one has
        not got,” he does not lay out the steps by which the black wax snake
        itself is molded, simply noting that “When your animal is cast, cut with
        a hot penknife the flashing &amp; superfluous things. And if you want to
        refold it &amp; twist it around on some stick or taper, put it to soften
        <del>on</del> in hot water, and hold it while twisting it around” (fol.
        140r).</p>
    <p>The steps following this process of producing a wax snake in a two-piece
        plaster mold (made from the natural snake) would be to mold the wax
        snake in a two-piece mold made of sand (<em>sable</em>, i.e., plaster
        and refractory material) as is done with lifecasting natural snakes. The
        wax melts out during the firing of the mold, and metal is cast into the
        resulting cavity. Any metal flashing is then removed with various tools
        such as files and chisels. Lost detail, of the scales, for example, can
        be repaired using punches, or a burin, as noted on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/152v/f/152v/tl"><u>152v</u></a>
        in “Repairing cast things.” Holes or flashing can also be filled with
        black, grey, or white wax made with ceruse. Finally, paint helps to hide
        any repairs, while completing the illusion of a live animal with its
        natural colors.<a href="#fn12"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref12"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> Thus, we can view the addition
        of paint as the final step in “repairing” the cast—in the sense of
        making it resemble the original natural animal.<a href="#fn13"

    <h2 id="reconstruction">Reconstruction</h2>
    <p>My goal in the reconstruction was only to experiment with the hollow and
        solid casting of black wax and to attempt to bend the resulting casts in
        the curves of the Vienna snake.<a href="#fn14"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref14"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> This was of particular interest
        because the bending of the hollow wax snake seemed quite implausible. My
        goals were limited, and my results can only be regarded as preliminary.
    </p>
    <p>For the reconstruction, I began by creating the plaster mold. I used an
        artificial rubber snake as a model because I did not have access to a
        dead natural snake. Since then, I have been able to recreate the mold
        using a natural snake (see <a
           href="https://insculpture.hypotheses.org/1183"><u>https://insculpture.hypotheses.org/1183</u></a>).
    </p>
    <p>I followed the instructions on fols. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/139v/f/139v/tl"><u>139v</u></a>–<a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/140v/f/140v/tl"><u>140v</u></a>,
        and drew details from two other entries treating plaster molds for
        casting wax, on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/125v/f/125v/tl"><u>125v</u></a>,
        “Plaster for casting of wax,” and, on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/127r/f/127r/tl"><u>127r</u></a>,
        “Molds of plaster for wax.” The latter includes a sketch of a curved
        snake with casting channels (<i><u>Fig. 6</u></i>), which represents a
        mold, made from a curved lifecast snake, into which wax is to be cast.
        In the author-practitioner’s instructions, half the weight of pestled
        charcoal is added to a given weight of wax,<a href="#fn15"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref15"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> as well as a walnut-sized amount
        of sulfur. I made a first mold with a capacity of 150g of wax which had
        the form of a straight snake, as described on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/116v/f/116v/tl"><u>116v</u></a>.
        I made this plaster mold in three parts to facilitate the extraction of
        the wax, following the example of the Vienna snake (although the entry
        on fol. 116v refers to a two-piece mold). I used oil as a release agent
        to make the wax cast easier to remove from the mold. For 150g of wax, I
        added 75g of vine charcoal and 18g of sulfur. The author-practitioner
        says that the sulfur causes the wax to be “very soft &amp; amiable &amp;
        pliant as copper, and it is so strong because of the sulfur, which
        renders it meltable much before the other.” I did not experiment with
        other wax mixtures, and thus could not test the function of sulfur in
        the process,<a href="#fn16"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref16"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> which may also be related to
        sulfur’s association with experimentation and transformation in the
        author-practitioner’s material imaginary.<a href="#fn17"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref17"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> The snake, made from this
        two-to-one mixture of wax and charcoal, was extremely hard to bend when
        the wax had cooled (<i><u>Vid. 1</u></i>). This stiffness must be useful
        during the subsequent sand molding because the shape remains stable when
        the snake is handled. I tried to submerge the wax snake in hot water to
        soften it, as noted on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/140r/f/140r/tl"><u>140r</u></a>,
        but this technique is difficult to implement without melting the details
        of the snake’s scales.</p>

    <p>The difficulties of bending the hollow snake vanished when I made a

        because the curves only needed to be bent a small distance (<i><u>Vid.
                4</u></i>). In this case, it is better to follow the advice on
        fol. 140r and remove the wax when it has cooled, without, however,
        waiting until it is completely cold. It is difficult to quantify how to
        achieve this intermediate state,<a href="#fn18"

        The folds of the snake, as it turns out, cover the holes left by the
        vents of the casting infrastructure, thus reducing the necessary repair.
        One of the advantages of the black color is that it facilitates the
        retouching work because the details appear clearly (fol. <a

                by pouring the mold with the wax and tipping it out repeatedly,
                as suggested by the statement, “you will recognize that the cast
                is good when the wax tipped out of the mold is thin and smooth”
                on fol. 140r. Bending this snake into a shape emulating that of
                the Vienna snake was easier than bending a straight snake cast,
                and it also hid the marks of the casting channels. © Making and

    <p>It is possible, then, to bend a hollow or a solid wax cast by using quite
        warm or lukewarm wax. Future experiments might vary the amount of sulfur
        to determine its role. The sketch showing a snake already twisted could
        be a case of “roughing out” in the sense that the molded shape contains
        the beginnings of the serpentine form that the repair completes by
        folding the hollow wax snake.</p>
    <h2 id="hypothesis-about-the-vienna-snake">Hypothesis about the Vienna Snake
    </h2>
    <p>The Vienna snake encompasses two different intentions at the same time.
        The craftsman represents both the forward motion of the snake and the
        anatomy of its genitals. While we cannot know for sure whether the
        caster really molded the genitals, those two divergent intentions seem
        to be the result of a plan that did not include the hemipenes from the
        start.</p>
    <p> Flashing (metal that leaked out between the mold halves during casting)
        has been filed off along the casting seams leaving burrs which indicate
        that the snake was likely molded in a plaster mold comprising three
        pieces (as I also did in my reconstructions, see the videos). This first
        (plaster) mold had one piece for the belly and two side pieces for the
        body. Making the mold in three pieces facilitated the removal of the wax
        snake. The seam of the mold piece on the animal’s back was hidden by
        shaping a groove in the wax all along the back of the snake (<i><u>Fig. 7</u></i>). On the underside of the snake, two seams are
        visible, left by the two-piece (sand) mold of the second molding (<i><u>Fig. 8</u></i>). These follow the outlines of the side casting
        seams from the first (plaster) mold. They are located along the juncture
        of the scales covering the upper part of the snake and the rings
        covering its belly. This judicious placement hides the seam within the
        natural pattern of the animal. In addition, the detail of the scales
        suggests that the wax snake was handled to bend the animal, since the
        scales appear clearly worn down through handling or by a heat source.
        The cast appears to be a solid casting, rather than a hollow one.<a

    </div>
    <p>The casting seams also pass along the hemipenes, which is odd because the
        craftsman would well have known how to hide those ungraceful traces
        within the animal’s anatomy (<i><u>Fig. 9</u></i>). From a technical
        point of view, this can be seen as a mistake, because these burrs
        distort the genitals. The flashing betrays two competing intentions,
        however, and raises the possibility that the plaster mold was first made
        to produce en masse snakes without hemipenes.<a href="#fn21"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref21"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a> Another detail supports this
        hypothesis. The snake’s rings are better preserved in the cast than the
        scales; however, the rings become indistinct on the second to last curve
        of the snake, where the genitals are located. It is possible that this
        part of the body of the snake was reinforced with wax to incorporate the
        molded hemipenes. Although it is difficult to know for certain, this
        addition could have been a way for the craftsman to overcome some
        technical difficulty. We cannot exclude the possibility that the
        craftsman fixed the hemipenes with metal pins driven into the body,
        however, in this case, any retouching would only be visible on the
        hemipenes themselves, leaving details of the rings untouched. Adding the
        genitals between the two moldings is an example of “repair” as modeling,
        or, in other words, making the wax cast resemble more closely its
        original lifecast model.</p>

    <p>Finally, the snake shows traces of green paint. It is impossible to judge
        today in what way the paint could have covered up imperfections
        resulting from the molding or helped to define the snake’s anatomy to
        achieve a better likeness, but it too is an example of “repair” that is
        intended to bring the snake closer to its original model.</p>
    <p>Based on the entries in Ms. Fr. 640 and in the light of this examination
        of the Vienna snake and my reconstructions, then, my hypothesis about
        the molding process for the Vienna snake is as follows:</p>

                    hollow wax snake (although the Vienna snake does not seem to
                    be a hollow cast).</p>

        <li>
            <blockquote>
                <p>The wax snake is bent into a curve and casting infrastructure
                    of wide wax channels is added (although the Vienna snake
                    does not show evidence of wax channels between the curves),
                    then the modeled hemipenes are added to the wax snake, and
                    an attempt is made to hide the casting seams left in the wax
                    snake by the three-piece mold (thus creating the groove that
                    shows on the back of the Vienna snake).</p>

        <li>
            <blockquote>
                <p>If the snake is to be cast hollow in metal, a core of plaster
                    would need to be poured into the hollow of the wax snake at
                    this point, and core pins attached (although the
                    author-practitioner says to make this core in several pieces

    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>This process may have been employed to
        create snakes for serial production, as both the plaster and sand molds
        could hypothetically be used multiple times. Recall that the
        author-practitioner was especially enthusiastic about this aspect: “your
        mold will serve you for more than a hundred times if it is well managed”
        (fol. 140r).</p>
    <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The case of the snake and the black wax shows that repairing is not only
        a finishing stage at the end of the molding process. It can also be a
        technical and interpretive technique in the interval between the plaster
        molding of the natural snake and the sand molding of the wax cast made
        from it.</p>
    <p>The author-practitioner chooses to create a lifecast of the snake by
        means of direct molding of the animal, in order to preserve all its
        natural detail. The use of the black wax not only allowed for hollow
        metal casts, but its qualities also could respond to the technical
        challenge of the complicated serpentine shape of the snake. It had to
        bend without breaking or cracking, even when hollow, while keeping the
        details of the animal intact. The addition of the sulfur to the black
        wax may be experimentation on the author-practitioner’s part to improve
        the flexibility of the wax. Such experiments aim to overcome the
        difficulty of burning and cleaning out a curved snake from a sand mold.
        Molding a snake in a curved shape in the plaster mold not only allows
        one to represent the animal “in all weather,” but also allows for
        further manipulation. The black wax affords a technical alternative to
        molding the complex contortions of the animal by manually altering the
        snake’s imprint. This is where the ambivalent status of “roughing out”
        comes into play to give a new character to lifecasting. My hypothesis is
        that the realization of the final shape is relegated to the “repairing”
        step of the process, which is both technical and interpretive: it
        facilitates a complicated molding project as well as the interpretive
        manipulation of the snake’s serpentine shape.</p>
    <p>The duplicity of the artifice is that it combines the authenticity of a
        direct imprint with interpretive manipulation of the snake into a
        naturalistic representation. The creative possibilities of the wax
        modeling “repairs” are illustrated by the example of the Vienna snake’s
        genitals. If we follow our hypothesis, the reinforcement of the snake’s
        body and the hemipenes are interventions at the level of wax modeling.
        For this reason, the Vienna snake can perhaps be understood in relation
        to Norberto Grammacini’s concept of “built mutations,”<a href="#fn23"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref23"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a> that is to say, as an object of
        curiosity made by the human hand.<a href="#fn24"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref24"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a> It is hard to judge to what
        extent this addition was a response to technical constraints and/or
        simply a creative opportunity. It seems clear, at least, that the
        hemipenes were not intended to be perceived as modeled by hand; nor
        should the snake’s serpentine shape appear artificial to the viewer. On
        the technical level, a repair, however minute, needs to integrate into
        the molding process. In this way, the hemipenes and the artificial
        curvature of the snake must appear as true as the surface of the snake
        as a whole. The stakes of the animal’s genitals or its undulatory shape,
        apart from its natural historical interest, are the virtuosic use of a
        modeling step that is integral to the molding process, and produces a
        lifelike result.</p>
    <p>The specific case of the Vienna snake can engage a contemporary viewer in
        a twofold interaction with lifecasting. We can assume that the act of
        picking up and turning the object over to look underneath already
        destroys the first surprise at seeing a lifelike snake apparently moving
        towards a viewer and perhaps preparing to strike. The next stage of
        apprehension is that this illusion of lifelikeness is created by a
        direct molding process. But, if a viewer noticed the hemipenes, would
        their modeled form be perceived? Or does this constitute a third level
        of artifice: a viewer thinks they have identified a lifecast before
        them, but it is actually the product of a hybrid technique? A technical
        understanding of this object might produce a lasting sense of wonder,
        like a distant echo of the feeling of astonishment at ingenious
        solutions known in the sixteenth century as <em>maraviglia</em>,<a

                <p>This passage on fol. 125v is not easy to understand: “One
                    needs to smooth well away all the scales, for wax would
                    enter there &amp; not release well. In molding thus the
                    [natural] animal, flatten down the scales for wax &amp;, on
                    the contrary, rub them in reverse in order that they stand
                    up for animals [i.e., for lifecasting natural animals], for
                    they will only be more visible.” This seems to suggest that
                    the natural snake is also manipulated when being molded in
                    plaster in preparation for making the wax cast (which is
                    then also modeled and “repaired”).<a href="#fnref8"

                    The conception of lifecasting as “mechanical” was not
                    current in the sixteenth century and seems to have been
                    applied retrospectively in the train of concerns about the

                <p>This double status of repairing seems already to be in use by
                    Cennino Cennini in the fifteenth century when he describes
                    the molding of the entire human body. He advises producing
                    an intermediary wax stage to manipulate the molding by
                    adding and withdrawing material. Cennino Cennini, <em>Le

                    casting can probably be extrapolated to all founders, and
                    seem also to be reflected in the sparse mention the

                    a way of taking advantage of the intermediary states of the
                    material. The use of the sun as heat source is an example of
