        <div>
            <p>“Against burns, excellent” (fol. <a

                gives detailed instructions on the making and application of a
                salve for burns. Like some other medical recipes in the
                manuscript it calls for relatively few ingredients but specifies
                a complex making process to transform the material into a
                different state. The recipe is unusual among the other medical
                recipes in Ms. Fr. 640, however, because it possesses explicit
                spiritual dimensions, including pure ingredients, holy water,
                and the recitation of prayers. In addition, the recipe provides
                information about its source and trustworthiness. The
                reconstruction of the recipe revealed the transformation of the
                mixture of linseed oil and hardening wax, two hydrophobic
                substances, into a fluffy white ointment through constant
                stirring with water, and, at the same time, the purifying
                “ritual” brought about a visible whitening and “inspiriting” of
                the materials with each recited prayer and washing with holy
                water.</p>

        “Against burns, excellent,” gives detailed instructions for the making
        and application of an “excellent” salve for burns:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>
            <strong>Against burns, excellent</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Heat linseed oil on a gentle fire without letting it boil &amp;
            simmer, but once it is hot, put in a quarter as much of the newest
            wax you can. Once melted, let it cool, &amp; once they begin to
            curdle, stir continuously with a new wooden spatula <em>
                <del>t</del>
            </em> for as long as it takes you to say <del>one</del> 9
            paternoster, and as you say them, wash this composition with holy
            water, stirring all the while. Having said the first <sup>9</sup>
            paternoster, pour out the first water &amp; put in new one, &amp;
            wash &amp; stir the composition for the time it takes you to say 8
            paternoster, and the 3rd time for as long as 7, &amp; thus you will
            consecutively <del>until</del> add new water, doing the same as
            above, until the last &amp; single paternoster of nine. Then you
            shall have a soft &amp; white ointment, with which you shall anoint
            the burn for the space of 9 days. But do not apply it any longer
            than this, for it would cause <em>
                <del>a</del>
            </em> your flesh to grow excessively. You <del>b</del> shall bandage
            yourself twice a day, &amp; each time you shall wash your face with
            water &amp; wine mixed together, a little tepid, not rubbing, but as
            if pressing with a wet linen cloth, and you shall wipe it similarly
            <em>
                <del>aff</del>
            </em> with a fine linen cloth, &amp; next put the ointment, over
            which you can put ivy leaves. This causes hair to regrow &amp;
            leaves no scar. A gunpowder maker who had almost completely burnt
            himself <em>
                <del>m’a</del>
            </em> &amp; showed no sign of the burn, taught me this.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>It calls for relatively few ingredients,
        but the creation process is rather complex. The recipe is exceptional
        among the manuscript’s other medical recipes because it possesses
        explicit religious components, including holy water and prayers. My
        reconstruction of the recipe focuses on the process of making the salve.
        I chose not to test its efficacy because possible hazards are not clear.

    <h2 id="what-is-a-salve-ingredients-making-processes-and-application">What
        is a Salve: Ingredients, Making Processes, and Application</h2>
    <p>Salves and ointments, usually oil-based, were widely employed medical
        preparations in early modern Europe for treating external injuries, such
        as wounds and burns, for external lesions such as ulcers or syphilitic
        sores, and in relieving swellings, sore muscles and joint pain. It is
        unclear what exactly was meant by the terms “salve” or “ointment” in
        early modern Europe, but these terms commonly appear in books of
        secrets, household recipe collections and cookbooks. Salves and
        ointments appear to have been related to “balsams;” however, the
        differentiation of these terms would require close comparison of
        different recipes and reconstruction of the substances, which is beyond
        the scope of this essay. Here, I specifically focus on a single salve,
        investigating its ingredients and reconstructing the recipe.</p>
    <p>The recipe calls for two basic ingredients: linseed oil and wax. They
        were two of the most common materials used in early modern Europe for
        cooking, lighting, and various artisanal works. Linseed oil, however,
        was not a material with a well-known therapeutic value. Instead, it was
        widely used in the artisanal practices of oil painting and varnish
        making. Indeed, linseed oil is one of the most frequently appearing oils
        in Ms. Fr. 640, and an entry on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/52v/f/52v/tl"><u>52v</u></a>
        about picking the seed (presumably for pressing the oil), advises
        picking the seeds before they are perfectly ripe. The multiple uses of
        materials by the author-practitioner is a noticeable feature of the
        manuscript, and in the case of medical recipes, as I argue in another
        essay, a wide range of artisanal materials are used as medicinal
        substances, and vice versa.<a href="#fn1"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref1"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
    <p>Wax was also a versatile material, its malleable and plastic properties
        making it useful for a variety of artisanal work. There are 110 recipes
        in Ms. Fr. 640 that require wax as a molding material, casting aid,
        adhesive, sealant or medicine, or that mention it as a denotation of a
        specific consistency.<a href="#fn2"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref2"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> The protean nature of wax was
        also valued as a material in imitative processes, as “it could readily
        change from one state to another, from solid to liquid, evoke the trope
        of transformation and mimic the material properties of metals that could
        be melted down and reconstituted into new objects.”<a href="#fn3"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref3"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
    <p>Wax was a popular medicinal ingredient between the fifteenth and
        seventeenth centuries, and it was “employed in a myriad of syrups and
        juleps, electuaries and pills, oils and ointments, plasters and
        poultices, laxatives and eyewashes.”<a href="#fn4"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref4"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> Its healing properties were
        thought to derive partly from its connections to religious symbols: its
        purity and its flammability were compared to the light and “humanity of
        Christ,” while its malleability made it a symbol for work by the hands
        of the Creator.<a href="#fn5"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref5"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> Grades of wax were judged by
        purity, the best being “not very yellow” and “not too fatty.”<a
           href="#fn6"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref6"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> A process of purification
        produced pure white wax: first, a practitioner crushed and cleaned the
        wax in mortars, removing most of the large impurities. Then the wax was
        simmered in an earthenware pot with seawater, alum, and saltpetre. When
        the cooking was finished and the wax was left to settle and cool, the
        impurities rose to the top of the solidified wax and were easily
        removed. This cooking process was repeated several times to produce the
        purest wax, “as white as God’s own beard.”<a href="#fn7"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref7"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
    <p>This processed white wax was most likely not what the author-practitioner
        meant on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/103r/f/103r/tl"><u>103r</u></a>
        by the “newest” wax. This new wax presumably had not yet undergone any
        purifying process and still possessed its yellow color and fatty
        texture. New wax was used in medical recipes and bewitching ointments.<a
           href="#fn8"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref8"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> The process of making the burn
        salve that I undertook was similar to the purifying process, and,
        although it read like a religious ritual, it turned out to be not just a
        ritual, but rather a “materialization of devotional process,” brought
        into being through the changing state of the materials.</p>
    <p>Holy water and prayers were believed to have healing power for a wide
        range of diseases in the early modern period. Like wax candles, breads,
        and other material objects that played a role in devotional practices
        (known as sacramentals), holy water could connect the temporal material
        world to the eternal realm of spirit. In Catholic territories, holy
        water was a cure all for sickness and an exorcising material that could
        drive away evil spirits.<a href="#fn9"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref9"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
    <p>The mixing of the ingredients was timed, as was common in craft
        procedures, by reciting the paternoster. The paternoster was one of the
        best known prayers in Christianity. Its brevity made it relatively easy
        to memorize, and it was used in artisanal recipes as a time-keeping
        device:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Pater Noster, qui es in caelis,</p>
        <p>sanctificetur nomen tuum;</p>
        <p>adveniat regnum tuum;</p>
        <p>fiat voluntas tua,</p>
        <p>sicut in caelo, et in terra.</p>
        <p>Panem nostrum supersubstantialem da nobis hodie;</p>
        <p>et dimitte nobis debita nostra,</p>
        <p>sicut et nos dimittimus debitoribus nostris;</p>
        <p>et ne nos inducas in tentationem;</p>
        <p>Sed libera nos a malo.</p>
        <p>Amen</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>Making the burn salve requires nine full
        cycles of mixing holy water with the salve. The length of each cycle is
        gradually decreased by one paternoster, starting at nine paternoster in
        the first cycle to one in the last. Nine was seen as a significant,
        sometimes magical, number, connected to the Trinity, and conveying
        perfection.</p>
    <p>Through this process, linseed oil and wax, both of a yellow color, were
        supposed to be transformed into a soft white ointment, which, according
        to the recipe, should be applied on the burn twice a day for nine days,
        no less and no more. Each time, one should wash one’s face with tepid
        water and wine by pressing with a moistened linen cloth and using the
        cloth to soothe the burns. After applying the salve, the recipe
        recommends applying ivy leaves to facilitate hair growth and avoid
        leaving a scar. Ivy was regarded as having “hairy” stems, thus its
        mention brings the human body and plants into homologous relation in
        this recipe. Perhaps this is the origin of the vernacular notion that
        ivy leaves have healing power, common in English medical traditions.<a
           href="#fn10"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref10"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> Ivy could also symbolize eternal
        life, as it remained green through the winter.</p>
    <p>Oil and wax were common ingredients in making salves in the early modern
        period. Additional materials like herbs, metals, and minerals could be
        added to enhance the healing power. The royal apothecary and chemist
        Nicolas Lemery (1645–1715) devoted a chapter to recipes for making
        salves and ointments. In most of these recipes, oil and wax are listed
        as ingredients. Wax is sometimes replaced by other similar substances
        possessing both viscous and solid states and a low melting point, such
        as turpentine or butter.<a href="#fn11"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref11"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
    <p>No sense of the appearance of the salve on fol. 103r can be derived
        through reading or textual research of this recipe. Only reconstruction
        can reveal the final appearance of the “excellent” burn salve. As
        described below, this reconstruction reveals a surprising process of
        material transformation and spiritual materialization.</p>
    <h2 id="reconstruction">Reconstruction</h2>
    <p>For the reconstruction, I used cold pressed linseed oil and yellow
        beeswax.<a href="#fn12"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref12"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> Cold pressed linseed oil
        contains many impurities that make it appear a darker yellow than the
        refined oil used for painting. Linseed oil in the early modern period
        was a cheaper alternative used by the poor, and I assume the linseed oil
        used by author-practitioner was unrefined. The wax, too, was “new,” and
        thus probably unrefined.</p>
    <p>According to the recipe, the wax should be one quarter of the amount of
        linseed oil. I decided to measure by volume rather than weight, and I
        used 100 ml linseed oil and 25 ml solid beeswax in the experiment. I
        made the decision to use tap water instead of holy water, as “holiness”
        comes from the blessing of a priest, with no additional components. The
        recitation of the paternoster was essential, however, for it is not only
        a purifying prayer, but also a way to measure time. In total, the
        paternoster must be recited forty-five times during the process. I chose
        the Latin version of the prayer, as that would have been used by a
        literate Catholic in late sixteenth-century France. There are two ways
        of reciting the paternoster: singing or speaking. As I measured it,
        singing doubles the time of speaking. I could not determine whether the
        paternoster was sung or spoken at the time, therefore I arbitrarily made
        the decision to speak it. Furthermore, the paternoster needed to be
        recited by a person, rather than simply timed because the speed of the
        spoken prayer varies, and it is important to capture this feature of
        time measurement in early modern artisanal work—it was not rigorously
        precise, but flexible and attuned to the degree of heat and the evolving
        appearance of the materials.</p>
    <p>The linseed oil was to be simmered on a light fire without boiling. The
        flash point of linseed oil is 222℃ and the boiling point 340℃. The oil
        is not to be heated to those temperatures. The proper temperature should
        be a little higher than the melting point of beeswax, which ranges from
        62 to 65°C. In order to facilitate the full melting of the beeswax, I
        decided to heat to 85°C.</p>
    <p>After melting the beeswax in the hot linseed oil, I removed the pot from
        the hotplate and let it cool. About ten minutes later, the mixture
        started to “curdle,” as called for in the recipe (<i><u>Fig. 1</u></i>).
        I then added water. Ludovic Touzé Peiffer helped by reciting the
        paternoster while I stirred the oil, wax, and water mixture constantly
        with a new wooden chopstick (as the recipe also called for a new wooden
        spatula).</p>

    <p>The material transformation began in the first cycle. The substance in
        the pot started to increase in volume, as if water and air was being
        stirred into its structure. The dark yellow, viscous, oily substance
        gradually became whiter and creamier. The volume of the oil and wax
        mixture was one fifth of the pot at first; after the first cycle of
        washing (nine paternosters), the volume increased to one third (<i><u>Fig. 2</u></i>). The water I poured off from the mixture between
        washing cycles was much less than the amount I had added (<i><u>Fig. 3</u></i>). As I continued the process of adding water and
        stirring, the volume of the substance continued to expand, and the color
        became whiter and whiter. After the nine cycles of “washing,” we got a
        full pot of very light and fluffy, almost white, smooth, creamy,
        lotion-like salve with a strong smell of linseed oil (<i><u>Fig. 4</u></i>). The structure of the salve, however, turned out to be unstable.
        Water continued to be released from it, and, after a week, the salve
        shrank back to almost the original volume of oil and wax.</p>

    <h2 id="medical-credibility">Medical Credibility</h2>
    <p>The author-practitioner claimed he learned the recipe from a
        <em>Pouldrier</em>, a gunpowder maker. Gunpowder making was dangerous
        work in the early modern period, and this gunpowder maker claimed to
        have sustained disfiguring burns. The author-practitioner noted in the
        recipe that he observed not a trace of these burns. A knowledge-sharing
        network involved multiple ways of verifying the credibility of a recipe,
        of which firsthand experience or observation was one. The efficacy of
        the recipe was proven by a claim of firsthand experience: I tried it and
        it worked. This is common in Ms. Fr. 640, as well as many other texts of
        practice at this time. The “secrets” shared among craft practitioners
        and within the medical marketplace largely relied upon the experience
        and credibility of individuals.</p>
    <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>This recipe might be unremarkable were it not for its devotional aspects.
        The surprising aspect of reconstructing this recipe (in contrast to
        simply reading it) was that the process of mixing holy water while
        repeating paternosters caused a tangible “purification” and
        “inspiriting” of the raw materials, as the mixture became white and
        fluffier. The transformation in state of the materials in this recipe
        caused a devotional practice to emerge before one’s eyes in a
        materialized form. In modern chemical terms, this is of course an
        emulsion, a mixture of two or more normally immiscible liquids, and it
        is a commonly employed process in pharmaceutical practice to make
        creams, lotions, ointments, and pastes. In this recipe, however, it is
        an example of the kind of material transformation common to many recipes
        in Ms. Fr. 640, which, at the same time, brought into being a
        materialization of spiritual devotion. Our reconstruction was of course
        inauthentic: we could not capture the spiritual significance of the
        process—I did not even use holy water—but, even so, the material
        transformation converged with and made tangible the spiritual process.
        Perhaps that was the secret that cured the gunpowder maker’s burns.</p>
