        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <div>
            <p>This essay explores the meaning of <em>esmail</em> in Ms. Fr. 640
                and places it in the context of historical enameling techniques.
                The term translates as “enamel,” but whereas this usually
                implies a vitreous substance produced using heat, in Ms. Fr. 640
                it also encompasses materials with a glossy, enamel-like
                appearance without the application of heat, such as “cold
                enamels” which can be painted out, and in fact surpass vitreous
                enamels in their versatility and ease of application.</p>

    <p>There are thirty-six entries in Ms. Fr. 640 that mention <em>esmail</em>,
        a term which is frequently translated as “enamel.” Today, the term
        “enamel” is generally used to mean a colored, vitreous material
        processed by heat to create a shiny, hard substance that decorates
        metal, glass, or ceramic surfaces.<a href="#fn1"

        different from the modern definition of “enamel.”</p>
    <p>The author-practitioner included recipes in Ms. Fr. 640 for making
        different colors of <em>esmail</em>, directions regarding which

    </p>
    <p>With such a wide variety of related usages, a single definition of
        <em>esmail</em> seems elusive. Nevertheless, the recipes in the
        manuscript that involve <em>esmail</em> may be grouped into three
        thematic clusters: painting on glass,<a href="#fn4"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref4"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> imitating precious stones, and
        painting on metal. This essay seeks to understand how the
        author-practitioner would have defined <em>esmail</em> by examining the
        commonalities among the diverse mentions of <em>esmail</em>, and
        exploring the applications of it within each of these three areas.
        Ultimately, the essay focuses on two areas of practice which Ms. Fr. 640
        illuminates: cold <em>esmail</em> (or, cold-painted enamels), and
        <em>esmail</em> that imitates or enhances gems.</p>
    <p>In researching and reconstructing the recipes for enamel in Ms. Fr. 640,
        we sought to better understand what the author-practitioner meant by
        <em>esmail</em> and whether the term was used to describe a visual
        effect, rather than a specific material, or a making process. The
        principal questions we explored were: What are the underlying qualities
        that the author-practitioner considers to be definitive of
        <em>esmail</em>? What are the desired optical qualities of
        <em>esmail</em>? How can these same qualities be created with a variety
        of techniques that all employ differing materials? Once we began
        investigating these questions, we discovered there was an opportunity to
        concentrate on the topic of cold <em>esmail,</em> a technique that
        emerges as an important one for the author-practitioner, but one which
        has been little-recognized in modern scholarship as a historical
        category of <em>esmail</em>. As such, we wanted to focus on
        understanding the primary applications of cold <em>esmail</em> recipes,
        and how common they were in the early modern period. Ultimately, we
        concluded that cold <em>esmail</em> recipes were intended to imitate the
        visual effect of vitreous enamels and precious gems, principally on
        metal and glass substrates, and that the use of cold <em>esmail</em> was
        not uncommon among early-modern practitioners—a fact that may prompt us
        to reconsider what was understood as “enamel” in early modern France.

    <h2 id="what-is-esmail">What is <em>Esmail</em>?</h2>
    <p>Of the thirty-six recipes that refer to <em>esmail</em> in Ms. Fr. 640,
        only seven mention heating enamel or a substance like it.<a href="#fn5"

           id="fnref5"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> Fourteen of the recipes for

        recipes, and turpentine in eight.<a href="#fn6"

        becomes clear that there is a discrepancy between the modern
        understanding of <em>esmail</em> as something vitreous and the
        author-practitioner’s understanding and use of <em>esmail</em>, which
        often consisted of grinding pigments and mixing them with binders at
        room temperature before applying the finished product to a metal or
        glass surface.<a href="#fn7"

    <p>Among the recipes in the manuscript that refer to enamels produced with
        heat are the recipes for lampwork (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/6v/f/6v/tl"><u>6v</u></a>),
        whitening cornaline (fols. <a

           role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> They are either predicated on
        having a vitreous substance already made which can be manipulated with

           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/40r/f/40r/tl"><u>40r</u></a>),
        or they are focused on using heat in combination with enamels in order
        to change or restore color (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/12v/f/12v/tl"><u>12v</u></a>–<a

           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/104r/f/104r/tl"><u>104r</u></a>).
        These recipes fall into a group that is more representative of the
        modern concept of enamels: the recipes on fol. 6r and fol. 40r seem to
        describe lampwork, and the recipes on fol. 12v–13r, fol. 101r, and fol.
        104 describe the use of heat-processing to make the colors appear like
        those of more valuable stones—a practice that has been documented since
        the time of Seneca and Pliny.<a href="#fn9"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref9"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
    <p>While the recipes for heated enamels are therefore familiar, the cold
        enamel recipes in Ms. Fr. 640 do not resemble the material or technical
        definitions of known categories of enamels. In modern scholarship,
        <em>esmail</em>—meaning a vitreous enamel that has been fused to a metal
        substrate through the application of heat—is most commonly divided into
        <em>champlevé</em>, <em>cloisonné</em>, <em>basse taille</em>,<a
           href="#fn10"
           class="footnote-ref"

        enamel”—is often discussed in relation to the application process used
        for vitreous enameling in sixteenth-century Limoges, in which different
        layers of pigment were applied to the metal surfaces with a brush before
        they underwent various stages of firing into a final form, on top of
        which additional painted details could be added (<i><u>Fig. 1</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 2</u></i>).<a href="#fn12"

    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>Evidence for the fact that the term
        “painted enamel” was associated with vitreous “hot enamels” in early
        modern France can be found in the official title of one of the most
        famous enamellers of Limoges, Léonard Limosin. In 1548 Limosin was
        promoted to the position of <em>peintre émailleur et valet de chambre du
            roi</em>, and the combination of the title and his work demonstrate
        the association between hot enameling and the terminology of “painting”
        in sixteenth century France.<a href="#fn13"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref13"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> The author-practitioner
        apparently refers to this type of enamel when he notes in an entry on
        fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/37v/f/37v/tl"><u>37v</u></a>
        entitled “Glassworker,” that</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Those who discovered the invention of working in small works of soft
            enamels use only <em>esmail d’azur</em>, which is blue, &amp;
            <em>esmail colombin</em>, which is the color of purple, which they
            soften with rocaille [small beads of glass?] or leaded glass. As for
            the yellow, they make it from silver, the red from sanguine, as is
            said elsewhere, the black &amp; gray &amp; shadows with <em>noir
                d’escaille</em> [scales black], either strong or weak, the flesh
            color with clear sanguine. The green is made first from yellow, then
            on top they coat <em>esmail d’azur</em>, either strong or weak,
            according to whether they want to make it bright or dark.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>While the author-practitioner shows a lively interest in vitreous enamels
        in this and other entries, his use of <em>esmail</em> in Ms. Fr. 640
        demonstrates that there was another category of <em>esmail</em> in the
        sixteenth century which current scholarship has largely
        overlooked—“cold” <em>esmail</em>. This term best describes the
        remainder of the <em>esmail</em> recipes in the manuscript, for which
        the method described is to mix a powdered pigment into a resinous
        solution or an oil-based mixture, and then to apply it to a substrate
        before leaving it to dry.<a href="#fn14"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref14"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> Such “cold <em>esmail</em>” is
        essentially paint, and is not to be confused with the “painted enamel”
        technique associated with Limoges.</p>
    <p>Thus, another term is necessary to differentiate this type of enameling
        from heat-processed vitreous enamels, and for this, “cold enamel” seems
        most appropriate as it highlights what is most distinctive about this
        method. Indeed, in a key contribution Tamar Davidowitz suggested the
        term “cold enamel” be used to describe translucent paint layers most
        commonly found on metal substrates.<a href="#fn15"

        Antecedents: <em>Émail Brun</em> and Cold Enamels</h2>
    <p>To understand the relationship between cold enamel and vitreous enamel,
        it is helpful to look at the etymology of the term “enamel” and the
        history of its associated objects.&nbsp;The oldest European form of the
        word “enamel” seems to be the Middle High German word <em>smeltzen</em>
        (to melt), which was followed by the old French <em>esmail</em>, from
        which we derive the English “enamel.”<a href="#fn22"

           role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a> so this material history as well
        as the etymology of the word suggest that the term was originally
        associated with vitreous enamels and then applied to oil- and
        resin-based enamels that were capable of achieving a similar glossy and
        translucent effect.</p>
    <p>A possible antecedent to “cold enamel” can be found in the work of
        twelfth- and thirteenth-century German coppersmiths found on armor in
        the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna.<a href="#fn24"

        enamel or <em>champlevé</em>.<a href="#fn25"

           role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a> Instead, it is a sort of
        “encaustic” process, practiced in regions along the Rhine and Maas in
        Westphalia and Hesse, that involves a coat of linseed oil upon red
        copper that is then charred in the kiln to a deeper or lighter tint of
        brown.<a href="#fn26"

    <p><em>Braunemaille</em> is broadly defined as a medieval technique by which
        oil varnish (or linseed oil) was burnt into metal. It is present in the
        Corona Lucis at Buckfast Abbey in Devon, and on the funerary monument of
        Geoffroy Plantagenêt, count of Anjou Maine (1113–1151), where it appears
        concurrently with <em>champlevé</em> vitreous enameling.<a href="#fn27"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref27"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a> While this technique did involve
        heating, it also demonstrated the possibility of achieving color and
        translucence without vitreous material, and the use of both these
        techniques together on earlier medieval objects may offer a clue that it
        was a technique originally employed as a way of achieving a similar or
        complementary visual effect, since resin and glass can have very similar
        reflective indices when the resin is freshly laid, although resin
        darkens over time. While not definitive, this gives us a clue as to when
        and how non-vitreous enamels were conceived of as potential alternatives
        to vitreous ones.</p>
    <p>That <em>Braunemaille</em> has been found intact on some early modern
        suits of armor at the Kunsthistorisches Museum further supports a
        connection with the tradition of encaustic.<a href="#fn28"

        survived into the Baroque is hinted at by a line in John Evelyn’s 1662
        <em>Sculptura</em>: “Silver, to fill with a certain Encaustic or black
        Enamel.” This quotation is listed by the Oxford English Dictionary as
        one of the early usages of the word “encaustic” which has led to its
        current definition, and it seems to suggest a time when <em>niello</em>,
        too, was understood as a type enamel because it was a type of coloring
        applied to metal for decoration.<a href="#fn29"

        Experimental Perspective</h2>
    <p>Excluding the enamel recipes that mention enamel but do not identify
        specific ingredients and directions for making <em>esmail</em>, the
        recipes in the manuscript fall into two categories: directions for
        making either “azure” or “rouge clair” <em>esmail</em>. In order to
        better understand what is meant by <em>esmail</em> we recreated multiple
        recipes for both “rouge clair” and “azure” enamels.</p>
    <h3 id="rouge-clair">Rouge Clair</h3>
    <p>There are three entries for rouge clair in Ms. Fr. 640, one recipe that
        requires heat (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/124v/f/124v/tl"><u>124v</u></a>)
        and two cold enamel recipes (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/6r/f/6r/tl"><u>6r</u></a>
        and fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/40v/f/40v/tl"><u>40v</u></a>).
        The recipe on fol. 124v only includes instructions on the application of
        the enamel and not instructions for how to prepare it. However, it is
        still worth noting because it focuses on how best to pair red enamel
        with gold, while fols. 6r and 40v—which address cold enamels—allow for
        both gold and silver.<a href="#fn36"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref36"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
    <p>This difference between hot and cold enamels is significant because
        vitreous red enamels were traditionally paired exclusively with gold.<a
           href="#fn37"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref37"

           id="fnref38"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>38</sup></a> Yet it should be noted that cold
        enamels could also exceed their vitreous counterparts in versatility,
        not just in the delicate forms to which they could be applied, but in
        the substrates they could pair with—perhaps because their material
        ingredients were less reactive with their substrates or because of the
        ease in removing them and retouching them if they were damaged, or if
        their colors changed with age. According to Gaborit-Chopin, it was a
        common practice in the first half of the fourteenth century to paint the
        faces and hands of metal statues, and the ease with which paint could be
        applied meant that these works could be easily maintained through
        retouching.<a href="#fn39"

    <p>It seems that red and green were the most translucent colors obtained for
        cold enamels and that they were frequently painted on silver, while blue
        was not—a significant fact to note since red vitreous enamel was usually
        paired with gold, and blue vitreous enamel with silver.<a href="#fn40"
           class="footnote-ref"

        <em>rogio chlero</em> onto silver or copper, though it can be done on
        gold. Notably, he warns that if the red enamel is not immediately cooled
        with bellows, the red color may turn yellow so that it does not stand
        out against the gold.<a href="#fn41"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref41"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>41</sup></a> Yet, the author-practitioner
        provides a similar warning for his rouge clair recipe on fol. <a

        which mentions heating it to restore its color and cautions that it will
        fade if applied to pure gold because it will seem too pale. He does not
        give the same warning for the cold enamel rouge clair recipes, saying
        that they will pair with copper and silver, showing a significant
        difference in the practices of applying hot and cold enamels in terms of
        versatility.</p>
    <p>In our experiments, rouge clair appeared brightest against gold. Those
        samples that we applied to silver darkened as they dried so that only
        the lighter rouge clair, with a higher ratio of resin to pigment still
        displayed the refractive qualities that vitreous enamels and paint
        glazes are known for. This is to say, the translucence allows light to
        penetrate these “enamels,” reflecting on the metal substrate and
        producing a radiant effect. We only tested this against copper and gilt
        pieces of silver foil and gold leaf, so we did not see the effect on a
        three dimensional object; we would assume that on a vertical silver
        surface the occurrence of a thick pigment layer would be less
        problematic since the cold enamel layer would have to be applied very
        thinly to prevent running, or it would ruin the delicacy of the work.

    <p>As with sixteenth-century vitreous Limoges enamels, the substrate for
        painting metal with oil-based translucent paints was often copper.<a

    <h2 id="lifecasting-and-delicate-forms">Lifecasting and Delicate Forms</h2>
    <p>The <em>esmail</em> described in Ms. Fr. 640 is intended for application
        to metal surfaces such as gilt, shaped, and cast items, but also to
        surfaces such as glass and hard stones. While the absence of heating may
        at first seem strange since the author-practitioner was writing during
        the peak popularity of <em>basse taille</em> enameling in Limoges, it
        may be useful to consider this absence in the context of the
        author-practitioner’s familiarity with lifecasting. While the practice
        of cold enameling was not limited to lifecasting, cold enamels were
        often applied to delicate areas that would have been difficult to color
        with vitreous enamels, in order to enhance the lifelikeness of the
        object.<a href="#fn45"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref45"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>45</sup></a> In particular, vitreous
        enameling requires intense heat that can adversely affect gilding and is
        usually not suitable for delicate forms that can lose their shape under
        high heat. Cold enamels, on the other hand, could be applied to very
        thin and fine works, as can be seen in a table ornament by Wenzel
        Jamnitzer (<i><u>Fig. 6</u></i>).<a href="#fn46"

    <p>Delicacy would seem to be a concern for the author-practitioner as he
        includes recipes for applying <em>esmail</em> to gold leaf (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/136r/f/136r/tl"><u>136r</u></a>)
        and imitation gold leaf (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/6r/f/6r/tl"><u>6r</u></a>).
        However, when discussing “A way to enamel very delicate gold rose leaves
        and others” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/116r/f/116r/tl"><u>116r</u></a>),
        which would seem to be close to the description of the fine vegetal
        forms seen in Jamnitzer’s table ornament, the author-practitioner seems
        to suggest another type of <em>esmail</em> since he writes:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>After you have cast or beaten in gold the thin leaves of a rose or
            other things, if you want to enamel them, you need to solder or
            braze your delicate gold leaves onto silver strips, which will
            strengthen them to support the enamel. Next, once the thing has been
            enameled, put the work in aquafortis, which will eat away the silver
            &amp; leave all the gold with its enamel. For this, the gold needs
            to be passed with <em>ciment real</em>.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>However, the author-practitioner also
        mentions applying <em>esmail</em> to burnished gold leaf and silver foil
        surfaces (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/6r/f/6r/tl"><u>6r</u></a>)
        which may suggest a flat surface such as a panel painting or altarpiece,
        like the 1466 Herlin Altarpiece (St. Jakob’s church, Rothenburg ob der
        Tauber), or a wooden sculpture covered in foil.<a href="#fn47"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref47"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>47</sup></a> Rather than being a description
        of a material or a technique, <em>esmail</em> seems to indicate coloring
        a hard surface by applying paint without ground layers.</p>
    <p>At the same time, it appears to have been accepted terminology with
        regard to ceramics as the equally well-known French lifecasting
        ceramicist Bernard Palissy referred to his glazes as <em>esmail.</em><a
           href="#fn48"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref48"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>48</sup></a> Although the process of ceramic
        glazing and firing is not described in Ms. Fr. 640, we should take it
        into account when considering the range of meanings applied to
        <em>esmail.</em></p>
    <h2 id="imitation-gems">Imitation Gems</h2>
    <p>Additionally, the author-practitioner presents another use of
        <em>esmail</em> in relation to imitating and enhancing gems:
        specifically, in a recipe titled “Enameling a cornaline” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/104r/f/104r/tl"><u>104r</u></a>).
        This practice is in line with a long tradition of dyeing and
        heat-treating gems in order to enhance their color, which is mentioned
        at least as far back as Pliny and in the sixteenth century in
        Giambattista della Porta’s 1558 work <em>Magia Naturalis</em>, in a
        chapter on the dyeing of stones. Although the recipe in Ms. Fr. 640 is
        about “enameling a cornaline,”&nbsp;it does not seem to have any
        ingredients in common with the red and blue <em>esmail</em> that is
        meant to be applied to metal; instead, it calls for a heat treatment
        (fol. 104r):</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Soak some wheat flower [sic] in white wine, then besmear &amp; cover
            the whole cornaline with it. And bring the violet kind to heat
            again, next put it to temper in white wine for one or two hours,
            then scratch it &amp; leave the part you want to save on it, then
            reload it a little more on top.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>This suggests that within the manuscript,
        <em>esmail</em>&nbsp;is used to describe processes that may or may not
        include heat, and that enamel is understood to describe the glass-like
        visual effect rather than the materials or processes involved.</p>
    <p>Taken together with the imitation gem enamel recipes, the <em>esmail</em>
        recipes imply that the author-practitioner had an interest in hot
        <em>esmail</em> and transformation for the sake of adornment (either
        with jewels or with buttons), as well as an interest in producing these
        adornments through inexpensive and artificial means. He seems to have
        been more concerned with creating artificial gems that could pass a
        visual test rather than ones that could stand up to close expert
        scrutiny. Although the lapidary work of Swiss naturalist and physician
        Conrad Gessner (1516–1565) is among book titles listed on the first two
        folios of the manuscript, the author-practitioner’s observations seem
        less driven by Gessner’s interests in natural philosophy and more
        similar in tone to the anonymous recipe, “To make stones for rings, that
        is to say, precious gems clear and of fine color,” found in the
        Bolognese manuscript “Ad Lapides Anullorum Componendos.”<a href="#fn49"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref49"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>49</sup></a> There does not seem to be any
        thought given in Ms. Fr. 640 to the idea that the imitation gems might
        be tested by weight or hardness, or even rubbed or scratched to see if
        the color was consistent beneath the surface, leaving the impression
        they would only have been looked at superficially from a distance,
        perhaps applied on objects, rather than being scrutinized for value and
        sale.</p>
    <p>As Marco Beretta, Maria Conforti, and Marjolijn Bol have discussed, an
        imitation was not necessarily a fake or a forgery, but sometimes
        considered an object made with a higher form of skill because it
        demonstrated an understanding of nature and the ability to recreate
        it.<a href="#fn50"

        seem to be recording impressions of the properties and uses of different
        stones. It seems unlikely, therefore, that he believes that he is
        actually recreating them; rather, he is outdoing nature by obtaining the
        desirable aspects of the things he is imitating (their visual effects)
        through different methods on a compressed timescale, circumventing
        nature’s ponderous course through the cleverness of artifice.<a

    <h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
    <p><em>Esmail</em> was a term both for a material and a set of material
        techniques that was widely used in the early modern period. The term
        <em>esmail</em> encompassed many meanings, which, at their most basic,
        all related to covering a substrate in a colorful substance that would
        leave it with a glossy and refractive finish on the surface. Cold
        enameling—a technique imitating the refractive and coloring effects of
        vitreous enamel—has largely been forgotten because of an evolution in
        the nomenclature of art categories. Sharing its name with a substance
        that we now typically think of as vitreous heat-process enameling, cold
        enameling actually bears strong resemblance to glazes in painting, and
        it shares many ingredients with varnishes. It may rightly be described
        as a type of paint; however, that would fail to capture the goal of cold
        enameling. Although cold enameling may have begun as a way to imitate
        the refractive indices of vitreous enamels, it surpassed them in
        versatility, ease of control, and potential for applying a variety of
        colors to different substrates.</p>
    <p>In his recipes, the author-practitioner demonstrates a knowledge of both
        hot and cold enamels and the methods required for the making of each,
        while showing a stronger interest and potentially a preference for cold
        enamels. Regarding the uses of cold enamels, he describes ways to add
        realism and naturalism to delicate objects, depict colorful stories on
        glass, and recreate the dazzle of expensive gems, while exploiting the
        natural advantages of economically less valuable materials. This points
        to an interest in identifying the essence of visual effects inherent to
        one material in order to capture them and spirit them across material
        borders by recreating them in other media.</p>
    <p>The author-practitioner’s particular interest in cold enamels supports
        the possibility that he was a lifecaster himself, potentially of small
        and delicate works, and affirms his attention to a variety of optical
        qualities and his determination to recreate them across media. This is a
        pursuit that may be thought of as an interest in isolating what is
        inherent to, or definitive of, a particular material’s optical qualities
        in order to understand what it is that actually produces certain visual
        effects—a form of “practical optics.” In the realm of <em>esmail,</em>
        recognizing this interest can help us to better apprehend why the
        author-practitioner would have considered cold <em>esmail</em> as part
        of the category of <em>esmail</em> and help us to reconsider how
        materials were understood and categories were defined in the sixteenth
        century.</p>

                    Gerard Leigh’s 1562 <em>Accedence of Armory</em>) seems to
                    have first come into use in English in the fourteenth

                <p>Indeed, gold is an ideal base for translucent enamel, since
                    no discoloring oxide layer forms at the interface between
                    the glass and the metal. For the same reason, enameling on
                    base metals like copper and brass can lead to a dull
                    appearance. See David Buckton, “Enameling on Gold: A
