        <div>
            <p>The making of portrait medals and the proliferation of “books of
                secrets” in sixteenth-century Europe form an important
                historical context for “Casting in frames” on fol. <a
                   href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/118v/f/118v/tl"><u>118v</u></a>.
                This entry contains detailed instructions for making “sand” for
                molding and casting a portrait medal. This essay reconstructs
                the making and casting of a sand mold (with productive
                failures), and compares Ms. Fr. 640 to contemporaneous texts
                containing similar techniques, such as Vannoccio Biringuccio's
                <em>Pirotechnia</em> (1540) and the <em>Secreti del Reverendo
                    Donno Alessio Piemontese</em> (first printed 1555).</p>

    <p>The recipe “Casting in frames” on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/118v/f/118v/tl"><u>118v</u></a>
        appears after a dense grouping of recipes that detail various forms of
        casting, such as “<em>en noyau</em>” casting (casting with a core) and
        the casting of flowers. The frame casting recipe lays out how to produce
        “sand” (<em>sable</em>) and how to heat the mold, devoting little
        attention to the casting of metal itself. As this essay will show, this
        emphasis can be explained through the process of reconstruction in
        conjunction with examination of relevant textual sources. Further, this
        recipe should be understood through its presumed aim of producing
        portrait medals, whose popularity in late sixteenth-century France
        aligns with the dating of the manuscript to the late sixteenth century.

    <h2 id="study-and-reconstruction-of-the-recipe">Study and Reconstruction of
        the Recipe</h2>
    <p>The author-practitioner begins the entry by describing the production of
        sand made by grinding cores from previously used molds, which are
        composed of plaster, brick, and feather alum.<a href="#fn1"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref1"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> It is unsurprising that sand
        would be reused, as this is still common practice today in metal
        foundries, where sand casting is the main technique used for the
        production of industrial machine parts.<a href="#fn2"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref2"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> In our reconstructions, the only
        previously used cores available lacked feather alum, which was mentioned
        as necessary for plaster molds by the author-practitioner.<a href="#fn3"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref3"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> This ingredient, “<em>alun de
            plume</em>,” could refer to asbestos or other minerals such as
        feldspar or gypsum; in modern terms, it refers to the mineral
        Halotrichite, which is made of soft, parallel strands of a white color,
        which has the appearance of a feather.<a href="#fn4"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref4"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> Whatever it was, “<em>alun de
            plume</em>” appears to have been important as a binding agent, but
        for which no substitute was introduced for the previous molds (<i><u>Fig. 1</u></i>). This omission made it possible for us to pass the
        sand through a sieve, which the feather alum rendered impossible for the
        author-practitioner (<i><u>Fig. 2</u></i>). Given the time needed to
        break down the old molds, even using a sieve, one can only imagine the
        time needed to grind these molds to a “very soft” consistency without
        one, as the manuscript directs. In the recipe, the author-practitioner
        then outlines the preparation of sal ammoniac water (a solution of
        ammonium chloride and water) using two portions of sal ammoniac the size
        of walnuts (<em>noix</em>), a process similar to that described in an
        earlier recipe on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/111v/f/111v/tl"><u>111v</u></a>,
        which calls for portions of sal ammoniac the size of chestnuts.
        Following the manuscript, this solution was mixed with eau-de-vie
        (interpreted as brandy) and the sand we had produced through the
        grinding and sieving process (<i><u>Fig. 3</u></i>). We then pressed the
        mixture into the female half of the mold over the medal (<i><u>Fig. 4</u></i>). The recipe calls for a finished medal as a pattern,
        but we used molded plaster models, which we thought a reasonable
        substitute. The author-practitioner does not stipulate the process of
        packing the sand into the mold; we found this required a great deal of
        time, as the medal was placed facing upwards as small quantities of sand
        were slowly layered on top of each other with additions of sand or water
        to adjust the mixture as needed.

    <p>After the molding of the medal, the author-practitioner describes marking
        the medal’s side and reverse, as well as the sand, a step whose function
        was not immediately clear to us, so we omitted it. Prior to filling the
        male side with sand, the recipe calls for dusting the entire side of the
        female mold with charcoal (“<em>charbon pulverisé</em>”), just as the
        medal itself had been dusted before insertion into the female side (<i><u>Fig. 5</u></i>). In our reconstruction, this step proved very
        effective when later separating the male and female molds. After dusting
        with charcoal, the author-practitioner warns specifically not to disturb
        the medal in order to remove it from the mold. The function of marking
        the location of the medal earlier then became clear, as the
        author-practitioner explains that he supported the area of the box mold
        where the medal was (presumably the point marked) and then struck the
        back of the mold with his hand. Evidently, on rereading his text, the
        author-practitioner rethought the word “struck” (“<em>frappé</em>”),
        adding a note in the margin that he had not struck it, “but rather
        pressed it only with the strength of my hands” to avoid distorting it (<i><u>Fig. 6</u></i>).</p>

                describe the author-practitioner’s striking of the mold, but he
                added a note in the margin that he did not strike the box mold
                but, rather, pressed it with his hands (<em>lay presse de la
                    seule force des mains</em>) to avoid distorting the
                impression. Source: gallica.bnf.fr. Blue highlights added by

    </div>
    <p>A major concern of the author-practitioner was the heating and drying of
        the frame molds. Had the medal not separated after striking the molds,
        the author-practitioner explains that he would have heated them. During
        reconstructions we were far less patient, opting not to heat the mold to
        remove the plaster model. Rather, our technique for removing the plaster
        model was to insert a knife into the channel made for pouring, creating
        a wedge that could lift the model out (<i><u>Fig. 7</u></i>). Our
        impatience would prove more problematic when we did not heed the
        author-practitioner’s next step: heating the molds by resting them on
        two iron trivets with the imprinted side facing upwards. The
        author-practitioner’s insistence on this point can be found in the small
        drawing in the right margin and a corresponding marginal note
        emphasizing the proper spacing of the trivets (<i><u>Fig. 8</u></i>).
        While the recipe ends here, not explaining how in fact to pour the
        medal, there are two further marginal notes that explain what is meant
        by heating the mold (<i><u>Fig. 9</u></i>). As a result, our decision to
        let the molds sit in a laboratory fume hood overnight and warm for five
        to ten minutes in a fairly low oven was inadequate preparation for
        casting, as the moisture in our molds caused imperfections in the
        coloration and details of the medals during casting (<i><u>Fig. 10</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 11</u></i>). The author-practitioner’s second marginal
        note, which emphasizes the need to “redden the box mold” for gold and
        silver, proved especially prescient: when pouring silver into one box
        mold during reconstruction, steam and a spray of silver erupted from the
        the mold, as the moisture retained in the sand turned explosively to
        steam (<i><u>Fig. 12</u></i>). The resulting silver medal is a perfect
        snapshot of what occurred inside the mold as the steam forced the molten
        silver out of the mold and up through the gate (<i><u>Fig. 13</u></i>).

    <p>An understanding of the properties of the sand and the need to heat the
        mold can be gained by consulting fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/161r/f/161r/tl"><u>161r</u></a>,
        “Preparation of sand for frames.” This recipe outlines a nearly
        identical process of breaking up previously used cores with a stick to
        create sand, soaking the sand in sal ammoniac, baking the sand in a
        furnace until it reddens, and grinding it up again. This entry on fol.
        161r gives insight into the value of using sand from previously used
        cores, as it explains that through the repetition of this process, the
        sand will reach a state such that it does not separate from the box
        mold. The author-practitioner also stresses the importance of heating
        the mold adequately so that the sal ammoniac can calcine properly. The
        presence of Latin terms in the recipe on fol. 161r, “<em>gip de
            lateribus</em>” (a type of mortar?) and “<em>alumen jameni</em>” (a
        type of alum?), suggests a textual source for this recipe, which could
        not be identified based on these phrases.</p>

    <p>Knowledge of the production of medals certainly traveled from Italy to
        France with Italian artisans, the best known of which are Francesco
        Laurana in the fifteenth century and Benvenuto Cellini in the sixteenth
        century. While portrait medals were produced in France by goldsmiths
        beginning in the fifteenth century, Mark Jones has demonstrated that in
        France, centers for medal making developed around Lyon—the center of
        French trade with the Italian peninsula—and reached their apogee of
        manufacture between the second half of the sixteenth century and the
        early seventeenth century.<a href="#fn13"

    <p>The appearance, function, and understanding of medals in France differed
        somewhat from that in Italy. In the sixteenth century, French medals
        deemphasized erudite pairings of emblems and individual portraits in
        favor of standard images of French monarchs, and the function of such
        objects seems to be more closely centered on exchange with the royal
        court as a means of currying favor.<a href="#fn14"

        of France, sister of the Duc de Berry, and features engravings of coins

    <p>Portrait medals were also linked to the academies that developed in late
        sixteenth-century France. The statutes of the first royally sanctioned

        the making of “<em>medallions</em>” to regulate the admission of
        members, as Frances Yates has discussed.<a href="#fn17"

        their use of the ingredients matches his own. For example, the

        of sal ammoniac should be “moderately salty” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/118v/f/118v/tl"><u>118v</u></a>).
        By presenting his text as a recipe, the author-practitioner seems to
        aligns himself with the tradition of Renaissance books of secrets.
        William Eamon explains that the use of a “recipe” to record technical
        information was a common trait of books of secrets, distinguishing them
        from the “descriptive-historical” method that characterized authors like

    <p>The casting of portrait medals might be viewed as part of a broader early
        modern interest in the transformation of materials. Along with knowledge
        of the heavens and understanding of the body, the ability to manipulate
        materials provided a key impetus for interest in the acquisition of
        knowledge about nature. Yet metallurgy and casting remained a mostly
        embodied endeavor during this time. Because expertise in metalworking
        frequently garnered the support and patronage of the nobility and
        royalty, the practitioner often saw it in his best interest to keep this
        knowledge to himself and mine it for its potential social and political
        expediency. Biringuccio’s <em>Pirotechnia</em>, however, discussed the
        technical details of mining gold ore openly within the framework of
        knowledge acquisition, dismissing such craft secrecy as a duplicitous
        method of suggesting expertise and technique where it did not exist.
        From Biringuccio’s characterization of this phenomenon, though, it is
        evident that secrecy was indeed a common trope in such works.<a

        display numerous medicinal remedies and medical knowledge, Ms. Fr. 640
        records little of note in this regard; it betrays a comparative lack of
        focus on healing procedures when juxtaposed with Piemontese’s

    <p>Why, however, did the author-practitioner write Ruscelli’s name in the
        manuscript if his own text bears greater overall similarity to the
        <em>Secreti</em>—ascribed to Alessio Piemontese—than to the <em>Secreti
            nuovi</em>? It may be that Ruscelli’s presumed authorship of the
        <em>Secreti</em> was commonplace knowledge by the time of the
        manuscript’s writing. Yet recent studies suggest a different story. At
        the conclusion of their careful examination of the publication history
        of the <em>Secreti</em>, Massimiliano Celaschi and Antonello Gregori
        argue that while Ruscelli’s peers in Venice (where the text was first
        published) were clearly aware that the name Piemontese was synonymous
        with Ruscelli, the continued reprinting of the <em>Secreti</em> across
        Europe under the name Piemontese would have obscured this fact.<a

    <p>A comparison of the recipe for sand casting in Ms. Fr. 640 to the
        <em>Secreti</em> and Biringuccio’s <em>Pirotechnia</em> reveals many
        parallels between the techniques described in the two processes as well

        here.<a href="#fn37"

           role="doc-noteref"><sup>39</sup></a> The author-practitioner of Ms.
        Fr. 640, by comparison, stresses instead that any grease or oil on the
        medal should be <em>removed</em>, and charcoal should be applied at
        numerous stages in the mold-making process. Like Ms. Fr. 640, the
        <em>Secreti</em> and <em>Pirotechnia</em> both place significant
        emphasis on drying the molds over a fire but devote no time in this
        section to the actual pouring of the medal.<a href="#fn40"

    <p>While the author-practitioner of Ms. Fr. 640 included over forty entries
        that include “sand” in the title, many of them indicating the ideal
        properties of sand, as well as where and how to procure it, they discuss
        an extremely diverse variety of “sands.” Biringuccio and Ruscelli, by
        comparison, offer very detailed steps for preparing general categories
        of sands, each using different types of clays and powders that can be
        employed in any combination. Following the recipe for “The true and most
        perfect practice of molding medals,” the <em>Secreti</em> includes a
        list of seven different types of sand (“<em>Terra prima da gittarvi i
            metalli fusi</em>,” “<em>Terra seconda</em>,” “<em>Terra
            terza</em>,” etc.) (<i><u>Fig. 22</u></i>).<a href="#fn41"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref41"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>41</sup></a> Throughout their texts, the
        desired qualities of such sands remain the same: “the goodness and
        perfection of each sand in which to cast fused metals consists in the
        following: that they are very soft, as if impalpable, because the
        designs are imprinted very clearly.”<a href="#fn42"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref42"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>42</sup></a> Such information was carried

           id="fnref43"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>43</sup></a> The author-practitioner, too,
        was very concerned with the properties of casting sands, and used the
        same standard of impalpability in his recipes. “Impalpable” thus appears
        to have been a widespread technical term. The author-practitioner did
        not place his great variety of sands into categories as did the other
        texts, but they shared the same concerns for identifying the ideal
        function for each variety of sand.

                    emblems, the French term <em>devise</em> is understood to
