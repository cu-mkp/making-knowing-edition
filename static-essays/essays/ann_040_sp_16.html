                of BnF Ms. Fr. 640 shows that this particular varnish was not
                intended as a finishing layer to protect the paint and give it a
                sheen, as was customary in the sixteenth century. Instead, it
                functioned as an ingredient in the process and as a means of
                creating a specific optical effect—that of imitation marble.</p>

    <h2 id="imitating-marble-historical-context">Imitating Marble: Historical
        Context</h2>
    <p>Since at least the first century CE, paint has been used to imitate
        colored hard stone such as marble or porphyry. Wall paintings dating
        from this period in Pompeii, for instance, have survived and show that
        the taste for these stones as decorative elements was not dependent on
        the use of the material itself.<a href="#fn1"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref1"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> Later, in fourteenth-century
        Italy, painted marble emerged as a popular decoration for the back of
        panel paintings, a practice that gained popularity in northern Europe in
        the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. Numerous examples are extant on
        the reverse side of panel paintings in museum collections and on the
        exteriors and integrated frames of small winged altarpieces such as Hans
        Memling’s 1480 <em>Triptych of Adriaan Reins</em> (<i><u>Fig. 1</u></i>)
        and a diptych of a Franciscan friar by Jan Provoost (ca. 1465–1529) (<i><u>Fig. 2</u></i>), both in the Sint-Janshospitaal in Bruges.</p>

    <p>Given the widespread employment of this technique to decorate the backs
        and frames of panels, it is perhaps surprising that detailed methods of
        creating an imitation marble pattern are not present in well-known early
        modern written treatises and books of secrets.<a href="#fn2"

        appears to be unusual among known texts on techniques. This recipe seems
        to lay out a method for producing an imitation marble or porphyry
        pattern on panel using layers of red lakes and a varnish made from larch
        resin (Venice turpentine) and spike lavender oil. Most of the over
        thirty entries in Ms. Fr. 640 devoted to the making and application of
        varnish employ varnish as a protective coating or as an optical
        enhancement, but this recipe uses varnish as an ingredient in, and
        integral part of the technique to create the visual effect of marble. In
        a comparison of the manuscript’s varnish recipes, a number of useful
        details come to light not only about the use of varnish in the late
        sixteenth century, but perhaps even some clues about the
        author-practitioner himself.</p>
    <p>The recipe on fol. 56r for “Varnish for distemper” (<em>Vernis pour
            destrempe</em>) presents an intriguing puzzle because it appears to
        describe a common technique, but its ambiguous wording posed a challenge
        for reconstruction, and its title raised the question of why it refers
        to the ingredients rather than to the product (imitation marble). Thus,
        analysis of this recipe necessitated clarifying both the materials and
        process.</p>
    <h2 id="reconstruction">Reconstruction</h2>
    <p>To reconstruct the recipe on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/56r/f/56r/tl"><u>56r</u></a><em>,</em>
        it was first necessary to understand its purpose and intended final
        product, and to establish the identity and availability of the materials
        described by the author-practitioner. His statement that with this
        recipe “you can make marble with distemper” (<em>Tu peulx fayre du mabre
            a destrempe</em>) suggests that this was a method for creating a
        type of painted imitation marbling like that found on the exterior or
        reverse of fifteenth- and sixteenth-century panel paintings, especially
        small-scale ones. Such paintings were often portable, rather than being
        attached to walls, and the reverse of the main panel was typically
        decorated with an illusionistic image such as grisaille figures or a
        painted pattern mimicking marble or porphyry. Painting or otherwise
        decorating the reverse of the panel also provided protection against the
        elements and lessened the likelihood of warping.<a href="#fn4"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref4"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> Imitation marbling was often used
        in furniture and architecture as well as paintings. It first gained
        popularity in Western Europe in trecento Italy, where the technique was
        probably based on imported Chinese and Arabic marble-patterned paper.<a

    <p>The types of varnishes mentioned in Ms. Fr. 640 can be divided into two
        categories, identified by Marjolijn Bol as those made with drying oils
        and those made with essential oils.<a href="#fn7"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref7"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> From the fifteenth through the
        sixteenth centuries, the predominant method of varnish-making involved
        the combination of a dessicative oil with a resin, which had to be
        melted using heat. This varnish was applied by hand, and was typically
        dried in the sun for a long period of time. In the sixteenth century,
        varnishes made from essential or distilled oils such as spike lavender
        oil (also known as aspic oil) abruptly appeared in Europe. This type of
        oil could dissolve the resin without heat. This is described on fol.
        56r, where spike lavender oil is used to dissolve Venice turpentine, a
        larch resin, into a clear liquid. These “cold varnishes” not only dried
        much faster than heated varnishes, but could also be applied thinly with
        a paintbrush. The result was a more brittle varnish that appears to have
        been mainly used on small-scale objects.<a href="#fn8"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref8"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> The reason behind this abrupt
        change is unclear, as essential oils were certainly available in Europe
        prior to the sixteenth century. Lavender oil, for example, was being
        produced through distillation in Burgundy since at least the fourteenth
        century.<a href="#fn9"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref9"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> However, the specific lavender
        oil used for varnish making, distilled from the spike lavender plant, is
        believed to only have become common in the second half of the sixteenth
        century, although it is mentioned in Hieronymus Brunschwig’s 1512
        <em>Liber De Arte Distillandi de compositis</em> along with oils of
        turpentine (referred to as <em>Balsams</em>) from juniper and
        rosemary.<a href="#fn10"

    <p>In Ms. Fr. 640, the comparison of the thirty-four entries on varnish
        reveals that the author-practitioner was equally familiar with hot and
        cold preparations of varnishes. There are sixteen recipes for making
        varnish with heat, and twelve that describe cold varnish (the remainder
        of the recipes are either ambiguous as to the production method, or omit
        instructions for making). There do not appear to be discernible
        differences in the author-practitioner’s treatment and specific
        knowledge of hot and cold varnishes.</p>
    <p>The recipe on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/56r/f/56r/tl"><u>56r</u></a>
        does not give the impression of firsthand experience. It is located in
        the main body of text, following a recipe for “Excellent tempering bath
        for cuirass bodies” and preceding the instructions for the “Painter” on
        fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/56v/f/56v/tl"><u>56v</u></a>.
        Fol. 56r contains no marginal annotations or additions, in contrast to
        the folio’s verso, fol. 56v, which is heavily annotated. The recipe
        “Varnish for distemper” is written clearly and presents a relatively
        straightforward method for the reader who has understood the process—to
        the first-time practitioner, the instructions are not clear. This could
        indicate that the author-practitioner was familiar with the process, or
        that it was a commonly known technique, which is confirmed by the many
        imitation marbled surfaces that survive from this period.</p>
    <p>Other recipes in Ms. Fr. 640 such as “Mastic varnish dry in a half hour”
        on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/97v/f/97v/tl"><u>97v</u></a>
        and “Black varnish for sword guard, bands for trunks, &amp;c” on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/4v/f/4v/tl"><u>4v</u></a>,
        which are extensively annotated with details and further instructions,
        suggest that the author-practitioner wrote from personal experience.<a

           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref11"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> In comparison, “Varnish for
        distemper” includes clearly described steps, but the lack of detail
        about the intended outcome of the process raised many questions for my
        reconstruction. First among these was the meaning of specific terms. The
        most difficult was <em>destrempe<strong>,</strong></em> a word found
        throughout Ms. Fr. 640, and indeed throughout early modern artistic
        literature, that can have a number of possible meanings.<a href="#fn12"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref12"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> As Cleo Nisse shows in her essay
        in this edition, <em>destrempe</em> is associated with what today is
        understood to be a distemper medium, which can include any protein and
        water-based binding medium (including egg or gum Arabic), but is most
        commonly used to mean an animal glue-based pigment.<a href="#fn13"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref13"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> I therefore chose to use rabbit
        skin glue in my reconstruction. Ms. Fr. 640 contains another recipe on
        fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/79v/f/79v/tl"><u>79v</u></a>,
        “For making varnish” that calls for a glue, probably as an isolation
        layer, before applying a spike lavender oil varnish. This recipe
        instructs: “Take some mastic, <em>sang <del>daRage</del>
            <sup>darac</sup></em>, gum arabic &amp; spike lavender oil, as much
        of one as the other, &amp; make them melt all together, &amp; before
        coating it, lay a coat of glue quite clear, &amp; let it dry.” I
        therefore chose glue as a binding medium for the first red lake and
        chalk layer to make “distemper marble” (<em>mabre a destrempe</em>).</p>
    <p>Similarly, <em>laque,</em> the French word for red lake pigments, refers
        broadly to any red organic colorant employed in the early modern period
        primarily for dyeing textiles.<a href="#fn14"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref14"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> Up until the eighteenth century,
        “lake” could refer to any dark red pigment. Cennini defines
        <em>lacca</em> as a manufactured red pigment and recommends buying it
        ready-made. <em>Lacca</em> was typically made from textile clippings,
        but this kind of red lake could be greasy and faded quickly. Another
        kind of red lake noted by Cennini is that derived from the resinous
        secretions of the <em>Kerria lacca</em> insect native to India and
        Southeast Asia. He described it as “dry, lean, grainy, so that it almost
        looks black and has a blood color. This can only be good and perfect.”<a
           href="#fn15"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref15"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> The grainy resin-lake needed to
        be mulled well before use and was recommended for panel paintings and
        fresco. Although “lake” is now used to denote a dye that has been
        adsorbed onto a substrate to make paint pigment, in the early modern
        period the term “lac” or “lacca” specifically referred to a red colorant
        that could be derived from a number of sources and techniques. The term
        <em>lac</em> or <em>lacca</em> is also found referring to red organic
        dyestuffs in general, encompassing kermes, madder, and sappanwood lakes
        as well as several other sources.<a href="#fn16"

    <p>One of the most challenging materials to determine in this recipe was
        <em>rose de gand,</em> for which I have been unable to find any
        additional references in contemporary sources. Although this ingredient
        was not ultimately included in the reconstruction (since it was only
        suggested as an alternative for red lake), I attempted to identify the
        pigment, which was doubly intriguing because of its geographic reference
        to <em>gand</em>, meaning the city of Ghent, in light of the popularity
        of imitation marbling in Flemish painting. The author-practitioner’s use
        of the word <em>rose</em> likely referred to the pigment type
        <em>roset,</em> which was a bright pink pigment made from brazilwood (or
        sappanwood), with additions of alum and chalk.<a href="#fn17"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref17"

        this pigment as specified by the author-practitioner in this recipe,
        which also calls for <em>rose</em> to be mixed with chalk. There is
        historical evidence for a specific, high quality red lake manufactured
        in England and traded through the Low Countries in the fifteenth century
        that could plausibly be the <em>rose de gand</em> to which the
        author-practitioner refers.<a href="#fn18"

        are noted throughout both contemporary and modern pigment literature for
        this quality. In the late Middle Ages and Renaissance, lakes made from
        brazilwood were the most common and also the most inexpensive red
        pigments. Red lakes from this material are found in the majority of
        panel paintings and manuscripts in the fifteenth century and were used
        particularly to manufacture marbled paper.<a href="#fn22"

    <p>More common materials such as <em>tourmentine claire de venise</em>
        (Venice turpentine) and <em>huile d’aspic</em> (spike lavender oil) are
        well known and are still manufactured today. Venice turpentine is used
        in three recipes for varnish in Ms. Fr. 640 and refers to turpentine
        derived from larch resin. It was a common varnish ingredient by the
        sixteenth century.<a href="#fn23"

        since antiquity; it is mentioned in the writings of Vitruvius,
        Dioscorides, Pliny, and Galen. In the Middle Ages it was regarded as one
        of the highest quality balsam resins, and, as previously noted, in later
        centuries writers such as Hieronymus Brunschwig remained very interested
        in balsams. Larch balsam gained the name “Venice turpentine” or
        “Venetian turpentine” in the fifteenth century, when it was distributed
        mainly through the Venice drug market.<a href="#fn24"

    <p>Spike lavender oil, mentioned in three Ms. Fr. 640 varnish recipes, is an
        essential oil derived through distillation of the spike lavender
        plant.<a href="#fn25"

        the use of spike lavender oil seems to be particularly important because
        of its “penetrating” effect (the dispersal of pigmentation similar in
        appearance to the addition of water to oil) on the second red wine lake
        paint layer, crucial to the production of the marbled pattern.</p>
    <h3 id="technique">Technique</h3>
    <p>The recipe “Varnish for distemper” specified three steps. First, the
        distemper layer made with lake and chalk must be applied to the support.
        With the understanding that this was a recipe for imitation marbling
        such as that found on the back of panel paintings, I decided to use an
        oak panel for the support. Unsure at first of whether or not the backs
        of panels were typically gessoed, my first attempt at reconstruction
        used an unprimed oak panel (<i><u>Fig. 3</u></i>). The second step of the
        recipe called for a red lake mixed with wine to be painted over the
        first distemper layer, so that the entire area appeared a solid red (<i><u>Fig. 4.</u></i>). The final step was the application of varnish (<i><u>Fig. 5</u></i>).</p>

    <p>First, the varnish had to be made by combining Venice turpentine and
        spike lavender oil. Then this varnish was to be applied to the red lake
        wine layer, revealing light and dark areas: “And all will appear red,
        but the varnish you will put here, which will penetrate, will make
        appear dark &amp; light that which ought to be thus” (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/56r/f/56r/tl"><u>56r</u></a>).
        The recipe did not specify how the application was to be done, what
        tools were to be used, nor what the final product should look like.
        Instead, the recipe ends after the above description with a note about
        the use of spike lavender varnish, cautioning the reader against its use
        as varnish for panel paintings (probably referring here to a varnish
        over paint on the obverse of the panel, and not the reverse or exterior
        wings): “Pure spike lavender oil varnish is not good for panels, for
        spike lavender oil is too penetrating &amp; makes colors sparkle, unless
        it was made long ago” (fol. 56r).<a href="#fn26"

    <p>As I was unsuccessful in finding any comparable contemporary instructions
        for creating imitation marble, I turned to modern conservation reports
        for clues as to how the marbling effect was achieved in paint and
        varnish. Jill Dunkerton’s report for the conservation of Jan van Eyck’s
        portrait of his wife Margaretha, restored at the National Gallery in
        London in 2008, proved extremely helpful (<i><u>Fig. 6</u></i>).
        Dunkerton found that the varnish on the marbled rear of the painting was
        comprised of a heat-bodied linseed oil and pine resin mixture, different
        materials from the larch balsam turpentine and spike lavender oil that
        the author-practitioner calls for (<i><u>Fig. 7</u></i>).<a href="#fn27"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref27"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a> Van Eyck used a black base
        (where the author-practitioners used a red lake and chalk distemper
        layer), and then topped this base layer with a spattering of distemper
        (probably glue-based) of red lake mixed with vermillion and chalk, as
        well as black, greyish white, and bright vermillion. Whereas the recipe
        in Ms. Fr. 640 specifies a coat of varnish as the final, catalyzing
        layer (or what I assumed was a final top coat), Dunkerton believed that
        Van Eyck applied varnish in an intermediate layer between the first and
        last distemper-spattered paints.<a href="#fn28"

    <p>The vagueness of the Ms. Fr. 640 recipe for “Varnish for distemper” and
        the apparent dearth of contemporary recipes engendered several rounds of
        experimentation before I finally achieved a result that plausibly
        matched the description “marble with distemper.” I first tried painting
        the layers onto an unprimed oak board.<a href="#fn30"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref30"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a> Since technical analysis
        revealed that the back and front of Jan van Eyck’s <em>Margaretha</em>
        panel had been primed with gesso, I then undertook the steps outlined on
        fol. 56r on a gessoed panel.<a href="#fn31"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref31"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a> Since the recipe mentions that
        the light rose distemper layer needed to dry before the dark red wine
        lake layer was painted over it, it was notable that it did <em>not</em>
        specify whether or not that layer should dry before the varnish was
        applied to it. Therefore on both unprimed oak and gessoed board, I tried
        applying varnish to one panel when the dark red wine lake was completely
        dry, and to one panel immediately after painting out the lake. In both
        trials I had applied the varnish over the two lake layers with a brush
        in a single coat and was disappointed in the apparent lack of any visual
        effect resembling marbling. I could tell, however, that the varnish
        applied to wet lake seemed to affect the color and light-dark contrast
        of the two lake layers much more dramatically than when it was applied
        to dry paint (<i><u>Fig. 8</u></i>). It seemed that perhaps the problem
        was my application of the paint and varnish, rather than the support or
        the ingredients.</p>

        the author-practitioner stipulates that the varnish should be applied

        heat-made varnishes to panel paintings in the fifteenth century.<a

        provided the patterning for any dark-light differentiation that was
        occurring.<a href="#fn33"

        few minutes in my first trial). The longer mulling time, and the use of
        the granite slab rather than a glass surface, resulted in much smoother
        paints with brilliant, saturated jewel tones, which stood in stark
        contrast to the grainy and greyish paints I had produced the first time
        around (<i><u>Fig. 9</u></i>). I also experimented with the thickness
        and concentration of the first light rose distemper and the second dark
        red wine lake layers. In “Varnish for distemper” the thickness of each
        paint layer was not made clear, though single layers were strongly
        implied. On oak panels 3 and 4, I applied thick, opaque rose distemper
        layers as well as dark red wine lake layers (<i><u>Fig.10</u></i>). On
        gessoed panels 5 and 6, I applied thin layers. I also noted the presence
        of bubbles that, when dried, allowed the white gessoed ground to show
        through (<i><u>Fig. 11</u></i>). Whereas I had previously applied the
        paints thickly and took care to eliminate bubbles, I allowed them to
        remain in this second trial, thinking that it might be beneficial to the
        formation of the marbling pattern.<a href="#fn35"

        uniform and opaque paint layers showed significantly less patterning

    <p>The author-practitioner’s specification that the varnish made from Venice
        turpentine and spike lavender oil should “penetrate” the paint layers
        was especially intriguing in regard to the prescribed appearance of
        areas of dark and light, as I did not observe any major changes to the
        red lake layers when I applied a layer of varnish with a brush. Recall
        that the passage reads: “And all will appear red, but the varnish you

        the author-practitioner similarly notes in the margin, perhaps based on
        his own observations, that this varnish is “penetrating” and is not
        recommended for paintings because “Varnish of spike lavender oil is not

        the author-practitioner recommends applying a glue layer prior to this

        since the spike lavender varnish is intended to penetrate the wine lake
        layer but not the glue distemper layer underneath.</p>
    <p>I was finally able to successfully achieve a patterning that plausibly
        resembled marble or porphyry on gessoed panel 6 (<i><u>Vid. 1</u></i>).
        In this instance, I had applied a layer of distemper in which I allowed
        bubbles to settle and also did not correct variations in the thickness
        of the paint, meaning that when the distemper layer dried there were
        irregular areas of white ground showing through. I had found through
        previous trials that the varnish applied to wet wine lake appeared to
        produce a better effect (particularly in regard to light-dark contrast).
        On gessoed panel 6, I dribbled varnish onto the wet wine lake layer, and
        immediately witnessed the “penetration” of the varnish through the wine
        lake layer to reveal the lighter pink distemper layer beneath it. With a
        gloved finger, I made only one or two light strokes on the surface to
        achieve a marbled pattern, otherwise leaving the spotted dark-light
        pattern made by the varnish as it fell from the brush. The final result
        looked like something that could be called an imitation marble or
        porphyry (<i><u>Fig.12</u></i>), providing proof of concept that the
        method described by the author-practitioner could be effective in
        producing the desired result.<a href="#fn38"

    <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The recipe, “Varnish for distemper,” on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/56r/f/56r/tl"><u>56r</u></a>
        stands out among the many varied types of varnishes in Ms. Fr. 640. The
        majority of the thirty-four varnish recipes contained in Ms. Fr. 640
        seem intended for use as a finishing layer to provide protection and
        give gloss to objects. There are also numerous recipes for colored
        varnishes, such as “Color of gold without gold on silver” on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/29v/f/29v/tl"><u>29v</u></a>.
        In contrast, “Varnish for distemper<em>”</em> integrates the varnish
        into a process for achieving a specific visual effect—changing, not
        simply enhancing, the paint layer beneath it—rather than functioning as
        a protective layer, or as a coloring or binding agent.<a href="#fn39"

        varnish is creatively manipulated to achieve a visually compelling
        effect, using less costly means to imitate the surface appearances of
        heavy and expensive stones.</p>

                <p>Although data is scarce, there is some strong evidence that
                    essential oils were being produced in Europe from the Middle
                    Ages onward, and it is possible that they were imported from
                    the Far East prior to that. Oil of turpentine (a common
                    ingredient in varnish recipes) is mentioned by Herodotus
                    (484–425 BC), Pliny the Elder (23–79 AD), and Dioscorides
                    (ca. 40–90 AD). Dioscorides’ influential pharmacopoeia

                <p>Although essential oils appear to have been produced in
                    Europe prior to the sixteenth century, their primary use
                    seems to have been medicinal. Their widespread use in
                    varnish recipes seems to develop from the sixteenth century.

                <p>The name “lake” itself is derived from the Sanskrit word
                    <em>laksha,</em> via the Latin <em>lacca,</em> referring to
                    the lac insect that produced the resin-like substance from
                    which this pigment was made. The use of “lake” as a general
                    term for a dark-red pigment can be confusing, as the word
                    traditionally is understood as “a dark red pigment with the
                    particular properties of intense crimson colour and
                    translucency.” Jo Kirby, Maarten van Bommel, André

                <p>In a nineteenth-century recipe for imitation marble, a period
                    in which imitation marble appears to have been a popular
                    decoration in private homes, the author likewise recommends
                    a method of dribbling lighter colored paint over a darker
                    base layer (and recommends using distemper for faster drying
                    time although it will be a lesser quality), but the recipe
                    does not use varnish. See N. Whittock, <em>The Decorative

                <p>The bubbling was only present in the gessoed panels,

                <p>As can be seen on the transcription and facsimile of fol. 4r,
                    the author-practitioner corrects his description: he first
                    notes that spike lavender oil will cause the colors to
                    “die,” but then apparently later crosses this out and
                    rephreases the effect of the varnish as eating away at the

                <p>It is unclear in the varnish recipe on fol. 79v whether heat
                    was involved in the process. The author-practitioner’s
                    instructions are brief and vague, directing the maker to
                    “melt them [ingredients mastic, sandarac, gum arabic, and
                    spike lavender oil] all together.” It is unclear if “melt”
                    means to dissolve the ingredients together with heat, or if
                    it refers to the dissolution of the mastic (resin) in the
                    spike lavender oil that can be achieved by simply combining
                    these ingredients and stirring until unified. This latter
                    method is the manner in which the larch turpentine is

                <p>After three days the varnish was dry, but still tacky to the
                    touch. After one week, the varnish dried to form a hard
                    layer without stickiness. The optical effect of the varnish,
                    which enhanced the light-dark contrast of the colored
                    wine-lake layer beneath it, was even more apparent when the
                    varnish was fully dried.<a href="#fnref38"

                <p>Research on early modern varnishes is a difficult undertaking
                    due to the rarity of original varnish on surviving artworks.
                    Varnish tends to absorb dirt and smoke, and it often yellows
                    and clouds with age; it is an ephemeral material usually
                    removed and replaced by conservation treatments. Thus,
                    although there are a plethora of recipes in painters’
                    manuals and treatises from the early modern period, they
                    cannot be compared to surviving period varnishes. Moreover,
                    they contain many vague and confusing terms, typologies, and
                    uses for the varnishes.<a href="#fnref40"

                    hot and cold varnishes and their functions in Ms. Fr. 640.<a
