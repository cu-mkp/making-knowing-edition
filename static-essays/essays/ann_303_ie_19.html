        <div>
            <p>This essay explores the language of experience in Ms. Fr. 640 to
                characterize the place of experiential knowledge in the
                author-practitioner’s epistemology. Based on a concordance
                search of the terms <em>experience</em>, <em>experimenter</em>,
                <em>essayer</em>, <em>esprouver</em>, and <em>cognoistre</em>,
                the essay highlights the author-practitioner’s often overlapping
                use of these words and how they map onto the modes of writing
                down experience that can be identified in the manuscript:
                inferences from repeated experience, accounts of singular
                events, specific material tests, and invitations to further
                testing.</p>

    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
    <p>Following a description of the intriguing process of preserving flowers
        by drying them in sand, the author-practitioner lists a range of flowers
        which work well, including “amaranth &amp; suchlike, and broom, and
        others that your experience will teach you” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/121r/f/121r/tl"><u>121r</u></a>).
        Clearly regarding experience as a good teacher and an important source
        of knowledge, he not only writes down his own experiences with different
        flowers, but also enlists the reader’s experience in a process of
        ongoing exploration of nature and the possibilities of human
        intervention.</p>
    <p>By invoking experience as a teacher and a source of knowledge, the
        author-practitioner broached a lexical field which was becoming (and was
        still to become, over the following century or two) firmly associated
        with the practical knowledge of artisans and its increasingly confident
        articulations. It was, initially, a wide and not too finely
        differentiated field. Godefroy’s dictionary of medieval French, for
        instance, glosses <em>expérience</em> as <em>epreuve</em> or
        <em>essai</em> (themselves wide-ranging terms, as we shall see,
        including the meanings “proof,” “trial,” and “assay”) as well as the
        more general <em>connaissance acquise</em> (“acquired knowledge”).<a

            Français</em> (DMF) agrees with this definition, specifying that
        such knowledge could be acquired by observation, trial, or one’s own

        French-English dictionary, much beloved of Making and Knowing Project

        “proofe,” “tryall,” “essay,” “experiment,” and “experience,” while
        <em>expérience</em> itself is rendered as “experience,” but also
        “cunning, skill, knowledge, wisedome, gotten by much practise, and many
        trialls.”<a href="#fn4"

           role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> Later in the century, Antoine
        Furetière’s “<em>Universal</em> <em>dictionary containing [...] the
            terms of all the sciences and the arts</em>” (1690) gives a more
        explicit account of the relationship between experience and knowledge.
        The main entry for <em>experience</em> reads, “reiterated trial
        (<em>essay</em>) or test (<em>espreuve</em>) of some effect which serves
        our reason to come to an understanding (<em>connoissance</em>) of its
        cause.”<a href="#fn5"

           role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> Citing the hackneyed Hippocratic
        aphorism that life is short and experience long, the entry continues,
        “modern physics is preferable to that of the Ancients, inasmuch as the
        one began to reason on causes, and the other only reasons on
        experiences. Descartes said that he trusted the experiences of artisans
        more than the speculations of all the learned.”<a href="#fn6"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref6"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> In a sub-entry, Furetière
        mentions a more specialised use of the term: “among artisans and trade
        corporations, it signifies a half-masterpiece. Journeymen aspiring to
        mastership are obliged to make a masterpiece; the sons of masters only
        make a simple <em>experience</em>.”<a href="#fn7"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref7"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> By the end of the seventeenth
        century, according to Furetière, experience, as a way of reasoning and
        as proof of practical skill, had become codified into regimes of
        knowledge, both learned and artisanal.</p>
    <p>Ms. Fr. 640, written from within the artisanal culture of late
        sixteenth-century Toulouse, has a place in that story, which was of
        course not as linear as Furetière suggested. In fact, as far as the
        artisanal world was concerned, his assertion was little more than a
        learned acknowledgement of a culture of knowledge which had always been
        characterised by experience. When the author-practitioner invoked
        experience as a way of knowing, he participated in an already growing
        conversation about experiential forms of knowledge, their value, and
        their relationship with other epistemologies. This conversation spanned
        a range of written genres and was often associated with a set of common
        key terms denoting experiential knowledge, both in Latin and in the
        vernaculars which were increasingly becoming the language of choice for
        practical knowledge. In particular, the Latin terms <em>experientia</em>
        and <em>experimentum</em> (and their vernacular equivalents) embodied
        knowledge which was not derived by syllogistic deduction from universal
        principles but from personal experience of particulars. While
        <em>experientia</em> usually referred to experience or experiential
        knowledge in general, <em>experimentum</em> increasingly denoted
        specific snippets of insight from experience, in particular, individual
        medicinal recipes which had proven their worth in practice.<a
           href="#fn8"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref8"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> Within Western scholarly thought
        in the sixteenth century, dominated by the Aristotelian hierarchy of
        knowledges, experience was deemed inferior to rational
        <em>scientia</em>, but in practice, scholars of medicine in particular
        acknowledged the value of knowledge from natural particulars rather than
        universals, and from observation of individual cases.<a href="#fn9"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref9"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
    <p>New genres dedicated to observation and experience began to emerge, such
        as medical case notes known as <em>observationes</em> and
        <em>curationes</em>, or <em>practicae</em> containing
        <em>experimenta</em>.<a href="#fn10"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref10"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> The advent of printing also saw
        the proliferation of Books of Secrets, a highly successful genre dealing
        with craft knowledge and nature’s hidden workings. Since these secrets
        often relied on specific knowledge of nature and the arts, or on the
        manipulation of “occult” properties which, by definition, eluded the
        grasp of scholarly reasoning, experiential knowledge was the unofficial
        name of the game.<a href="#fn11"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref11"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
    <p>Recent scholarship, particularly the work of Elaine Leong, has
        characterised recipe books as another important (although heterogeneous)
        genre of experiential knowledge, especially outside the learned sphere.
        Early modern men and women, from nobles to modest householders,
        collected recipes, most often for medicines or foods, from friends and
        relations, correspondents, or books, according to their own means and
        interests. While these could initially be amassed haphazardly in rough
        books, many collectors developed inventive and rigorous regimes of
        testing their recipes through several iterations and transferred them to
        fair copy books or presentation copies, to be passed down the
        generations or to be published in print. At various points along the
        way, recipes changed in content and in epistemic status, from uncertain
        suggestions to tried-and-tested cures or foods, thus codifying in
        writing a way of knowing through repeated experience, as well as its
        results.<a href="#fn12"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref12"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> As we shall see, Ms. Fr. 640
        presents features which place it in close proximity to these
        experiential genres—medical casebooks and <em>experimenta</em>, books of
        secrets, and recipe books—although it does not precisely correspond to
        any one genre. As Vera Keller argues in one of her essays for this
        edition, Ms. Fr. 640 in fact marks a point in the slow emergence of what
        has been termed the “experimental essay” from recipes and related
        genres.<a href="#fn13"

    <p>In histories of science and medicine, discourses and practices of
        experiential knowledge are key to understanding the changes in early
        modern knowledge production from ca. 1500 to ca. 1700, often still
        referred to as a “Scientific Revolution.” Already in the 1940s, Marxist
        scholars posited that the experimental cultures and the shift towards
        inductive reasoning from particulars in the sixteenth and seventeenth
        centuries had its roots in artisanal cultures of learning by doing and
        in detailed attention to materials and bodies.<a href="#fn14"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref14"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> More recently, artists’ and
        artisans’ ways of knowing and their influence on scientific epistemology
        have been characterised by historians in more nuanced ways, but broadly
        confirming the central place of experiential knowledge in narratives of
        human understanding of nature.<a href="#fn15"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref15"

           id="fnref16"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> It is important to note,
        however, that individual references to “experience” or “experiment” do
        not signal participation in a single or well-defined scientific
        empiricism. As Alisha Rankin has pointed out, early modern approaches to
        nature were characterised by “a number of diverse, overlapping
        ‘empiricisms.’”<a href="#fn17"
           class="footnote-ref"

        practitioners differed in the way they used and understood such terms as

    <p>As an unusually detailed source of practical knowledge with a clear
        emphasis on things “which your experience will teach you,” Ms. Fr. 640
        adds its unique voice to the manifold genres and histories of
        experiential knowledge. As this essay shows, it presents anecdotes of
        single instances similar to medical cases, secrets of craft and nature,
        tried and tested recipes, and open questions for future trials. While
        this source undoubtedly calls for a full investigation of its language
        of expertise and knowledge transfer—not least what it means to “teach”
        someone—this essay begins to approach these questions by focusing on
        author-practitioner’s concept and language of experience.<a href="#fn19"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref19"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a> It provides an analysis of
        concordance searches for the lexical field of the terms
        <em>experience</em> and the related <em>experiment</em>, but also the
        language of trying and testing centred around the author-practitioner’s
        use of the verbs <em>esprouver</em> and <em>essayer</em>, and the
        relationship of these terms to the concept of <em>cognoissance</em> as
        knowledge in a more general sense as well as the verb
        <em>cognoistre</em> in the sense of recognizing or knowing. In exploring
        these terms, I show how they map onto different modes of writing down
        experience which can be identified in the manuscript: inferences from
        repeated experience, accounts of singular events, specific material
        tests, and invitations to further testing.</p>
    <h2 id="experience-and-experiment">Experience and Experiment</h2>
    <p>The French word <em>experience</em> itself is used in only three entries
        in the manuscript. They highlight the range of uses of the term in
        different modes of referring to experiential knowledge. In an entry on
        grafting trees, the author-practitioner writes, “one finds by experience
        that the graft that has its entrance into the incision on the sunny side
        takes very rarely” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/88r/f/88r/tl"><u>88r</u></a>).
        The insight into the process is asserted in the present tense and in a
        positive manner: it describes the usual and normal behavior of this kind
        of graft, presumably based on repeated observation of grafting in
        different ways. Similar assertions recur throughout the manuscript. The
        phrase “one finds by experience” (<em>on trouve par experience</em>)
        only occurs once, but the author-practitioner uses the shorter “one
        finds” (<em>on trouve</em>) to make similar claims, such as “one finds
        that [latten] comes out better alloyed with a quarter of copper” (fol.
        <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/70r/f/70r/tl"><u>70r</u></a>),
        or, in one of many entries on sand for molds, “I find that one ought not
        to knock on very finely ground sands, for it shakes them loose” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/87v/f/87v/tl"><u>87v</u></a>).
        Nearly half the instances of the verb <em>experimenter</em> convey the
        same sense of knowledge from repeated experience. For example, the
        author practitioner’s assertion “I have experienced
        [<em>experimenté</em>] that grinding <em>azur d’esmail</em> with egg
        yolk &amp; next washing it in several waters is good” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/11r/f/11r/tl"><u>11r</u></a>)
        speaks to a deep familiarity with the blue pigment which is evident in
        numerous other entries in the manuscript.</p>
    <p>While many such insights are no doubt owed to the author-practitioner’s
        hands-on practice, he also uses <em>experimenter</em> to relate less
        immediate experiences. Describing a treatment for poisonous snake bites,
        he writes, “it is the same with toad’s venom, which I have seen
        experimented [<em>experimenté</em>]” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/110r/f/110r/tl"><u>110r</u></a>),
        implying that he had witnessed such cures but not necessarily been
        personally involved. In an entry on catching snakes for molding, he
        shares the observation that “they hardly ever bite in water, which
        crayfish catchers experience [<em>experimentent</em>]” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/107r/f/107r/tl"><u>107r</u></a>)—an
        experiential insight which was not his own but that of a group of
        experts on aquatic life. This kind of assertion, referring to the usual
        properties and behavior of things based on accumulated past experience,
        is one of the major modes of writing experience in the manuscript.</p>
    <p>Another such mode is epitomized by the second occurrence of the word
        <em>experience</em>. Making ruby glass is a complex process in which
        gold leaf and a variety of mineral ingredients are melted at very high
        temperatures to achieve a red-tinted glassy substance, and it is not
        surprising that the author-practitioner did not succeed on the first
        attempt: “the first experience that I made of it, it only returned a
        yellow mass” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/101r/f/101r/tl"><u>101r</u></a>).
        Rather than making a positive claim from repeated experience, the
        author-practitioner relates a single, specific instance—in this case, an
        unsuccessful trial of a difficult operation, which informs his
        subsequent modifications and may serve as an example to the reader. Once
        again, the term <em>experimenter</em> is used in a similar way. In his
        many musings on casting sands, the author-practitioner recommends a
        specific composition which “is excellent for casting in frames, and I
        have experienced [<em>experimenté</em>] it thus: I pestled the pieces
        which had come out of <em>noyau</em> molds in a mortar, dragging the
        pestle, because this sand is very soft…” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/118r/f/118r/tl"><u>118v</u></a>).
        What follows on the next page and a half is a detailed account of the
        specific steps—grinding, sifting, moistening, molding, firing—which led
        to a satisfactory outcome. Written in the past tense to record isolated
        instances of complex procedures gone right or wrong, such anecdotes do
        not purport to offer general insights but deal with the singular,
        specific, and perhaps surprising. Whether they were intended as records
        to aid the author-practitioner’s memory of his own experiences or as
        cautionary tales for readers, in recording particulars of experience,
        these accounts take an important place in the manuscript.</p>
    <h2 id="trying-and-testing">Trying and Testing</h2>
    <p>The language of experience was intimately connected with that of trying
        and testing. Thus far this language has been observed in particular by
        scholars of medical genres such as casebooks, recipe books, or
        <em>experimenta</em>. A brief survey of key terms in the most prominent
        contemporary dictionaries shows that the same holds true for the French
        vernacular across a variety of sources. As we saw above, contemporary
        definitions of <em>experience</em> included notions of trial, test, and
        proof as well as such terms as <em>essai</em> and <em>epreuve</em>. The
        verb <em>essayer</em> itself is associated with the idea of trialling
        (<em>eprouver</em>) in medieval French,<a href="#fn20"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref20"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> and in the <em>Dictionnaire du
            Moyen Français</em>, it ranges in meaning from trying food or drink
        before consumption and trying on clothes to more serious tests of
        quality, including for coin or minerals—what in contemporary and modern
        English would be called an “assay,” a borrowing from the French
        <em>essai</em>. Such tests could extend to workmen as well as their
        wares: guilds regulations from Poitou (the author-practitioner’s
        putative region of origin)<a href="#fn21"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref21"

        should practice as a barber unless he has been tried (<em>essayé</em>)
        and approved (<em>eprouvé</em>) by the masters.<a href="#fn22"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref22"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a> The word also conveyed a more
        general sense of experiencing something, without the notion of a
        specific trial. That sense of learning from experience predominates in
        Huguet’s dictionary of sixteenth-century French, attested by Montaigne,
        the master of the <em>essai</em>: “those who have occasion to negotiate
        with stubborn women may have experienced [<em>essayé</em>] into what
        rage one throws them…”<a href="#fn23"
           class="footnote-ref"

           role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a> He also uses the term in the
        sense of a person “being tried”: “I am in the grips of the worst of all
        maladies… I have already undergone [<em>essayé</em>] five or six of
        them,”<a href="#fn24"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref24"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a> and, elsewhere, “it marvelously
        tries [<em>essaye</em>] the sick person.”<a href="#fn25"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref25"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a> Finally, Montaigne also writes
        of “discourses which try [<em>essayent</em>] to show our close
        resemblance to animals,” attesting to the use of <em>essayer</em> in its
        most common modern sense of “to attempt.”<a href="#fn26"

           id="fnref26"

    <p>Conversely, the meanings of <em>esprouver</em> in the <em>Dictionnaire du
            Moyen Français</em> include performing an “assay” (<em>faire
            l’essai</em>), subjecting something or someone to an experiment with
        a view to verifying quality or truth as well as the outcome of such a
        trial, as in the etymologically related “to approve”
        (<em>approuver</em>).<a href="#fn27"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref27"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a> <em>Experimenter</em> has
        related meanings. In addition to experiencing something in the sense of
        living through it—such as Montaigne’s illness—it could signify learning
        through practice and by experience or putting to the test (<em>mettre à
            l’épreuve</em>). Another telling passage from the guild regulations
        of fifteenth-century Poitou states that no tailor should be allowed to
        set up shop until he had been <em>experimenté de tailler</em>—which we
        might translate, with Cotgrave, as “tried in tailoring.”<a href="#fn28"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref28"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a> Guild documents from Paris use
        similar language to regulate chandlers, who should be “tried

           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref29"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a> For humanists and artisans
        alike, the vernacular of experience was inextricably connected with that
        of trying and testing, and the meaning of individual terms slipped
        fluidly between passive experience and deliberate trial.</p>
    <p>It is no surprise, then, that similar patterns emerge in the experiential
        language used in Ms. Fr. 640. Even the word <em>experimenter</em>, which
        does most of its work in relating insights from repeated experience or
        singular events, is used on one occasion to describe a way of testing
        one’s materials. When salting artichokes, the author-practitioner
        advises, “take heed to test [<em>experimenter</em>] your brine with an
        egg, for if it is good &amp; strong enough, the egg will float on top.
        If not, it is not strong enough and would not preserve the fruits” (fol.
        <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/98v/f/98v/tl"><u>98v</u></a>).
        The strength of the pickling liquid is crucial to the outcome and
        requires a specific material test to verify. The manuscript is rife with
        testing procedures of this kind, involving an intervention by the
        practitioner specifically aimed at interrogating a process or a
        material.</p>
    <p>More usually, these tests are signalled by the verbs <em>essayer</em>,
        whose main meaning is “to try,” and <em>esprouver</em>, which is
        etymologically related to “proof,” carrying a slightly more specific
        sense of testing or assaying. As we shall see, however, the
        author-practitioner does not always make a clear distinction between
        them. On the subject of the blue pigment <em>azur d’esmail</em>—one of
        the author-practitioner’s favourites—he says that it “cannot be worked
        if it is too coarse. Try [<em>essaye</em>] it, therefore, on the
        fingernail or the oil palette” to make sure it is not too grainy (fol.
        <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/11r/f/11r/tl"><u>11r</u></a>).
        Elsewhere, he elaborates on expert assessment of azure before purchase:
        “to assay [<em>essayer</em>] it, painters bring their palette to the
        grocers, &amp; temper &amp; alloy it with a little white ground in oil,
        for in this way, the beautiful shows its turquine vivacity, but the bad
        is lavender grey” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/93v/f/93v/tl"><u>93v</u></a>).
        In a later entry on the same page, the author-practitioner recommends
        the same test for lake pigment, “which is also assayed
        [<em>s’esprouve</em>] on the palette with white” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/93v/f/93v/tl"><u>93v</u></a>).
        Describing a similar quality test for fermented cakes of woad or
        <em>pastel</em>, a blue dyestuff, the author-practitioner writes, “one
        assays [<em>espreuve</em>] it in the dyers’ vat” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/39r/f/39r/tl"><u>39r</u></a>);
        on the other hand, he describes the mandatory test shots for a new
        cannon as an <em>essay</em> (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/17r/f/17r/tl"><u>17r</u></a>).
        His use of the verbs <em>essayer</em> and <em>esprouver</em> for similar
        quality tests—and even for the same procedure in the case of
        <em>azur</em> and lake pigments—suggests that he thought of these terms
        as interchangeable when it came to testing.</p>
    <p>Both <em>essayer</em> and <em>esprouver</em> also appear in the context
        of testing or assaying in metalwork. One of the author-practitioner’s
        standard tests to determine the temperature of molten metal, for
        example, works by briefly dipping a small strip of paper into the melt.
        In the margin next to an entry on casting in molds made of cuttlefish
        bone, the author-practitioner notes that the alloy should be cooler than
        usual so as not to burn the bone: “test [<em>essaye</em>] for this
        effect with paper. If it turns the paper red, it is enough, it is good
        to cast, but if it blackens the paper, it is too hot” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/139r/f/139r/tl"><u>139r</u></a>).<a
           href="#fn30"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref30"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a> Elsewhere, on the other hand, he
        introduces a process for identifying a metal with the phrase “if you
        want to assay [<em>esprouver</em>] if it is tin or ☿ [i.e. mercury]”
        (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/92v/f/92v/tl"><u>92v</u></a>).
        Although likely an expert metalworker, the author-practitioner does not
        seem to reserve a clearly codified and demarcated language of testing or
        assaying metals.</p>
    <p>For specific tests aimed at verifying the properties of materials or the
        quality of a finished product, it seems that the author-practitioner
        does not make much of a distinction between <em>essayer</em> and
        <em>esprouver</em>. This is significant considering the connotations of
        these terms in their etymology and also later usage. For instance, given
        its etymological relationship with “proof,” one might expect
        <em>esprouver</em> to be used chiefly for official tests of saleable
        products; while the test for woad is indeed described using
        <em>esprouver</em>, the mandatory test shot of a cannon is referred to
        as <em>essay</em>. Nor do such tests evince a more stringent use of
        specific terms within areas of specialised expertise such as
        metalworking.</p>
    <p>Where the use of the term <em>essayer</em> does differ from
        <em>esprouver</em> is in descriptions of a slightly different sense of
        trying and testing. Whereas the kinds of tests discussed above have a
        known outcome which indicates the quality of a material or product, the
        manuscript also contains more open-ended injunctions to try for oneself.
        In fact, these represent the majority of instances of <em>essayer</em>.
        In the margin next to yet another entry discussing sand, for instance,
        the author-practitioner notes, perhaps at some point after the
        completion of the body of the entry, “try calcined vitriol” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/69r/f/69r/tl"><u>69r</u></a>).
        Occasionally, materials are suggested as alternatives—“try also mixing,
        in place of pebbles, pieces of colored glass or enamels” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/101r/f/101r/tl"><u>101r</u></a>)—or
        explicitly as substitutes for others, as is evident in a recipe for
        stucco: “Lacking plaster, you can mix in well ground chalk or ceruse,
        &amp; try bole &amp; similar things” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/29r/f/29r/tl"><u>29r</u></a>).
        As well as materials, the author-practitioner suggests alternative
        processes. Rather than laboriously carving molds for tin casting into
        stone, one might “try to etch with distilled vinegar” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/80v/f/80v/tl"><u>80v</u></a>),
        a suggestion that appears in a marginal note. In the very next marginal
        note, the author-practitioner continues his speculative line of
        thinking: “try calcined oyster shells. They are said to be excellent for
        molding” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/80v/f/80v/tl"><u>80v</u></a>),
        a suggestion based on hearsay which he had clearly not yet tried himself
        but found promising.</p>
    <p>Some injunctions to test things offer solutions to specific problems.
        When molding flowers, the author-practitioner describes how plants with
        very thin stalks often do not fully burn away during the firing of the
        mold because they do not have enough room—“try, therefore, to thicken
        the main stem with a little melted wax” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/127r/f/127r/tl"><u>127r</u></a>).
        In an entry on lifecasting animals, the suggested intervention—“try,
        having cast them in copper, to burnish them like gemstone foils, to see
        if they take color similarly” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/129r/f/129r/tl"><u>129v</u></a>)—seems
        to be motivated by a playful curiosity about the effect on the material.
        Whether they were intended as notes to himself or as calls to action for
        potential future readers, these invitations to try for oneself highlight
        the importance and open-endedness of experience as a way of
        understanding materials and processes.</p>
    <p>As well as raising questions, the language of trying and testing can also
        be used to present the results of trials and experience. From his
        extensive testing of materials for molding and casting, he reports “I
        have tried [<em>essayé</em>] four kinds of sand for lead &amp; tin:
        chalk, pestled glass, tripoli &amp; burnt linen, all 4 excellent” (fol.
        <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/68r/f/68r/tl"><u>68r</u></a>).
        Busting the myth of the allegedly unfading amaranth flower, he backs up
        his assertion that its colour can in fact be leached with white wine by
        noting “&amp; I have tested [<em>esprouve</em>] it” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/63r/f/63r/tl"><u>63r</u></a>).
        The recipe for an “excellent water against the plague of Monsieur
        Montorsin” is pronounced “a very rare &amp; tested [<em>esprouvé</em>]
        secret” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/44v/f/44v/tl"><u>44v</u></a>).
        Such endorsements in the language of testing are a common feature of
        records of practical knowledge. Householders keeping manuscript
        collections of medicinal and culinary recipes noted the success or
        failure of recipes in phrases such as “good,” or <em>probatum est</em>
        (“it is proven”), and authors of printed volumes used similar language
        to assure their readers that they were getting tried-and-tested
        information.</p>
    <p>The language of trying and testing, then, evokes the whole process of
        knowledge-making by experience, from chance observations to deliberate
        trials to injunctions for further experimentation to tried and tested
        methods. Although this hardly constitutes a fully-fledged experimental
        program, with specific experiential terms precisely matched to different
        stages or levels of confidence, the author-practitioner’s entry on
        “Experimented sands” affords a glimpse of a somewhat structured
        epistemic process of trying and recording. The opening sentence, “I have
        experimented with sand from Th{oulous}e…” is followed by a meandering
        but detailed account retracing the author-practitioner’s steps through
        one of his many experiences with sand molding (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/85v/f/85v/tl"><u>85v</u></a>).
        At the end of this anecdotal narrative, he draws his conclusions from
        this instance (and perhaps many others): switching to his italic
        handwriting usually reserved for headings, he writes and underlines “I
        find that…,” then summarises his general insights regarding the fineness
        of sand once more in his regular hand. A few lines down, a similar
        rubric in italic lettering reads “I believe that the secret…,” followed
        by his personal conjecture as to the secret of molding with sand—namely,
        to identify one sand that works well for each individual metal (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/86r/f/86r/tl"><u>86r</u></a>).
        The visual emphasis of the different script and underline highlight the
        author-practitioner’s thinking: he literally draws a line under his
        personal, contingent, and messy experience to draw general conclusions
        and map out future experiments with sands.</p>
    <p>While we should not over-interpret these few pages as anything like a
        rigorous research agenda, it vividly illustrates the significance of the
        author-practitioner’s language of experience. It encompasses specific
        tests which allow readers to ask directed questions of materials and
        products, probe their qualities, and assess whether they are suitable
        for the task at hand. It serves to formulate open questions and
        invitations to attempt experiments as yet untried; it also lends weight
        to assertions of tried-and-tested facts or remedies, illustrating a
        process during which materials and processes could change their
        epistemic status from whimsical idea to experiential insight.</p>
    <h2 id="from-experience-to-knowledge">From Experience to Knowledge</h2>
    <p>To understand the language of experience and testing in relation to the
        language of knowledge in a more general sense, it will be helpful to
        investigate the author-practitioner’s use of the word
        <em>cognoistre</em> (modern French <em>connaître</em>) and its
        derivatives, which can be translated as “to know” or “to recognize,”
        depending on context. With nearly seventy occurrences in the manuscript,
        it is key to the author-practitioner’s articulation of knowledge.</p>
    <p>As a noun, it often denotes general knowledge or mastery, for example of
        perspective in drawing, which relies on “having the knowledge
        [<em>cognoissance</em>] of the point” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/62r/f/62r/tl"><u>62r</u></a>).
        More specifically, it may refer to intimate knowledge of a material. To
        work successfully with different kinds of plaster, one “needs to know
        [<em>cognoistre</em>] the nature of each” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/125r/f/125r/tl"><u>125r</u></a>).
        In the margin of an entry describing a complex and dangerous recipe for
        a flux to make silver melt and run more easily, whose many ingredients
        include toxic arsenic, the author-practitioner notes that “goldsmiths
        who have knowledge [<em>cognoissance</em>] of this substance sell a
        <em>denier</em> of it for 5 <em>sous</em> to other goldsmiths” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/123r/f/123r/tl"><u>123r</u></a>).
        Imparting a similar trade secret, he notes that a copper alloy will cast
        better if one adds a little saltpeter into the melt, but he recommends
        that this be done “by folding your additions in a paper in order that
        everyone may not know [<em>cognoistre</em>] what you mix in” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/70r/f/70r/tl"><u>70r</u></a>).
        Used in this way, <em>cognoissance</em> encompasses the craftsman’s
        expertise in a general sense: as hard-won knowledge of difficult
        materials and processes, and also as a saleable commodity which might
        warrant protection through secrecy.</p>
    <p>As a verb, <em>cognoistre</em> often describes immediate recognition or
        insight in a very general sense. In two cases, it is even used for
        animals: a horse may be trained with sweet bread because it will come to
        know (<em>cognoistra</em>) its benefactor (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/54v/f/54v/tl"><u>54v</u></a>),
        and birds who have never known (<em>cogneu</em>) their father’s voice
        can be taught a human tune (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/98v/f/98v/tl"><u>98v</u></a>).
        Applied to the human senses, if often signals the recognition of
        straightforward clues. Small dogs used for retrieving birds from the
        water, for example, “are recognized [<em>se cognoissent</em>] by this,
        that they have a larger muzzle than others” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/98v/f/98v/tl"><u>98v</u></a>).
        Technical processes, too, yield such observable clues. When casting
        flowers, it is essential to ensure that the plant materials are
        completely burnt during the firing of the mold: “when you know
        [<em>cognois</em>] that the stem of a flower [...] is quite reduced to
        ashes, it is a sign that the rest is well burned” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/157r/f/157r/tl"><u>157r</u></a>).
        Reading the signs of materials also figures largely in the manuscript.
        Discussing cannon, the author-practitioner writes, “one recognizes
        [<em>cognoist</em>] the good alloy of a piece by seeing it. For if, with
        the greenness which they expel on the surface, they redden, that is to
        say that they are composed of a sufficient quantity of rosette” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/17r/f/17r/tl"><u>17r</u></a>).
        Interestingly, he goes on to say “if they themselves do not make this
        demonstration, scratch &amp; you will see,” suggesting that
        <em>cognoistre</em> in this case consists in recognising cues which the
        piece itself reveals to the naked (although no doubt trained) eye,
        without further intervention.</p>
    <p>If the material does not oblige, knowing it requires active probing, such
        as scratching the surface of the cannon. This, too, can be expressed by
        the verb <em>cognoistre</em>. The same entry states that old cannons are
        made of a characteristic alloy, and that “one recognises
        [<em>cognoist</em>] this composition with a burin,” by removing a small
        particle and thus assessing the consistency and colour of the metal
        (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/17v/f/17v/tl"><u>17v</u></a>).
        Likewise, to determine whether azure pigment painted in oil has fully
        dried, a specific test is necessary: “if you want to know
        [<em>cognoistre</em>] if it is dry, breathe on it and it will not shine”
        (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/59r/f/59r/tl"><u>59r</u></a>).
        These cases, where the properties of materials are not immediately
        “known” at a glance but only reveal themselves through intervention or
        manipulation on the practitioner’s part, resemble the material tests
        discussed above as one typical mode of testing denoted by
        <em>essayer</em> and <em>esprouver</em>.</p>
    <p>The relationship between testing and knowing is more obvious in instances
        where they occur in close proximity. Discussing the famous Toulousain
        dyestuff, the author-practitioner writes, “the goodness of the pastel
        woad is known [<em>se cognoist</em>] when, put in the mouth, it gives a
        taste as of vinegar, or when crumbling &amp; breaking it, it has some
        mold-like veins which are as if golden or silver. One assays
        [<em>espreuve</em>] it in the dyers’ vat” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/39r/f/39r/tl"><u>39r</u></a>).
        The initial assessment by immediate sensory experience, signalled by
        <em>cognoistre</em>, is followed by a more stringent testing procedure
        (<em>espreuve</em>) to determine how much fabric can be dyed with a
        given amount of woad. But <em>cognoissance</em> may also follow as the
        result of a contrived test. In an entry on varnish, we find the
        injunction to “test [<em>esprouve</em>] on a very clean knife, &amp; you
        will know [<em>cognoistras</em>] then if it has enough body” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/88r/f/88r/tl"><u>88r</u></a>).
        In an entry on sand for lead casting, which is praised as “the most
        excellent of all,” the author-practitioner provides a first-person
        narrative of his own successful completion of the procedure. Starting,
        “I took ceruse and crushed it dry on porphyry…” the anecdote relates all
        the steps which led to the perfect sand (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/84v/f/84v/tl"><u>84v</u></a>).
        Crucially, it also provides a clear example where the
        author-practitioner articulates the formation of insight from
        experience. When he heated the mold again to make a second cast, he
        writes, “my mold became hard like marble, and by this I knew [<em>ay
            cogneu</em>] that sands for molding high relief should be well
        moistened with some water, which gives them body &amp; compactness”
        (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/85r/f/85r/tl"><u>85r</u></a>).
        In other words, he points to a specific observation within an account of
        a single past experience to emphasise that he had “by this” (<em>par
            là</em>) a general insight about the way certain kinds of sand
        should be treated.</p>
    <p>The language of <em>cognoissance</em> denotes knowledge of materials and
        processes in a general sense, abstracted from individual experience, but
        it is also often used in a similar way and in close conjunction with
        accounts of testing or personal experience. This close and overlapping
        relationship between experience, testing or trying, and more general
        <em>knowing</em> speaks to the importance of experiential insights in
        the author-practitioner’s concept of knowledge.</p>
    <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The language of experience pervades the manuscript, and is clearly
        central to the author-practitioner’s ways of knowing. While his use of
        the terms under investigation evinces his commitment to experience, it
        also shows that the individual terms do not necessarily correspond to
        solidified categories of experience but are often used in an overlapping
        manner. <em>Experience</em> and <em>experimenter</em> are used to convey
        a general sense of experience as a “teacher,” both in the form of
        insights about how materials usually behave from years of repeated
        experience and in accounts of single, specific events which, although
        anecdotal, hold valuable particulars. The author-practitioner collects
        such insights from his own experience as well as that of others, without
        apparently making a value judgment based on the immediacy of the
        experience—a concern which would become central to later regimes of
        experiential knowledge-gathering, for example in the Royal Society’s
        emphasis on witnessing of experiments, including what has been termed
        “virtual witnessing” through written accounts employing a rhetoric of
        experiential immediacy.<a href="#fn31"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref31"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
    <p>There is also overlap with terms of trying and testing. While
        <em>essayer</em> and <em>esprouver</em> are consistently (if
        interchangeably) used for specific tests of materials and processes, on
        one occasion the author-practitioner tells readers to
        <em>experimenter</em> their artichoke brine. Interestingly, the verb
        <em>essayer</em> is distinct from <em>esprouver</em> in one sense: it
        alone is used for injunctions to try out alternative ingredients and new
        processes or just to see what would happen. It thus takes a special
        place in the author-practitioner’s language of experience as the word
        which opens up past experience to that of others, whether his potential
        readers or his future self, making his endeavor to learn from experience
        an open-ended one. In this, he fully recognises the epistemic power of
        collecting experience in writing, just as many early moderns did in
        their notebooks, recipe collections, and books of secrets. This opening
        up of his store of knowledge allows us to take seriously the closest
        thing we have to a kind of mission statement of his book: “from a desire
        to learn, [I] am exposing what little is in my workshop to receive,
        through a common commerce of letters, much rarer secrets from my
        benevolent readers” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/162r/f/162r/tl"><u>162r</u></a>).
    </p>
    <p>Finally, in the terms <em>cognoissance</em> and <em>cognoistre</em>, we
        find the author-practitioner articulating a more general concept of what
        “knowledge” means to him: acquired skill and mastery of materials and
        processes, but also the ability to “know” or “recognize,” at a glance,
        touch, or smell, the properties of things or the key stages in a
        process. This marks a potentially revealing distinction from the more
        invasive and specific material tests signalled by <em>essayer</em> or
        <em>esprouver</em>. One could <em>cognoistre</em> the composition of an
        alloy by its colour, or at a stretch by scratching it with a burin, but
        one would <em>essayer</em> or <em>esprouver</em> the quality of pigments
        or dyes by putting them through their paces on the painter’s palette or
        in the dyeing vat. It is tempting to see in this distinct use of
        language the root of the categorisation of experiential knowledge that
        subsequently came to characterise the New Science. Taking into account
        how much Francis Bacon’s program owed to the epistemic practices of
        craft workshops,<a href="#fn32"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref32"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a> it is very plausible that his
        distinction between the observation of nature in its normal course and
        the “trials and vexations” of experimental interrogation reflects
        distinct forms of experiential knowledge that were the bread and butter
        of early modern artisans.</p>
    <p>While a study of selected terms cannot lay claim to definite conclusions,
        it shows that experience was at the heart of the author-practitioner’s
        articulation of knowledge and how to get it. Although he does not always
        make fine-grained distinctions between his terms, the pervasive use of
        this language and its close relationship with his concept of
        <em>cognoissance</em> reveal a conscious use of experience as a source
        of knowledge, and a loose, eclectic, yet structured approach to
        experimentation.</p>
