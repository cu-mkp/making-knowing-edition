                of Ms. Fr. 640 requires <em>eau forte</em> (nitric acid) and
                “oil of sulfur” (sulfuric acid) as materials for teeth
                whitening. The recipe records the effects of both acids as well
                as their “side effects” and ways to counteract them. The
                organization of this recipe shows the author-practitioner was
                recording different approaches to whitening teeth rather than
                providing a tested remedy. The reconstruction of the recipe
                demonstrates the efficacy of the remedies, while the side
                effects would likely be revealed only after long term use.</p>

    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
    <p>Of the various medical recipes in Ms. Fr. 640, the two for whitening
        teeth, found on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/46r/f/46r/tl"><u>46r</u></a>
        and fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/47r/f/47r/tl"><u>47r</u></a>,
        allow us the opportunity not merely to reconstruct the medicinal
        substances but to test their efficacy as well. While the other medical
        entries would require living human subjects for such tests, the two
        tooth recipes can be evaluated by seeing their effects on non-living
        teeth. This, in turn, allows us to speculate about the
        author-practitioner’s relationship to the recipes he collected and the
        nature of the manuscript as a whole: was he simply recording a series
        approaches? Or was he providing effective remedies? Perhaps both?</p>
    <p>The two recipes in Ms. Fr. 640 show the use of various acid solutions in
        an early modern practice of tooth whitening. The recipe on fol. 46r
        requires aquafortis and “oil of sulfur,” which I identified as nitric
        acid and sulfuric acid, respectively. The other recipe on fol. 47r calls
        for sal ammoniac (ammonium chloride), alum (potassium aluminium sulfate)
        and rock salt. Even though the latter recipe contains no acid in the
        ingredients, both the solutions of ammonium chloride and potassium
        aluminium sulfate are acidic.<a href="#fn1"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref1"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> The recipe on fol. 46r also
        compares the different effects of aquafortis and “oil of sulfur” on
        teeth. Both recipes detail the side effects or deficiencies of the
        whitening preparations, and one provides a means to rectify these
        effects by using clove oil and rose honey.</p>
    <p>The author-practitioner thus recorded different approaches to whitening
        teeth. This allows me to reconstruct the efficacy of the remedies by
        designing an experiment to compare the formulas and to examine the
        reactions of the different substances when applied to teeth. Historical
        reconstruction of medical recipes in a modern chemistry lab generally
        has a limited ability to evaluate efficacy. The tooth-whitening recipe,
        however, provides a case through which the reaction of medical
        substances on human parts can be safely observed. This essay will focus
        on the reconstruction of the recipes on fol. 46r, the aim of which is,
        on the one hand, to uncover the rationale of using acid as dental
        treatment, and on the other, to compare the efficacy of different acid
        preparations for teeth whitening. Ultimately, exploring the efficacy of
        this recipe—as a medical recipe—may permit us to speculate about the
        author-practitioner’s relationship to medicine more broadly and to make
        comparisons between this type of entry and the non-medical ones
        contained in Ms. Fr. 640.</p>
    <h2 id="tooth-remedies-therapeutic-vs.-cosmetic">Tooth Remedies: Therapeutic
        vs. Cosmetic</h2>
    <p>The tooth-related recipes in Ms. Fr. 640 are primarily concerned with
        cosmetic rather than therapeutic effects.<a href="#fn2"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref2"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> Mary Lindemann argues the
        incidence of tooth decay was probably lower in early modern Europe than
        it is today; it did not become widespread until sugar was introduced as
        a sweetener in the late eighteenth century.<a href="#fn3"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref3"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> That said, teeth still decayed,
        and tooth pulling was considered one of the surgeon’s arts in the early
        modern period. Tooth-drawers or surgeon-dentists not only pulled teeth
        but also treated various tooth-related problems, most of which were
        toothaches. The analgesics used by early modern Italian tooth-drawers
        included oil of cloves, brandy, spirits of camphorated wine or camphor
        oil, guaiac oil, spirits of wine, opium extract, tobacco, Water of the
        Queen of Hungary (a decoction of rosemary flowers), spirit of vitriol,
        spirits of nitre, and anodyne drops (laudanum, volatile ammonium, oil,
        and aromatic salts).<a href="#fn4"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref4"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> Many of these substances are
        found among the ingredients in the tooth-whitening recipes in Ms. Fr.
        640. Clove oil was used in both recipes. The spirit of vitriol and
        spirits of nitre used by Italian tooth-drawers were similar or
        equivalent to the two main ingredients in the Ms. Fr. 640 recipes—the
        oil of sulfur and aquafortis. The similarity of ingredients suggests
        there was no clear boundary between cosmetic and therapeutic practice in
        the early modern period.</p>
    <p>The relationship between therapeutic and cosmetic ingredients built on
        competing views of how certain materials reacted with teeth. The
        remedies for tooth-drawers were not directly related to teeth <em>per
            se</em> but were understood according to humoral theory.<a

           role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> The tooth-whitening recipes in
        Ms. Fr. 640, as I will argue, suggest efficacy was related to the active
        properties of the materials—here, two kinds of acid.</p>
    <h2 id="aquafortis-and-oil-of-sulfur">Aquafortis and Oil of Sulfur</h2>
    <p><em>Eau forte</em> in French literally means “strong water,” which was
        also known by the Latin name <em>aqua fortis</em> in early modern
        artisanal texts.<a href="#fn6"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref6"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> It is a strong corrosive acid
        that contains primarily nitric acid. In the early modern period,
        aquafortis was conventionally made by distilling nitre (saltpeter) with
        vitriol or oil of vitriol. Alchemists developed variant recipes with
        additional or substitute materials, such as sulfur and alum.<a
           href="#fn7"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref7"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> A more concentrated solution of
        it was known as “spirit of nitre.”<a href="#fn8"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref8"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> Eleven recipes in Ms. Fr. 640
        call for aquafortis (see Appendix); its use extends to metalwork,
        casting, embellishing and therapeutics, as well as to the killing of
        animals. It can eat through most metals except gold, which makes it a
        commonly used acid in several kinds of metalwork, especially etching and
        preparing pure gold. The author-practitioner was aware of its potency.
        He recorded one recipe on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/109v/f/109v/tl"><u>109v</u></a>
        that used one drop of aquafortis to kill a snake for lifecasting.</p>
    <p>Oil of sulfur is another strong acid used widely in Ms. Fr. 640. A group
        of nine “oil of sulfur” recipes are found across fols. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/46r/f/46r/tl"><u>46r</u></a>–<a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/46v/f/46v/tl"><u>46v</u></a>
        (in fact, only one recipe on these folios does not concern oil of
        sulfur). The “oil” was used both in therapeutic remedies and as a
        material for writers and shoemakers. Oil of sulfur was a highly valued
        substance in early modern alchemy, where it was also known as “spirit of
        sulfur.” It was related to another substance, oil (spirit) of vitriol;
        both of these “oils” we now understand to be sulfuric acid. Each was
        prepared through distillation. The original mineral (sulfur and vitriol,
        respectively) was heated until it vaporized and then was collected in a
        distillation apparatus, where it was converted to liquid form.<a
           href="#fn9"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref9"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> Conventionally, oil of sulfur was
        more valuable than oil of vitriol, likely due to the primacy of sulfur
        in alchemy. However, by the seventeenth century, alchemists began to
        realize that oil of sulfur and oil of vitriol were, in fact, the same
        substance.</p>
    <p>Although aquafortis and oil of sulfur were considered strong acids, their
        applications are distinct in Ms. Fr. 640. Aquafortis is primarily
        associated with metalwork, while oil of sulfur plays a central role in
        specialty ink-making and shoemaking as well as in medicine. The
        corrosive nature of both was noted in the recipes in Ms. Fr. 640:
        aquafortis was applied in etching metals and snail shells, while oil of
        sulfur could eliminate inks and corrode paper, parchment, and leathers.
        These well-known corrosive properties likely motivated the use of the
        acids in eliminating blackness and stains on the surface of teeth. Yet
        their potency required careful application either in limited doses or in
        mixtures containing clove oil and rose honey to diminish the deleterious
        effects on teeth.</p>
    <h2 id="reconstruction">Reconstruction</h2>
    <p>In reconstructing the recipe on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/46r/f/46r/tl"><u>46r</u></a>,
        I encountered problems with the teeth themselves, the concentration of
        the acids, and the ambiguity of measurements given in the text.<a
           href="#fn10"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref10"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> First, I cannot replicate the
        tooth afflictions of early modern people. It is also impossible to
        imitate the tartar buildup or blackness of early modern teeth, since
        these varied according to diet and eating habits. I was fortunate to
        acquire several deciduous (baby) teeth from a male donor who was born in
        1996. The teeth had been kept for more than a decade. Both the nature of
        baby teeth and their state of preservation make drawing conclusions from
        the reconstruction challenging. Accepting that reconstruction involves
        compromise, I decided to soak the modern baby teeth in black tea for two
        days in order to stain them; this would make it easier to observe any
        change in color due to the treatments described in the manuscript.</p>
    <p>The second major challenge was that the concentration of the acids is
        neither specified in the recipe nor identified in any other
        contemporaneous texts. Early modern artisans did not specify the
        concentration of acid solutions as we do today.<a href="#fn11"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref11"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> A previous Making and Knowing
        research essay on “oil of sulfur” as a writing material used both low
        and high concentrations of sulfuric acid.<a href="#fn12"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref12"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> In my own reconstruction, I used
        a 65% nitric acid solution and a 15% sulfuric acid solution. I made this
        decision on the assumption that the aquafortis, a substance used mainly
        in metalwork and thus likely more corrosive, would be more concentrated
        than the sulfuric acid. Furthermore, as the recipe calling for
        aquafortis warns that it could have the side effect of ultimately
        blackening the teeth, I took that to indicate a stronger acid than in
        the recipe calling for sulfuric acid.</p>
    <p>The third issue concerned the measurements in the recipe, which include
        “drops” and “a nutshell.” They are thus more approximate than exact. I
        decided to use a glass dropper to measure the drops, and I defined “a
        nutshell” as 10 ml.</p>
    <p>In order to make a full comparison between the reactions of different
        acid preparations with teeth, I designed six groups:</p>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>65% Nitric acid</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Group one: apply nitric acid once without rinsing with water.
                </p>
            </blockquote>
        </li>
        <li>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Group two: apply nitric acid; rinse with water after ten
                    minutes; repeat three times.</p>
            </blockquote>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>15% Sulfuric acid</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Group one: apply sulfuric acid once without rinsing with
                    water.</p>
            </blockquote>
        </li>
        <li>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Group two: apply sulfuric acid; rinse with water after ten
                    minutes; repeat three times.</p>
            </blockquote>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>Mixture of 10 ml clove oil, 10 ml honey
        and 8 drops of 15% sulfuric acid</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Apply the mixture; rinse with water after ten minutes; repeat
                    three times.</p>
            </blockquote>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>Water control group</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Rinse with water three times.</p>
            </blockquote>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>Two of the six experiments above
        correspond to the instructions in the recipe itself: “Nitric acid Group
        two” and the “Mixture” group. As the recipes recommend clove oil and
        honey to correct the corrosive nature of sulfuric acid, it became
        necessary to observe the reaction of sulfuric acid on its own. The
        standard process I developed included three repeated cycles of
        application and rinsing, but I was also curious to see what would happen
        if the respective acids were left on the teeth without any water rinse.
        An additional control group using just water seemed indispensable to
        demonstrate the stains were eliminated by the acids rather than simply
        washed away by the liquid (<i><u>Fig. 1</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 2</u></i>).

    <p>The experiment showed 65% nitric acid was the most effective for teeth
        whitening. Most of the tea stains were cleaned after applying and
        rinsing three times. The 15% sulfuric acid and the “mixture” worked
        similarly: both removed most of the tea stains while leaving small
        stains. Unsurprisingly, the water did not eliminate any stains. After
        soaking for two weeks, the teeth in Group One of both nitric acid and
        sulfuric acid appeared to have some degree of corrosion. The teeth in
        the other groups, however, remained similar to their prior state (<i><u>Fig. 3</u></i>).</p>

    <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>This reconstruction demonstrates the efficacy of nitric acid and sulfuric
        acid in whitening teeth. The “side effects” mentioned in the recipe
        (being corrosive and turning teeth black), however, did not emerge
        during my experiment. The teeth in the two nitric acid groups showed no
        sign of blackening. Sulfuric acid is corrosive, but simply adding a
        rinsing process seems to have diminished the effect. These results
        appear to contradict the statements in the recipe. Nonetheless, since
        the remedy was supposed to be used regularly, the side effects of
        blackening and corrosion might only appear after long-term, repeated
        application. This reconstruction is still far from a well designed,
        scientific experiment. There are numerous variables that could have
        affected the final results. At this stage, however, the reconstruction
        shows both nitric and sulfuric acids to be effective materials for
        cleaning teeth. Their reported side effects, however, still need to be
        demonstrated by a long-term application of the remedy, which is beyond
        the scope of the current reconstruction.</p>
    <p>While the efficacy of the recipes in whitening the teeth could suggest
        the author-practitioner included medical recipes known to work, our
        uncertainty surrounding his claims about the side effects make it
        difficult to determine whether he was providing a remedy or recording
        different approaches. Further research may help resolve that question.
        Simply having medical recipes whose efficacy can be tested, however,
        allows us a means of bringing this type of entry into conversation with
        other categories of recipe found in Ms. Fr. 640.</p>
