        <div>
            <p>This essay investigates the significance of sulfur in Ms. Fr.
                640, by exploring contemporary artisanal writings and by
                reconstructing the process of casting in sulfur and wax, using
                different additives found on fols. <a
                   href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/12r/f/12r/tl"><u>12r</u></a>
                and <a
                   href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/140v/f/140v/tl"><u>140v</u></a>.
                While casting in sulfur may seem unusual to modern eyes, our
                experiments show that sulfur, especially in combination with
                additives such as soot black and “sanguine,” yields results
                which live up to the author-practitioner’s emphasis on hard,
                long-lasting and detail-rich casts. Furthermore, they shed light
                on the author-practitioner’s preoccupation with bubble-like
                impurities forming in the cast. While Ms. Fr. 640 contains no
                theorizing about sulfur as alchemical prime matter, we suggest
                that the material was a metaphor for the process of
                experimentation itself.</p>

    <p>From the number of references in BnF Ms. Fr. 640 and contemporary
        sources, sulfur appears to have been a versatile material in early
        modern fabrication processes. The manuscript refers several times to
        sulfur as a material for casting, and this essay will focus on these
        recipes. Our primary question is why, and under what circumstances,
        sulfur would be an advantageous material to use for pouring and molding.
        Our method of inquiry in addressing this question is to examine the
        material properties of sulfur itself when melted and poured into molds,
        as well as to follow the manuscript’s directions for additives to sulfur
        in order to test their effects on the casting process. In addition to
        our questions regarding why and when sulfur would have been used for
        casting, and what sulfur would be mixed with and why, these experiments
        and this research aims to address whether the material of sulfur itself
        carried any semiotic meaning for the author-practitioner of Ms. Fr. 640,
        and whether the material properties of sulfur (e.g., flammability and
        brittleness) are significant in the author-practitioner’s descriptions
        or directions. This research essay begins by reading closely some of the
        directions that the manuscript gives for casting in sulfur. It then
        proceeds to describe the series of experiments we performed, to discuss
        the textual sources in combination with experimental findings, and to
        conclude with suggestions for further research.<a href="#fn1"

           id="fnref1"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> To answer our questions, we will
        focus on two recipes that explicitly discuss casting in sulfur: fol. <a

        Text of the Recipes
    </h2>
    <p>The recipe “For casting in sulfur” on fol. 140v emphasises neatness
        (<em>net, nettement</em>), suggesting that obtaining a smooth surface in
        molding and casting was a significant criterion of success. This is
        further illustrated by a marginal note which reads “try sulfur passed
        through melted wax, because it no longer inflames &amp; no longer makes
        eyelets.” The phrase “passed through” is unclear, but could mean melting
        the wax first and adding the solid sulfur subsequently, since the recipe
        seems to emphasize that the wax is already melted. The “eyelets”
        mentioned here may refer to air bubbles that form within the heated
        material, which can damage an otherwise well-poured cast, hence
        affecting its smooth surface.<a href="#fn2"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref2"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> Another criterion is that the
        cast object may be easily removed from the mold, which may also be one
        of the connotations of the author-practitioner’s use of the word
        <em>net</em>.<a href="#fn3"
           class="footnote-ref"

    <p>“For molding sulfur” [<em>Pour mouler de soufre</em>] on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/12r/f/12r/tl"><u>12r</u></a>
        includes similar emphasis on casting “very neatly” avoiding “pustules
        &amp; bubbles”—notably, one should not “cast in wind &amp; in cold, for
        it would become porous.” Sulfur is improved by mixing in “soot black” or
        “pulverized sanguine,” which makes it “harder and stronger.” As
        described in Cennino Cennini’s <em>The Craftsman’s Handbook</em>, “soot
        black” is the soot collected from a lamp burning linseed oil.<a
           href="#fn4"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref4"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> Cennini also provides an
        explanation of “sanguine”: “mark out all the outlines with dark sinoper
        and a little black, tempered; and this will be called ‘sanguine.’”<a
           href="#fn5"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref5"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> What Cennini means by “dark
        sinoper” is not entirely clear. In fact, Cennini’s translator uses the
        term as an example of a word with a diffuse meaning which is difficult
        to translate: “in other cases, such as his [Cennini’s term]
        <em>sinopia</em>, the meaning is too general to be reduced to any single
        commercial term.”<a href="#fn6"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref6"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> Vannoccio Biringuccio mentions a
        similar mixture of sulfur and red powder: “when I did not have plaster
        of Paris, I have used sulfur and brick dust.”<a href="#fn7"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref7"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> Cennini, too, recommends casting
        with sulfur, using clay or plaster molds: “if you wish to cast medals…,
        melt some sulfur; get it cast in these molds, and it will be done.”<a
           href="#fn8"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref8"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> The suggestion that mixing sulfur
        with these pigments would it “harder and more resistant” or “tougher and
        stronger” implies that, since sulfur itself is quite brittle and chips
        or cracks easily, hardening the pigments might have enhanced their
        durability, and thus their usefulness.</p>
    <p>The marginal note on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/12r/f/12r/tl"><u>12r</u></a>
        contains several interesting modifications to the main recipe. In
        particular, two other sets of terms, besides the “eyelets” from fol.
        140v, are used to caution against air bubbles: “pustules &amp; bubbles,”
        (<em>pustules &amp; bouillons</em>) and the verb <em>souffler</em> which
        here means to “become porous.” The author-practitioner’s use of three
        different terms for bubble-like imperfections, each with slightly
        different connotations, speaks to a material awareness of the process
        which is not immediately clear to the modern reader.</p>
    <h2 id="experiments">Experiments</h2>
    <p>In order to test some of our hypotheses and to decipher some of the more
        cryptic language in the two recipes from Ms. Fr. 640, we first focused
        our experiments on casting pure sulfur into bread, as suggested on fol.
        140v. Later, in order to save time, we used a standardized silicone
        baking mold. Then we moved on to casting sulfur with some of the
        pigments added, as suggested on fol. 12r, and to casting sulfur in
        combination with wax, as in fol. 140v. For our first experiment, using
        bread as a molding material, we patiently grew a rye yeast starter,
        which eventually yielded a dark and dense rye bread.<a href="#fn9"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref9"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> After removing the bread from the
        oven, we scooped the pith of the bread out from the crust with a spoon
        while the bread was still hot, and pressed it in two big pieces around
        the sides (front and back) of a small Buddha figurine. When dry, this
        was our pattern for molding (<i><u>Fig. 1</u></i>).<a href="#fn10"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref10"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> We pierced the bread with two
        wooden lead pencils as indications of how to register the two sides of
        the mold with respect to one another, and we cut a gate into which the
        molten casting material could be poured. The 99.9% pure sulfur that we
        used came as a bright yellow powder. The material’s melting point is
        about 240°F, and it took around thirty minutes to solidify inside our
        bread mold (<i><u>Fig. 2</u></i>). The result of our pour was a highly
        detailed, three-dimensional reproduction of the figurine, reproducing
        more of the surface detail of the original than the bread mold appeared
        to have captured, as detail in the uniformly dark color of the bread is
        difficult to see (<i><u>Fig. 3</u></i>). The success of this experiment
        informed our subsequent trials. Because this was a two-sided mold, no
        surface of the sulfur was exposed to air, which seems to have guaranteed
        the relatively smooth surface; in the one-sided bread molds created by
        other members of our group, the crystals of the sulfur became quite
        visible as the sulfur cooled.</p>

    <p>The cast of the Buddha figurine demonstrated that pure sulfur melts
        easily, pours well, and picks up very detailed impressions of molds.
        Other pours of pure sulfur executed by the rest of the group
        corroborated the results of this experiment. Our next trials involved
        mixing sulfur with soot black in varying amounts.<a href="#fn11"

           id="fnref12"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> We also experimented with the
        order of steps in the process: melting the sulfur and adding the pigment
        afterward, mixing them as powders and melting them together, and melting
        them separately and mixing them afterward (<i><u>Fig. 4</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 5</u></i>).<a href="#fn13"

        turned the mixture a rich, dark black color (<i><u>Fig. 6</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 7</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 8</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 9</u></i>). A
        smaller amount of soot black added to the same amount of sulfur still
        gave the melted mixture a dark black color, but when it hardened the
        difference became apparent: the first mixture with the larger amount of
        black turned dark gray, whereas the smaller amount made the casts turn a
        greenish color (<i><u>Fig. 10</u></i>). The color of all mixtures
        lightened over time. When we first poured them, all the casts looked
        much darker than they became after they completely solidified (<i><u>Vid. 1</u></i>).</p>

                becoming lighter in color over time. The mixture of the three
                casts on the left is 11.5 g sulfur to two tiny spoons (using the
                spoon seen in Fig. 5) of soot black; the mixture for the three
                on the right is the same but half the amount of soot black. The

    <p>Our other experiments with pigments were much less successful. For
        “sanguine” we mixed a Venetian red pigment (also from Kremer Pigments,
        used for our “sinoper”) with a very small amount of lamp black, as per
        Cennini’s instructions (<i><u>Fig. 11</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 12</u></i>).
        When combined with the sulfur, the powders appeared to form a
        homogeneous mix, but after we poured the mixture, the materials visibly
        separated from one another, so that the poured cast was dappled yellow
        and red (<i><u>Fig. 13</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 14</u></i>).</p>

    <p> We began our experiments with sulfur and wax with similar doubts about
        how well the materials would mix, because in earlier trials with bread
        molding, other group members found the ingredients did not combine well.
        The line from fol. 140v, “try sulfur passed through melted wax” could,
        once again, imply a number of procedures, and we attempted several:
        melting wax then adding powdered sulfur, melting wax then adding solid
        sulfur (in chunks), and melting each separately and combining them. The
        different forms of the sulfur appeared not to affect the results of
        these experiments. When sulfur, in either a solid or molten liquid
        state, was combined with wax, the two materials remained visibly
        separate, reminiscent of oil added to water (<i><u>Fig. 15</u></i>).</p>

    <p>For carrying out these experiments another recipe from the manuscript was
        useful, “Wax for molding” on fol. 109r, in particular the phrase “and
        with the sulfur going to the bottom…,” since this implies precisely that
        the sulfur and the wax do <em>not</em> mix or fuse. Instead, the sulfur
        turned a reddish color at the bottom of the liquid wax. We now felt we
        understood that this is what the author-practitioner meant in reporting
        that the sulfur should be “passed through” the wax. The results of these
        pours in which we passed the sulfur through the wax were very smooth,
        milky, homogeneous surfaces, with a large amount of detail. They had all
        the definition of sulfur casts but appeared less brittle, and they also
        contained all the malleability of wax, without its translucency (a
        characteristic that makes it difficult to see detail on wax impressions
        and therefore makes them more challenging to work with (<i><u>Fig. 16</u></i>). Furthermore, the back sides of these sulfur-wax
        casts did not crystallize visibly in the way that pure sulfur or sulfur
        mixed with pigments did; instead, the back surface that was exposed to
        the air was as smooth as the front (<i><u>Fig. 17</u></i>). Our final
        experiment with sulfur and wax was to melt one of these mixtures back to
        a liquid state. As predicted, they gradually re-separated (<i><u>Fig. 18</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 19</u></i>).</p>

                combining wax and sulfur the two materials remained largely
                separate, and therefore each pour has a slightly varying ratio
                of the two materials. All of them appeared to be mostly composed
                of wax (with sulfur remaining at the bottom of the melting pot).
                All of our trials began with the same amount (by weight) of wax
                and sulfur. From right to left, these four casts are: pure wax;
                a first pour (mostly wax); a second pour (a slightly larger
                amount of sulfur); and pure sulfur. Note the harsh luster of the
                pure sulfur and the translucency of the wax. The two “medals” in

    <p>Further experiments involving sulfur and its additives would include a
        study of and experiments with all of the recipes that mention sulfur in
        the manuscript, although that may be difficult to achieve. The most
        common combinations, aside from sulfur with wax, include the addition of
        metal filings (copper and iron), tin, ammonia salt, resin, and
        verdigris. Additionally, further trials with other pigments for
        “sanguine” besides the Venetian red pigment that we used would help to
        determine the author-practitioner’s meaning in that suggestion. Along
        similar lines, the proportions of the various materials could be
        explored in more depth; we only had time to test proportions within a
        relatively small range. Further philological or hermeneutic research
        into the author-practitioner’s use of language might also help to
        determine the actual ends of casting in sulfur, and why making the
        material “harder and stronger” was a valuable goal. Additionally, while
        empirical observations seemed to corroborate the author-practitioner’s
        comments about the hardness and brittleness of the various mixtures,
        more accurate testing with appropriate instruments would provide
        interesting insight.</p>
    <p>While very few positive conclusions can be drawn from either these
        experiments or the text of the recipes, we can say with certainty that
        sulfur was used as a casting material for good reason, since its
        capacity for accepting detail proved excellent in almost all
        experiments. Whatever alchemical associations the material carried for
        others—Biringuccio mentions these properties and practitioners
        skeptically<a href="#fn14"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref14"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a>—few traces of those ideas are
        evident in the recipes from Ms. Fr. 640 that we studied. Instead, sulfur
        is used quite practically, and when its deficiencies as a material (its
        color, luster, or brittleness) make it inappropriate for certain tasks,
        the author suggests augmenting it with other materials. That sulfur is
        also used in so many other ways, including as an ingredient in pigments
        and in a variety of other recipes, attests not only to the material’s
        availability and versatility, but perhaps more significantly, to its
        <em>perceived</em> versatility.<a href="#fn15"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref15"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> For all of the different uses
        documented, one can infer that others were tried but did not produce the
        desired result. Therefore it may not be too speculative to suggest that
        sulfur metonymically represents the process of trying and assaying, or
        in other words, of “experimenting” itself. The prevalence of sulfur in
        recipes ranging from coloring to casting to “boiling an egg in cold
        water without fire” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/35r/f/35r/tl"><u>35r</u></a>)
        provides evidence that the material was both commonly used and tried in
        a breadth of applications. Even in its uses in casting explored here,
        one of its purposes was likely to experiment with the level of detail
        one can achieve with a carved pattern or mold.<a href="#fn16"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref16"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> It would seem that, in its
        ubiquity in trying and testing in this manuscript, sulfur both connoted
        the idea of experimentation and, as a versatile material, invited
        further actual trials.</p>
    <p>Although sulfur, along with mercury and sometimes salt, was considered by
        alchemical writers to be one of the “principles” of all metals, and is
        therefore ubiquitous in discussions of that subject, such ideas are not
        explicitly discussed in Ms. Fr. 640.<a href="#fn17"

           role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> Whatever the
        author-practitioner’s relationship to alchemy was, our research and
        experimentation has demonstrated that the claims made in regard to
        casting sulfur in Ms. Fr. 640 <em>are</em> repeatable. Addressing the
        reproducibility of alchemical practices would be beyond the scope of the
        present study, but we have been able to conclude that the
        author-practitioner provides practical—and practicable—advice on
        procedures for casting using sulfur.</p>
    <p>Our research has only been able to raise the question as to whether the
        author-practitioner omitted mentioning sulfur’s applications to
        alchemical processes simply because those uses were so widespread as to
        be common knowledge, or whether these omissions constitute evidence of a
        more deliberate disinterest in chrysopoetic alchemy (as displayed by
        Biringuccio). Further research would be necessary to determine what
        allusions to alchemy exist in the manuscript. Nonetheless, based on the
        number and variety of recipes that suggest using sulfur (and,
        presumably, others that were not included) our work with sulfur allows
        us to conclude that the author-practitioner’s methods were not only
        predicated on experimentation, but that for him sulfur seemed
        metonymically to stand for the process of experimentation.</p>

                <p>Biringuccio writes on the uses of sulfur for casting and more
                    broadly: “as I told you, sulfur melts and by means of its
                    fusion one can mold any desired object from it as if it were
                    plaster of Paris, wax, or melted metal. It serves human
                    needs in medicine, in the purifying and bleaching of wool,
                    and in divers other things. But the greatest quantity today
                    is consumed in making gunpowder.” See Vannoccio Biringuccio,

                <p>“There is another black which is made in this manner: take a
                    lamp full of linseed oil, and fill the lamp with this oil,
                    and light the lamp. Then put it, so lighted, underneath a
                    good clean baking dish, and have the little flame of the
                    lamp come about to the bottom of the dish, two or three
                    fingers away, and the smoke which comes out of the flame
                    will strike on the bottom of the dish, and condense in as
                    mass. Wait a while; take the baking dish, and with some
                    implement sweep this color, that is, soot, off on to a
                    paper, or into some dish; and it does not have to be worked
                    up or ground, for it is a very fine color.” Cennino d’Andrea

                    relevant is the “black sulfured wax” recommended on fol.
                    139v. Cellini also mentions using “black wax”: “to see
                    better how you are getting on, you may occasionally press in
                    a little black wax, or whatever colour pleases you better,
                    to gauge the projections.” See <em>The Treatises</em>, 65.
                    Cellini does not describe how to make “black wax,” but the
                    recipe “Casting Wax to mold an animal that one has not got,”
                    Ms. Fr. 640, fol. 139v, includes a definition of black wax

                <p>On pp. 86–87 of <em>The Pirotechnia</em>, Biringuccio doubts
                    that sulfur is a “principle” for metals, as the alchemists
                    argued, “because I do not believe that either of these
                    [mercury or sulfur] really occurs except in similar
                    elemental substances. I say this because I have never seen
                    sulfur found in any metal mine, or metal near any sulfur or
                    mercury ore,” yet he proceeds, “the alchemists hold sulfur
                    in great reverence as a material agent in all their
                    operations because of its heat and dryness and because of
                    its yellow color.” He then describes silk workers’ use of
                    the material for bleaching and women’s use of it as a hair
                    dye. See <em>The Pirotechnia</em>, 90.<a href="#fnref14"
