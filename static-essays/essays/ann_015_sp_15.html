    <h2 id="metamorphosis">Metamorphosis</h2>
    <p>Knowledge about coral and its properties in early modern Europe was the
        outcome of a long cultural sedimentation of different traditions. One
        component was a core of literary texts transmitted among the learned,
        including physicians, artists, humanists, and naturalists. The most
        important source was Ovid’s <em>Metamorphoses</em>, written in the first
        decade CE. The poem recounted the origins of coral as the result of a
        dramatic transformation in a compelling mythological framework: When
        Perseus laid the severed head of Medusa on the edge of the sea, some
        seaborne sticks came in contact with the Gorgon’s bleeding head and were
        soon turned into stone, thus coral was born. Ovid’s poem was
        exceptionally popular through the centuries, laying the foundation for a
        persistent tradition that was incorporated into Pliny’s <em>Natural
            History.</em> This encyclopedic work, written only seventy years
        after Ovid’s <em>Metamorphoses</em>, was an influential source to which,
        even after many centuries, early modern European scholars continued to
        refer. When discussing coral, Pliny stated that it was also named
        Gorgonia, as its original soft material had turned into the hardness of
        stone, intertwining the myth of Medusa with the stony nature of coral.
    </p>
    <h2 id="new-questions">New Questions</h2>
    <p>Over the course of the sixteenth century, some of this information began
        to be questioned. Pietro Andrea Matthioli argued in 1563 that the
        berries of coral mentioned by Pliny were nothing other than the polished
        beads made by artisans.<a href="#fn1"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref1"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> However, the idea of the
        transformative nature of coral, which turned from a soft material into a
        hard one when removed from water, persisted, conceivably due to the lack
        of any direct knowledge of its condition under the sea. Significantly,
        one of the first texts questioning that information relied on the
        evidence from coral hunters: Daniello Bartoli in his treatise on
        coagulation, dated 1681, refers to an entrepreneur in the coral hunt who
        ascertained that coral was hard even under the sea.<a href="#fn2"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref2"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> Nevertheless Bartoli still
        accepted a hardening process taking place in the reproductive season,
        which demonstrates the resilience of such a belief and the challenge in
        meshing new evidence with traditional frameworks.<a href="#fn3"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref3"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> Another early empirical challenge
        to the textual tradition can be traced in the 1609 <em>Gemmarum et
            Lapidum Historia</em> by Anselmus de&nbsp;Boodt. When discussing the
        nature of coral, he refers to a specific branch examined in the
        antiquarium of Rudolf II, which apparently showed both a vegetal part
        and a mineral one.<a href="#fn4"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref4"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> On such evidence, he rejected the
        common belief of coral turning into stone outside seawater and proposes
        a theory based on a “stonifying sap” of coral (<em>succus
            lapidescens</em>). This stonifying sap would gradually turn the
        vegetal plant of coral into stone. The Nuremberg goldsmith Wenzel
        Jamnitzer’s use of coral in his portrayal of Ovid’s myth of the nymph
        Daphne transforming into a laurel tree alludes to these views of the
        transformative nature of coral (<i><u>Fig. 1</u></i>).</p>

    <p>In their efforts to organize the complexity of nature in a taxonomical
        structure, early modern naturalists placed coral halfway between the
        vegetal and mineral spheres. Ferrante Imperato placed coral after stones
        but before mushrooms and plants. His definition of coral, similar to
        De&nbsp;Boodt’s, described a leafless bush made of a “stony substance”
        (<em>sostanza pietrigna</em>) that could grow as a plant both on rocks
        and on other shrubs by covering their branches “like a dressing” (<em>in
            modo di veste</em>).<a href="#fn5"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref5"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> This is why, he reports, when
        coral accidentally snaps, we can occasionally see an inner core of wood
        (<em>si scopre l’interno legnoso</em>).<a href="#fn6"

        branch of imitation coral, as his description coincides precisely with
        the appearance of the imitation coral produced following the recipe in
        Ms. Fr. 640 for “Counterfeit coral” on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/3r/f/3r/tl"><u>3r</u></a>.
    </p>
    <p>Our contemporary knowledge of coral differs from both Imperato’s and
        de&nbsp;Boodt’s observations. Coral does not have an internal ligneous
        structure or any vegetal components at all. Unfortunately, it is
        impossible to trace extant objects to which those naturalists referred,
        however, in the absence of additional evidence, it is fair to speculate
        about whether they were examining natural or artificial coral.</p>
    <h2 id="recipes-for-imitating-coral">Recipes for Imitating Coral</h2>
    <p>The practice of producing imitation coral appears to have been common,
        and several recipes for imitation coral from the sixteenth to the early
        eighteenth century have been identified.<a href="#fn7"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref7"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> These recipes fall into three
        types (some authors provide more than one recipe): the first type is the
        most common and consists of a moldable paste that is pressed into molds
        and dried. The paste was a combination of horn powder mixed with ashes
        and water, with cinnabar added as a red pigmenting agent. This first
        type was apparently the most appropriate for paternoster beads.<a
           href="#fn8"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref8"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
    <p>A second type of recipe involved the use of fragments of natural coral.
        Coral was crushed into a fine powder and left in a solution of lemon or
        orange juice, mixed with a coloring agent such as cinnabar, minium, or
        sinoper, and kept under a layer of horse droppings for a number of days.
        The paste thus obtained was left to dry. This recipe, as mentioned by
        Giovanni Battista della&nbsp;Porta, produced material very similar to
        natural coral, and it was recommended for making small objects like cups
        but also for repairing broken coral.<a href="#fn9"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref9"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> De&nbsp;Boodt also mentions this
        second method as used by forgers who expressly wanted to imitate the
        properties and powers of coral. On the other hand, he writes, other
        forgers were interested instead in imitating the shape and color of
        coral.<a href="#fn10"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref10"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
    <p>This brings us to the third type of recipe for imitation coral: the
        recipe on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/3r/f/3r/tl"><u>3r</u></a>
        of Ms. Fr. 640. This recipe is quite detailed as to materials and
        technique:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>One needs to first make the branches of wood or take a bizarre thorn
            branch, then melt a lb of the most beautiful clear pitch resin and
            put in one ounce of subtly ground vermilion with walnut oil, and if
            you add in a little Venice laque platte, the color will be more
            vivid, and stir everything in the resin melted over a charcoal fire
            and not of flame, for fear that it catches fire. Next dip in your
            branches while turning, &amp; if any filaments should remain on it,
            turn the branch over the heat of the charcoal.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>This method (see <i><u>Vid. 1</u></i>)
        does not appear in other sixteenth-century sources, so far as we could
        determine.<a href="#fn11"

    <p>A recipe mentioned by Anselmus De&nbsp;Boodt and its short copy by Thomas
        Nicols mentions the use of a twig of a wild pear tree.<a href="#fn12"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref12"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> Once cleaned it was covered with

           id="fnref13"

    <p>The procedure for this third type of imitation coral is significant, not
        just for its fine results but also because of its process of
        transformation. It is analogous to the transformative process attributed
        at that time to natural coral: the viscous red substance, called
        <em>emplastre</em> in the recipe described by de Boodt, could easily
        call to mind the “stonifying sap” of natural coral in his treatment of
        coral. In the same way that the stonifying sap was responsible for the
        transformation of coral from a soft, yielding vegetal material into the
        hardness of stone, the thick red mixture of this recipe solidifies like
        stone. The distinctive way the red substance of the recipe on fol. 3r
        coats the branch recalls Imperato’s description of coral growing over
        other sea plants and covering their branches.<a href="#fn16"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref16"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> The homologies between the
        descriptions of coral by these two naturalists and the recipe on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/3r/f/3r/tl"><u>3r</u></a>
        are suggestive.</p>
    <p>The recipe on fol. 3r can be seen as a material instantiation of the
        knowledge system in which metamorphosis and transformative materials
        were highly valued, and were viewed as providing essential insights into
        the inner workings of nature. The fact that this coral was called
        “counterfeit” did not indicate that it was seen as a forgery or was
        meant to deceive. Rather, some methods for making artificial gems, as
        Imperato tells us, were understood to be similar to the natural
        processes of the formation of stones, implying the possibility that
        artisans, through their observation of nature, could harness its
        processes in order to imitate and understand its processes more
        perfectly.<a href="#fn17"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref17"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> Finally, it is fruitful to
        ponder how the circulation of high value artificial products made by
        artisans could, in turn, have influenced the observation of natural
        phenomena. In the case of coral, it seems likely that the creation by
        artisans of “counterfeits” that aspired to simulate natural processes
        and effects stimulated scholarly conceptions of the workings of nature,
        just as much as the other way around.</p>

                    addition, the Dresden inventory of 1587 features a “man-made
                    coral sprig of [red] Spanish wax” (Dresden Inventory [1587],
                    fol. 199v). Interestingly, in the margins of the 1619
                    version of the Dresden inventory a comment appeared between
                    1620 and 1640, disparaging the “man made coral sprig of
                    Spanish wax” as “unworthy of standing in the
                    <em>Kunstkammer,</em> [as it] is only wood with red color.”
                    (<em>Ist nicht werth, dass in der kunst cammer stehet, ist
                        nur holz mit rother farbe</em>), Dresden Inventory
                    (1619), fol. 319r. The entry must have been made after 1620,
                    when the inventory was begun and before 1640, when a new
                    list was compiled during the undertaking of yet another
                    inventorization. This possibly points to a change in
                    collecting and to attitudes to art and nature, as pursued by
                    Katharina Pilaski Kaliardos, <em>The Munich Kunstkammer:

                    to Andrew Lacey for this last source. It appears that the
                    three thick volumes of the <em>Kunst- und Werck-Schul</em>
                    collected numerous recipes in use by artisans in early
                    modern Europe This work formed the basis for the many
                    editions of Smith’s <em>Laboratory or the School of
                        Arts</em>, which was likely the source for Clarke’s
                    <em>Boy's Own Book</em>, <em>Scientific Mysteries</em>, and
                    other works of popular science. This fascinating case of the

                <p>Interestingly some of these same constituents (pine resin or
                    <em>colofonia</em> and white wax) were also used in the
                    assembly of the Florentine <em>commesso di pietre dure.</em>

                    solidified secretion from a plant) that hardens composing a
                    work of stones appears extremely meaningful, as it
                    replicates the same principle of the "stonifying sap"
                    mentioned by de Boodt, which turned the vegetal organism of
                    coral into a mineral one.<a href="#fnref13"
