        ideas and technologies for the formation of artisans and craftspeople
        outside the peninsula in the sixteenth century? If we use Ms. Fr. 640 as

        story might emerge. The entry “Whitening of cast silver” on fol. <a

        which includes the statement, “I have seen an excellent German working
        thus,” indicates that the author-practitioner observed German
        metalworkers. He included no equivalent observation about metalworking
        craftsmen from any other geographic region; indeed, in remarks about
        techniques used in specific locales, he only mentions Germany in
        connection with metalworking techniques worthy of emulating.</p>
    <h2 id="metalworking-in-the-german-lands">Metalworking in the German Lands
    </h2>
    <p>While scholarly interest has favored Italy as the source of Renaissance
        innovation in casting technology in the early modern era, contemporary
        sixteenth-century chroniclers made clear that the German lands, and
        especially the Imperial Free Cities of the Holy Roman Empire, enjoyed
        international reputations as centers of innovation and invention.
        Nuremberg and Augsburg were especially highly regarded for metalwork.
        Intellectuals and philosophers such as the astronomer Johann
        Regiomontanus chose to settle in Nuremberg in the late fifteenth century
        “because I can easily procure here all necessary instruments,
        particularly those which are indispensable for the study of astronomy,
        and also because I can easily keep up a connection with scholars of all
        countries from here, for this city, on account of its concourse of
        merchants, may be considered the central point of Europe.”<a href="#fn6"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref6"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> The importance of Nuremberg as a
        hub of commerce and wealthy merchants created a highly cosmopolitan city
        that included both scholars and craftsmen known for their work not only
        in the fine arts but also in creating precision instruments for
        timekeeping and astronomical observation. The Parisian philosopher
        Petrus Ramus spent four days in 1568 visiting the artisan workshops of
        Nuremberg and was thoroughly impressed by the way these artisans unified
        theory and practice in their work.<a href="#fn7"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref7"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> In the same period, the master
        goldsmith Wenzel Jamnitzer (1508–1585) was producing complex lifecast
        objects destined for imperial <em>Kunstkammern</em> from his “large and
        prosperous”<a href="#fn8"

        author-practitioner’s interest in casting from life, in portrait medals,
        and in other objects that would have formed part of a
        <em>Kunstkammer</em> collection, makes it possible he was familiar with
        Jamnitzer’s work, an interest that could have drawn him to a study of
        German craft.<a href="#fn9"

    <h2 id="evidence-of-german-metalworkers-in-ms.-fr.-640">Evidence of German
        Metalworkers in Ms. Fr. 640</h2>
    <p>Fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/128v/f/128v/tl"><u>128v</u></a>
        provides an interesting glimpse of the author-practitioner’s esteem for
        German skill. He documents in detail the techniques of the “excellent”
        German metalworker whom he observed clean a silver lizard that had come
        out of its mold with some sort of crust. He makes a point of noting that
        the processes he records were observed in person: the lizard was cast
        “<em>en ma presence”</em> (“in my presence”). A number of other entries
        indicate that the author-practitioner had actually observed German
        craftsmen at work and spoken to them at length about their techniques
        and traditions. On fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/125r/f/125r/tl"><u>125r</u></a>,
        in a recipe discussing the methods for soaking plaster, the author
        provides a striking ethnographic detail: “With this plaster, thus
        reheated as powder, one can cast medals that do not fear the rain,
        especially if they are varnished. One can find these in Germany, on the
        houses. But take heed that the water be very hot, &amp; if it is
        boiling, there is no danger. All plaster molds, alone or mixed, release
        in it.” This observation indicates familiarity with German houses that
        could have come from travel or from conversations with German
        metalworkers.</p>
    <p>The author-practitioner records a number of metalworking techniques that
        he ascribes specifically to the Germans, for example, on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/32v/f/32v/tl"><u>32v</u></a>
        for casting very light candlesticks; fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/63r/f/63r/tl"><u>63r</u></a>
        on German casters’ preference for lead from Flanders; and fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/72v/f/72v/tl"><u>72v</u></a>
        about German techniques for casting lead very thinly. Fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/149r/f/149r/tl"><u>149r</u></a>
        includes two descriptions of German methods, one related to goldsmiths,
        and the other, entitled “Various arts from Germany,” about German
        metalsmiths’ use of mechanized hammers powered by water mills, and the
        specifically German method for drawing iron wire. On fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/159v/f/159v/tl"><u>159v</u></a>,
        a type of waterproof plaster used for statues in German fountains is
        discussed in some detail. Finally, in a note on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/120r/f/120r/tl"><u>120r</u></a>,
        the author-practitioner remarks that certain mixtures to increase the
        fluidity of molten gold have only been widespread in Germany for less
        than forty years. Such specific knowledge about the history of a
        technique would likely have required conversation with a German
        craftsman. In addition, the author-practitioner seems to know a good
        deal about where to source German materials such as the material
        “spalt”—outside the town of Augsburg (fols. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/106r/f/106r/tl"><u>106r</u></a>,
        <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/108r/f/108r/tl"><u>108r</u></a>,
        <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/119r/f/119r/tl"><u>119r</u></a>,
        and <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/119v/f/119v/tl"><u>119v</u></a>),
        and provides detailed information about the best lead, which is used in
        Nuremberg: “The best, fattest &amp; softest is brought from Germany and
        is not in <em>saulmon</em>, but in <em>lattes</em> of around an arm’s
        length &amp; three fingers’ width. It is transported to Lyon, and from
        this, the leaf is made for small mirrors in Nuremberg” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/30r/f/30r/tl"><u>30r</u></a>).
        It is also significant that the author-practitioner appears to have
        employed German words, such as “<em>spalt</em>,” and it may be telling
        that he shows some confusion in rendering this term, alternately using
        “<em>laspalte</em>,” “<em>spalt</em>” or “<em>spat</em>” (see fols. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/106r/f/106r/tl"><u>106r</u></a>,
        <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/108r/f/108r/tl"><u>108r</u></a>,
        <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/119v/f/119v/tl"><u>119v</u></a>,
        <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/138r/f/138r/tl"><u>138r</u></a>).
        He also uses the term “<em>stuf</em>” (<a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/118r/f/118r/tl"><u>118r</u></a>),
        apparently loaned from German.</p>
    <p>No other geographic region is given such attention by name, indicating a
        notable interest in German technique in particular. It seems the
        author-practitioner must have observed many German metalworkers to
        accumulate so much knowledge of their work.</p>
    <h2 id="the-movement-of-craftspeople-in-europe">The Movement of Craftspeople
        in Europe</h2>
    <p>It was not uncommon for craftsmen to travel across regional borders, as
        many journeymen apprentices looking to learn from master craftsmen in
        other communities would spend a portion of their training on the road.
        In the German lands, this travel was known as the <em>Wanderjahr</em>,<a
           href="#fn10"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref10"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> and was compulsory for many
        journeymen craftsmen looking eventually to establish themselves as
        masters in their own right. In 1449, seven percent of Nuremberg’s total
        population was made up of such journeymen, who worked temporarily for
        local craftsmen.<a href="#fn11"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref11"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> In France, this voyage was
        called the <em>Tour de France</em>, and, while generally opposed by the

           id="fnref12"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> remained a popular way for
        journeymen to escape some of the rather strict laws of apprenticeship in

           id="fnref13"

        the best reputation in their craft.<a href="#fn14"

           role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> Significantly, for the context

        mining regions—including the Pyrenees—of the Kingdom of France since the
        fifteenth century. It is possible that the author-practitioner gained
        his knowledge about German metalworking without leaving Toulouse and its
        surroundings.<a href="#fn15"

    <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Despite being relatively equidistant geographically from both the Italian
        peninsula and the German territories, the author-practitioner found
        metalworking techniques from German lands noteworthy, perhaps indicating
        that their reputation for excellence was greater than that of Italy at
        the time. Indeed, the only time he mentions Italy in relation to
        metalworking comes on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/109r/f/109r/tl"><u>109r</u></a>,
        when he describes the Italians’ custom to mix their wax with tallow, a
        less useful technique than mixing it with turpentine or butter.
        Otherwise, Italy and Italian artistic centers such as Florence, Venice,
        Milan, or Rome are mentioned only in relation to the materials to be
        obtained from them,<a href="#fn16"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref16"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> including Venice turpentine,
        paper from Florence, and red lake pigment from both cities. Italian
        technique is only specifically noted in reference to painting.<a

        painting techniques rather than metalworking. From these comments in Ms.
        Fr. 640, we can conclude that, for the author-practitioner, German
        metalworkers and their techniques were most worthy of documentation and
        emulation, providing evidence that Germany might be considered a center
        of casting innovation equal to or greater than Italy at the time.</p>

                <p>Louis IX had produced a <em>Livre des Metiers</em> for
                    Parisian craftsmen in 1268 in an attempt to control labor
                    and undermine the collective power of guilds. This disdain
                    for guild independence seems to have continued for many
                    centuries. For example, in 1539, Francis I decreed that all
                    craft fraternities and organizations be disbanded, a decree
                    that was never followed to the letter, but that led to the
                    somewhat clandestine nature of the <em>Tour de France</em>
                    and guild practices. See François Icher, <em>The Artisans
                        and Guilds of France: Beautiful Craftsmanship through
                        the Centuries</em> (New York: Harry N. Abrams, 2000),
