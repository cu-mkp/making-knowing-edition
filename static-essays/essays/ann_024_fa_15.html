        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <div>
            <p>This essay investigates the entry “Painting in oil on taffeta” on
                fol. <a
                   href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/42v/f/42v/tl"><u>42v</u></a>,
                a short recipe for a coating that can be applied to taffeta to
                prepare it to receive oil paint. In aim, the recipe is similar
                to a more detailed set of instructions on fol. <a
                   href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/10v/f/10v/tl"><u>10v</u></a>
                for making a priming coat to prevent oil paint from “running” or
                bleeding when painted on taffeta; however, the recipe on fol.
                42v differs in materials and technique. As the recipe offers no
                quantities or proportions for the three ingredients, the essay
                questions whether this information was unknown to the
                author-practitioner, a workshop secret, or an implicit
                acknowledgement that quantities might need to be adjusted by
                trial and error to accommodate different pigments and oil
                binders.</p>

    <p>Ms. Fr. 640 contains very few references to working with fabric but
        specifies two methods by which one can paint on cloth in oil without the
        oil running.<a href="#fn1"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref1"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> The repetition of this topic
        between fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/10v/f/10v/tl"><u>10v</u></a>
        and fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/42v/f/42v/tl"><u>42v</u></a>
        suggests a demand for painted taffeta, and the simplicity of the
        respective entries offers an opportunity to determine the necessity and
        role of each individual ingredient.<a href="#fn2"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref2"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> While the recipe on fol. 42v,
        “Painting in oil on taffeta,” aims to replicate the outcome of the
        instructions on fol. 10v, “For painting in oil on taffeta without the
        oil running,” the steps to reach that goal differ almost entirely,
        warranting further exploration of this second technique.<a href="#fn3"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref3"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
    <p>Our expectations for the outcome of the recipe on fol. 42v were based on
        our reconstruction research of the recipe on fol. 10v. Fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/42v/f/42v/tl"><u>42v</u></a>
        calls for “honey, alum water &amp; starch water” and fol. 10v calls for
        a layer of “strong glue” (<em>colle forte</em>) “soaked for 24 hours in
        water then gently brought to boil so that it is hardly strong,” with
        some honey added. The use of a “strong glue,” probably made from animal
        skins,<a href="#fn4"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref4"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> and honey suggests a rather
        sticky consistency, so we expected the alum water (made by boiling
        potash alum in water until the alum dissolves) and starch water to
        produce a similar consistency. Indeed the viscous wheat starch paste
        (i.e., our “starch water”) resembled an animal skin glue, while the alum
        water served to dilute it.</p>
    <p>A comparison of the recipe on fol. 42v with other uses of alum water in
        the manuscript revealed that alum water is also used to fix a dye. A
        recipe for making gray wood on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/73r/f/73r/tl"><u>73r</u></a>
        includes the use of alum water. Potash alum was used in Europe in the
        sixteenth century to harden “gelatinous sizes.”<a href="#fn5"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref5"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> This may suggest that its role in
        the recipe was to allow the color to retain its strength while speeding
        the drying.</p>
    <p>Equally obscure was the “starch water” (<em>eau d’amydon</em>). Randle
        Cotgrave’s <em>Dictionarie of the French and English Tongues</em> (1611)
        translates <em>amydon</em> as a “fine wheat flour steeped in water.”<a
           href="#fn6"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref6"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> Though of a much later date, we
        found a helpful explanation in a nineteenth-century book of chemistry of
        the term “amidin,” which derives from the French <em>amydon</em> and is
        a synonym for “gelatinous starch” produced when ground wheat grains,
        added to water, expand and form “a transparent jelly” or wheat starch
        paste.<a href="#fn7"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref7"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> We hypothesized that such a paste
        seemed a likely interpretation of the recipe’s “starch water,” since
        this paste—or amidin—much like the “strong glue” (<em>colle forte</em>)
        in the recipe on fol. 10v, would enhance the adhesive quality of the
        layer.<a href="#fn8"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref8"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
    <p>Honey, although the most straightforward ingredient in the recipe,
        retained some degree of mystery. Its particular role in the recipe can
        be illuminated with other references to honey in the manuscript. Fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/10v/f/10v/tl"><u>10v</u></a>
        calls for honey to “soften” the glue mixture, though the particular
        meaning of the word “soften” is not made clear.<a href="#fn9"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref9"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> A recipe on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/32r/f/32r/tl"><u>32r</u></a>
        for laying gold on distemper is especially enlightening. It references
        the use of “batture” (also mentioned in the recipe on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/10v/f/10v/tl"><u>10v</u></a>)
        and says to add “very little honey, that is to say a few drops to make
        it stick.”<a href="#fn10"

           id="fnref10"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> Honey is thus revealed to be a
        thickening agent, and we are furthermore given some indication of
        quantity, which is otherwise lacking in the recipe.<a href="#fn11"

    <h2 id="observations-and-conclusions">Observations and Conclusions</h2>
    <p>For the reconstruction of the taffeta recipe on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/42v/f/42v/tl"><u>42v</u></a>,
        we separated the taffeta into four squares to isolate the effect of the
        various ingredients that this recipe lists for a “first layer”
        (<em>couche premiere</em>) to prepare the fabric for an application of
        oil paint.<a href="#fn12"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref12"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> When we applied the first layer
        mixture to the taffeta, we found that the trials with significantly more
        alum water than amidin dried with tiny white particles on the surface.
    </p>
    <p>After applying oil paint to the taffeta treated with this “first layer,”
        it became clear that the “running” of oil referred to the oil spreading
        beyond the painted area. We used a paint that we composed from linseed
        oil (with trials of cold pressed and stand oils) and madder lake
        pigment. As the paint dried, dark oil stains formed around the edges of
        the paint (<i><u>Fig. 1</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 2</u></i> <i><u>Fig.
                3</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 4</u></i>). The trials with more alum
        water retained a deeper red color. This may have been due to the alum
        water’s function as a mordant, which can help fix the color. The alum
        water also seemed to facilitate applying the first layer of mixture to
        the taffeta. Since alum water is mentioned in both taffeta recipes on
        fol. 10v and fol. 42v, we assumed that it would play an important role
        in preventing oil from “running.” However, our trials showed that the
        oil spread even further when oil paint was applied to first layers
        containing more alum water. Moreover, mixing the pigments with stand oil
        rather than cold pressed linseed oil caused the oil <em>and</em> paint
        to spread further (<i><u>Fig. 5</u></i>).</p>

    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>A description of such an effect can be
        found in a copy of Roger de Piles’s book <em>Élémens de peinture
            pratique</em>. Although the book is not contemporaneous with Ms. Fr.
        640 (it was published after de Piles’s death in 1709), it does provide a
        point of comparison for the recipes. In de Piles’s book, the recipe
        reads as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>One needs to first prepare the taffeta with a gum, the composition of
            which is as follows. Take fish glue as large as a bean, cut it in
            little pieces, &amp; soak it for twelve hours in a glass of water.
            Next melt it on a fire just until boiling, then drain it and let it
            cool. When one wants to use it, one needs to heat it, &amp; having
            stretched your taffeta well, apply it quite hot with a sponge, as
            evenly as it can be. Once the taffeta is dry, you can lay your
            colors on it, without worrying that they will soak in or that they
            will spread more than they should.<a href="#fn13"
               class="footnote-ref"
               id="fnref13"
               role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>It is interesting to compare the different
        descriptions of what this layer prevents in de Piles’s recipe with the
        Ms. Fr. 640 recipes. While fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/10v/f/10v/tl"><u>10v</u></a>
        provides a recipe for a first layer “for painting in oil on taffeta
        without the oil running,” de Piles’ recipe gives instructions for a
        first glue layer that prevents colors from soaking or spreading more
        than they should, which may accord with our experiment using red paint
        prepared with stand oil.</p>
    <p>As mentioned above, neither of the recipes specifies any quantities or
        proportions (except to say just a little honey), which might suggest
        that they call for similar amounts of alum and wheat starch powder, or
        perhaps that the proportions were considered to be common knowledge. We
        observed significant differences among the four groups with varying
        ratios of alum water and starch water. Quantity matters in making the
        first layer because too little alum water will make the taffeta crumple
        while too much will not prevent the oil from spreading. The absence of
        proportions, though not uncommon, is noteworthy. As in the other taffeta
        recipe on fol. 10v, this seems to call for trial and error to achieve
        the desired effect on fabric. Since the quality of the taffeta,
        pigments, and oils used could change, our author-practitioner might be
        implying here that it is up to the person following the recipe to find
        the proper proportions “by judgement and discretion” (<em>par jugement
            &amp; discretion</em>), a phrase he uses on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/158v/f/158v/tl"><u>158v</u></a>
        in a recipe for “Colors for green leaves.”<a href="#fn14"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref14"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> It is also possible that the
        author-practitioner himself did not know the specific proportions. As we
        suggested, judging by the brevity of the recipe, the author-practitioner
        might have copied or heard of the recipe without particular proportions
        and wrote it down, not (yet) having tested it himself. Further, it could
        be that the proportions were a workshop secret, with the craftsmen
        unwilling to divulge this integral piece of information. Finally, we
        must consider the readers of such a manuscript. If they wanted to
        perform trials following the instructions of the manuscript as we do
        today, it might appear inconvenient but probably not unexpected to an
        early modern reader that the author-practitioner did not record the
        proportions. As we noted above, this might suggest that the
        author-practitioner expected that anyone using his recipes would read
        them as an invitation to experiment to find the optimal proportions,
        taking into consideration the type, condition, and quality of the oil,
        starch water, alum water, and taffeta used. This echoes William Eamon’s
        reading of recipes as “prescriptions for an experiment” in his research
        on early modern books of secrets.<a href="#fn15"
