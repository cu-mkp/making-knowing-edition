        <div>
            <p>The author-practitioner’s detailed description of how to raise
                silkworms according to conventional early modern sericultural
                methods in “Silkworms” on fol. <a
                   href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/53v/f/53v/tl"><u>53v</u></a>
                is related by material and timing to a quite unusual entry on
                fol. <a
                   href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/52r/f/52r/tl"><u>52r</u></a>,
                “The work done in Algiers.” This entry involves raising a
                silkworm in a flask to produce a powder that transforms antimony
                into gold. “The work done in Algiers” also relates to another
                entry in BnF Ms. Fr. 640 for creating a strong poison by
                putrefying snails in a flask. Taken together, these recipes fall
                into a genre of alchemical recipes for producing strong agents
                by putrefying small but symbolic creatures in flasks. This
                annotation explores the movement of this complex of ideas and
                practices from China to North Africa to Toulouse. My
                reconstruction suggests that “Silkworms” and “The work done in
                Algiers” serve as examples of Ms. Fr. 640 as both a practical
                record and as encouraging its user to tread into realms of as
                yet untested knowledge.</p>

    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
    <p>Folios <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/52r/f/52r/tl"><u>52r</u></a>–v
        and <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/53v/f/53v/tl"><u>53v</u></a>
        present an unusual set of entries in BnF Ms. Fr. 640, both containing
        processes involving silkworms. Fol. 53v contains a detailed and
        evocative description of raising silkworms, while fol. 52r has a recipe
        apparently connected to alchemical transmutation. Careful examination of
        these two entries reveals a series of surprises. First, the two entries
        are connected: “The work done in Algiers” on 52r and “Silkworms,” one
        folio away on 53v, both involve growing silkworms from eggs, and the
        dates mentioned in “Algiers” for starting up the process match up with
        the end date given in the “Silkworms” entry for producing eggs in order
        to start the cycle of growing the worms. Next, the level of detail that
        the author-practitioner provides for raising silkworms, as well as his
        references to an external source (a didactic poem published in 1527 by
        Marco Girolamo Vida, Bishop of Alba and Cremona),<a href="#fn1"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref1"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> shows familiarity with early
        modern sericulture practices. Yet compared to contemporary works on
        sericulture (which are usually exhaustive treatises), the
        author-practitioner’s account of raising silkworms is quite brief. What
        is most unusual about this pair of entries, however, is the
        author-practitioner’s description about how to use silkworm eggs in
        creating a gold-producing powder, “as they do in Algiers” (fol. 52r).<a
           href="#fn2"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref2"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> This is a marked departure from
        contemporaneous literature on silkworms.</p>
    <p>This essay explores the relationship of the entries for “Silkworms” and
        “The work done in Algiers” to Easter and the summer solstice. I also
        reconstruct the author-practitioner’s instructions for growing silkworms
        in order to explore this connection. This essay also considers the
        possible alchemical nature of the author-practitioner’s interest in
        sealing small creatures in a vessel to produce a powerful transformative
        agent, as well as the relation of these entries to the movement of
        materials and practices across Eurasia.<a href="#fn3"

        Relationship Between “Silkworms” and “The work done in Algiers”</h2>
    <p>The “Algiers” recipe on fol. 52r and the “Silkworms” entry a page and a
        half later, on fol. 53r, are separated by a few short entries about
        colors, plants, and metals.<a href="#fn4"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref4"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> The proximity of the two entries
        in the manuscript, the materials (silkworm eggs) involved in both
        entries, and the overlap of timing around the Easter holidays and summer
        solstice seem to indicate that the purpose of “Silkworms” is not to
        extract silk threads from cocoons (the manuscript contains no
        information on how to perform the process of unravelling cocoons to pull
        out the threads, known as “reeling”), but to prepare freshly laid
        silkworm eggs for the “work done in Algiers.” Close examination of the
        essential elements laid out in “The work done in Algiers” provides
        support for this connection:</p>

        <li>
            <blockquote>

            </blockquote>
        </li>
        <li>
            <blockquote>
                <p>the silkworm eggs themselves, whose hatchlings are expected
                    to consume each other until there is only one survivor;</p>
            </blockquote>
        </li>
        <li>
            <blockquote>
                <p>the surviving silkworm is fed fresh egg yolks mixed with gold
                    leaf on an hourly basis for several months until it is
                    burned in the vessel and its ash is used to transmute metals
                    into fine gold.</p>
            </blockquote>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Taken together, this information from “Algiers” establishes a timeline
        for the production of the surviving silkworm, which, once burned, will
        form an agent of metallic transmutation. The “Algiers” entry concludes,
        “The term of the work is nine months from the feast of St Jehan [June
        24th, near the summer solstice] until the 25th of April.” This statement
        provides the link for understanding “Silkworms” as a preparatory entry
        for “Algiers,” as a corresponding reference in “Silkworms” states: “they
        [the hatched moths] have completed spinning &amp; making their eggs in
        three weeks &amp; around Saint Jehan’s Day. And at that time one keeps
        their eggs &amp; seed until Holy Week” (the week immediately preceding
        Easter which is always the first Sunday after the first full moon
        occurring on or after the spring equinox). While the occurrence of Holy
        Week shifts each year, April 25th is the latest possible date upon which
        Easter can fall.<a href="#fn6"
           class="footnote-ref"

           role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
    <h2 id="silkworms-and-resurrection">Silkworms and Resurrection</h2>
    <p>The correspondence of the dates mentioned in the two entries betrays a
        deeper connection to a cycle of growth and rebirth both in nature and in
        the Christian liturgical year. John the Baptist’s Day, occurring close
        to the summer solstice—the longest day in the year—is followed by the
        significant period of nine months—the length of human gestation—to the
        feast of the Resurrection, which occurs near the spring equinox, the
        turning point of the natural year and time of rebirth of the natural
        world. This timing indicates additional dimensions to these two entries
        on silkworms.</p>
    <p>For a start, the author-practitioner refers to resurrection when he
        writes about the silkworms on fol. 52r, “each time they remain 4 or five
        days resting without eating, as if they were dying so as to be born
        again.” This reference is also present in Bishop Vida’s poem on the
        nature of silkworms, which the author-practitioner cites in the margin
        on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/53v/f/53v/tl"><u>53v</u></a>.
        The following excerpt from Vida’s <em>The silkworm: a poem in two
            books</em> sheds light on the author-practitioner’s interest in this
        work:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Imprison’d dark within the silky ball</p>
        <p>Compleat their labours, and resign their breath</p>
        <p>Exhausted, sinking in the shades of death.</p>
        <p>Go wond’rous race, thrice happy artists go</p>
        <p>Meet fate content, to you the sisters owe</p>
        <p>A second birth; kind Venus shall requite</p>
        <p>Your toils, and raise you to the realms of light…<a href="#fn7"
               class="footnote-ref"
               id="fnref7"
               role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>The “second birth” cited in the passage
        above is reminiscent of the author-practitioner’s words about the
        silkworms, “dying so as to be born again,” on fol. 53v. Both Vida and
        the author-practitioner share the metaphorical use of silkworms to
        invoke resurrection.</p>
    <p>A later account by seventeenth-century sericulturist Christophe Isnard
        also connects silkworms with the process of resurrection of a phoenix in
        his poem:<a href="#fn8"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref8"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>This celebrated artisan, of an immortal life,</p>
        <p>Comparable to no other being in its fate</p>
        <p>Leaves and takes up life again, as soon as it emerges,</p>
        <p>And the end of its course, is followed by another.</p>
        <p>If for this the Phoenix, is the envy of others,</p>
        <p>This worm would have occasion to raise itself with greater strength,
        </p>
        <p>For being beyond the reach of death</p>
        <p>Its form is ravished [i.e., carried away] from its body four times.<a
               href="#fn9"
               class="footnote-ref"
               id="fnref9"
               role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>Silkworms were, then, not just a prized
        commodity for the material they produced. They could also act as a
        metaphor for regeneration and resurrection. A miracle involving
        silkworms was even recorded in Spain during the reign of Alfonso X
        (1252–1284) in which the Virgin Mary compelled silkworms to spin a
        complete wimple in less than an hour.<a href="#fn10"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref10"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> As the embodiment of
        regeneration and rebirth, this lowly worm could simultaneously bring
        temporal commercial wealth and signify eternal resurrection and
        immortality.</p>
    <h2 id="silkworms-and-regeneration">Silkworms and Regeneration</h2>
    <p>The “Algiers” recipe involves hatching silkworm eggs in an enclosed flask
        where they are to feed on egg yolks and each other. When the sole
        surviving silkworm grows to resemble a serpent, it is burned and
        produces a toxic vapor—its ash is to be used to transmute metals into
        gold. I provide a sketched description of this process: <i><u>Fig. 1</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 2</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 3</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 4</u></i>,

    <p>Ms. Fr. 640 contains another recipe that also produces a potent agent, a
        “horrible poison,” by closing lowly creatures—in this case,
        snails—within a flask. This recipe, which spans folios <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/55r/f/55r/tl"><u>55r</u></a>–v,
        calls for snails and results in a poison that will kill a person when
        “spread on a board over which the person walks, or on stirrups.”
        Although snails rather than silkworms are involved in this particular
        recipe, it contains several parallels to “Algiers:” the snails are
        sealed in a glass bottle, fed boiled egg yolks, and kept in the bottle
        buried in horse manure until the substance turns into a powerfully toxic
        substance. Like “Algiers,” the preparation of this poison also happens
        around midsummer, “in the month of June and July.”<a href="#fn11"

        appear to be related to those in a twelfth-century metalworking account
        by the pseudonymous Theophilus in which basilisk powder is the key
        ingredient for making “Spanish Gold.”<a href="#fn12"

        <em>Rechter Gebrauch der Alchimei</em> (1531), which outlines a process
        of sealing lizards in a vessel to create gold:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>In a pot wide at the bottom and narrow at the top, with a cover that
            has air holes in it, place nine lizards in the milk, put the cover
            on, and bury in damp earth. Make sure the lizards have air so that
            they do not die. Let it stand… The lizards will have eaten the brass
            from hunger, and their strong poison will have compelled the brass
            to “transform itself to gold.”<a href="#fn14"

    </blockquote>
    <p>There are many similarities between the recipes in Ms. Fr. 640 for the
        work of Algiers, the “horrible poison,” and the processes of creating
        gold and gold-producing agents in the texts of Theophilus and the
        <em>Rechter Gebrauch:</em> enclosing low creatures in a flask, feeding
        them agricultural foodstuffs that are normally inedible for them (eggs
        for silkworms and snails; milk for lizards), and transforming the
        animals and substances into a highly valuable or inordinately poisonous
        substance through a process of putrefaction and regeneration. On fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/98r/f/98r/tl"><u>98r</u></a>,
        the author-practitioner also notes a relationship between metals,
        lizards, and gold: “Leadsmiths say that making a lizard die in the
        melted tin makes the tin become very golden,” adding more prosaically,
        “Or else by adding sal ammoniac.”</p>
    <p>These recipes for the production of agents of transformation from various
        types of low creatures seems to be connected with their physical
        properties: snakes and lizards shed their skins, lizards can regenerate
        their tails when detached, lizards, snakes and frogs emerge from the
        ground fully grown after freezing winters, and insects, salamanders,
        frogs, toads and other such creatures were regarded as generating
        spontaneously from putrefying materials.<a href="#fn15"

        to produce gold.</p>
    <h2 id="silkworms-and-gu">Silkworms and <em>Gu</em></h2>
    <p>Instead, the author-practitioner’s use of silkworms has an intriguing
        correspondence to a body of knowledge from China that dates back to 1400
        BCE: the concept of <em>Gu</em> (written <em>Ku</em> in the Wade-Giles
        system).<a href="#fn17"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref17"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> <em>Gu</em> refers to procedures
        associated with certain—usually minority—cultures in the southwestern
        regions of China. These procedures had the aim of producing wealth or
        poison, and worked by sealing creatures such as poisonous snakes and
        insects in a vessel, “until there is but one survivor, which is called
        the ku.”<a href="#fn18"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref18"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
    <p>The traditional Chinese character for <em>Gu</em> is succinctly captured
        in the strokes of its written form. <em>Gu</em>, in fact, is formed from
        two radicals, <em>Chong</em> (蟲) and <em>Min</em> (皿), to form
        <em>Gu</em> (蠱). <em>Chong</em> is a term that refers to small, residual
        creatures somewhere between worms and insects,<a href="#fn19"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref19"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a> and <em>Min</em> literally means
        vessel or receptacle. The <em>Gu</em> character is formed by the
        character for <em>Chong</em> in its upper register while <em>Min</em>
        constitutes the lower register. Thus, the character itself embodies the
        placing of worm-bugs in a vessel for the process of <em>Gu</em>.<a

    <p>In the twelfth century, <em>Gu</em> began to be associated with another
        word: <em>Jin can</em> (金蚕), which translates to Golden (金) Silkworm
        (蚕). The concept of the Golden Silkworm predates its associations with
        Gu as “the silkworm that generates silk thread, literally spitting out
        money.” Jincan 金蠶 from Xu Xuan’s 徐鉉 (916–991) <em>Jishen lu</em> 稽神錄
        (“Record of the investigation of spirits”) tells of a man finding (and
        discarding) a gold-colored silkworm larva inside of a perfectly round
        stone.<a href="#fn21"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref21"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a> Twelfth-century Chinese scholars
        identified several morphological varieties of <em>Gu</em> based on the

        Tao, a scholar and official in the Northern Song Dynasty, was the first

        texts began to identify and classify the <em>Jincan</em>, including
        medical texts that provided antidotes for its harmful properties. One
        text from the Southern Song Dynasty, most likely from the first half of
        the thirteenth century, contains a concise and informative account of
        the practice:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Southern people rear golden silkworms. The silkworm has a golden
            color and feeds on silk textiles from Sichuan. Its excrement is used
            to poison people by adding it into food. Whoever eats this will die.
            The silkworm can bring fortune to its owner, and make him rich. It
            cannot be killed by water and blade. [If one wants to get rid of it,
            one must] place the silkworm into a gold or silver vessel and leave
            it on the road. Whoever picks it up will become its new owner. This
            is called ‘marrying out the golden silkworm.’<a href="#fn24"

    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>Various sources discuss the duality
        inherent in the <em>Gu</em> practice: it is capable of bringing both
        fortune and failure, of being both a poison and benefit, similar to the
        processes in European texts.</p>
    <p>Another similarity of the “Algiers” process and <em>Gu</em> practice can
        be found in the timing of the processes. Recall that in “Algiers,” the
        silkworm eggs are to be sprinkled on top of chicken egg yolks in a flask
        and buried under manure around the Feast of Saint John, the date
        associated with the summer solstice in the Gregorian Calendar. The
        traditional Chinese <em>Gu</em> preparations occurred on the “fifth day
        of the fifth month,”<a href="#fn25"

    <h2 id="reconstruction">Reconstruction </h2>
    <p>This essay began with my proposition that the “Silkworms” entry on fol.
        <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/53v/f/53v/tl"><u>53v</u></a>
        should be seen as a preparatory step to provide the silkworm eggs
        necessary for “The work done in Algiers” on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/52r/f/52r/tl"><u>52r</u></a>,
        the entry that aims to create a giant, gold-dust-producing silkworm.
        While I contend that the author-practitioner most likely did not
        undertake the “Algiers” recipe, I sought to reconstruct both of the
        recipes in order to see what insights I might gain from cultivating the
        silkworms and going through the initial steps of “Algiers.”</p>
    <p>At the time of this writing (May 2017), “Algiers” has yielded only a
        moldy flask (<i><u>Fig. 7</u></i>). For the “Algiers” reconstruction, I
        used both ready-to-hatch eggs (just like those used in the “Silkworms”
        reconstruction below) and freshly laid silkworm eggs between 2-3 days
        old. In order to fulfill the conditions of “Algiers,” I used a cooler
        padded with foam insulation to imitate the ground in which the reaction
        flask would be buried. Instead of manure, I used two ice/heat gel
        packs.<a href="#fn29"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref29"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a> During the work, I reheated the
        packs twice a day, every 12 hours. I did not close the cooler lid all
        the way in order to leave allow air to circulate in. I loosely stopped
        up the flask with a paper towel as the embodiment of the “I do not know
        if it is at all necessary for the generation that there be air” that the
        author-practitioner expresses on fol. 52v (<i><u>Fig. 8</u></i> and <i><u>Fig. 9</u></i>). After approximately eight days, when the eggs
        should have been hatching, the entirety of the flask was taken over by a
        violent green mold. It covered large patches of the thickened egg yolk
        and covered the places where the silkworm eggs lay half-submerged (Fig.
        7). Luckily, I was able to observe this since I was using a glass flask,
        but if one were following the author-practitioner’s steps precisely and
        simply changing out the manure around a clay vessel, it might be months
        before one realized that nothing but mold and decay were happening
        inside the vessel, and that no gold powder-producing silkworm was
        forthcoming, although the author-practitioner might have regarded such
        putrefaction as simply a first step toward regeneration.<a href="#fn30"

    <p>The silkworms under my care, in the habitat I constructed for them
        according to “Silkworms,” are approximately one week away from the point
        at which they should begin spinning cocoons in order to transform into
        moths. On the mulberry leaf diet, they are growing rapidly each day—the
        largest worms now have eight distinctly visible legs (legs now
        surrounded by fine, short bristly hairs) and are approximately the
        length of three-quarters of my ring finger; it will not be long until we
        reach the author-practitioner’s assurance that, “when it begins to spin,
        it is as long as a ring finger and has eight legs” (fol. 53v). Obviously
        my experiment will continue beyond the submission of this essay (perhaps
        there will even be a sequel to this work at a later date).</p>
    <p>Although it cannot be determined definitively, it seems quite possible
        that the author-practitioner cultivated silkworms or at least observed
        the process firsthand. Following his instructions, I began the
        reconstruction by locating a room such that, “if during the day there is
        any storm or rainy weather, cloudy and cool, one needs to keep in the
        room three or 4 embers and with glowing coal” (fol. 53v). This took the
        form of the furnace room in my home in Brooklyn. On a shelf above the
        boiler that maintains a consistent temperature—stormy weather or fine—of
        75–82 degrees Fahrenheit, which is the approximate temperature
        recommended for hatching silkworm eggs,<a href="#fn31"

        sought by all those hoping to establish a silkworm industry in an
        inhospitable environment. For example, Tsar Alexis of Russia (1629–1676)
        wrote a command, never fulfilled, “to find such a master, however much
        it might cost, who might be able to… feed the worms with such food that
        would be comparable to mulberry, perhaps by extracting oil from the
        mulberry tree, or oil from the leaves, or grass soaked in such oil, to
        feed the worms, so with God’s help we can produce silk in Moscow.”<a

    <p>My field notes document in detail the various stages of silkworm
        development I have observed. What was most notable about the experience
        was understanding just how labor intensive and delicate the process of
        raising silkworms was. For example, Ester Geraci of the Como Silk Museum
        writes, “since silkworms require a constant, mild temperature, entire
        sections of farmhouses were turned over to them and whole families would
        often pitch in, stoking round-the-clock fires to maintain the proper
        warmth.”<a href="#fn35"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref35"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>35</sup></a> And sixteenth-century writer
        Leonardo Fioravanti noted that “no one is to be found who is capable of
        doing on his own the many tasks that it (sericulture) involves.”<a
           href="#fn36"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref36"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>36</sup></a> I too found that I had to rely
        on my family to cover the demanding feeding schedule when I was running
        late. Because of this investment of effort and time, I experienced
        multiple moments of acute fear that I had completely failed. First, I
        feared that the worms would never hatch. And, when they did, I feared
        that they had died within the first week. Here, the
        author-practitioner’s advice that, “they remain 4 or five days resting
        without eating, as if they were dying so as to be born again” (fol. 53v)
        came as a great source of comfort and relief. The worms did indeed
        become more active after their death-like states, and my worries came to
        naught.</p>
    <p>Many of the milestones in the process of silkworm rearing occurred
        according to the author-practitioner’s description. The rest periods and
        the color changes coincided almost exactly with the 4-5 day intervals
        described on fol. 53v. However, some points were not fully discussed in
        the manuscript. For example, the instructions in “Silkworms” state that,
        “three times per day, it is necessary to change the leaves for fresh
        ones” (fol. 53v). Yet, this process was much more difficult than it
        seemed. Even though I had to remove thin noodles of dried Mulberry Chow
        instead of leaves, it was difficult to get all the silkworms off. They
        not only tenaciously stuck to the food, but even after I plucked them
        off, they remained attached to the hardened, dried old food by invisible
        silky strands (<i><u>Fig. 14</u></i>). I nearly lost several worms in
        this manner, almost accidentally throwing them away. If my
        consternations seems absurd, consider how frightening it was to
        <em>pluck</em> the worms off of their food after reading the following
        seventeenth-century account by natural philosopher and sericulturist
        Olivier de Serres (1539–1619), which warns against breathing on the
        worms, or even looking at them the wrong way:</p>

    <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Overall, the entire process of obtaining the eggs (finding a dealer,
        negotiating price, gauging quality), constructing the right environment,
        and caring for the silkworms on a daily basis has instilled in me both
        sentimental and grandiose ideas. In building a little world, a
        reproduction of nature (<i><u>Fig. 16</u></i>), I found myself feeling
        like a god to these creatures under my care, as is obvious from my early
        field notes: “every now and then they lift up half of their bodies like
        birds with hungry mouths or like some sort of acolytes performing a
        salutation to the sun, which in their case is a naked bulb in the
        furnace room (<i><u>Fig. 17</u></i>).”<a href="#fn38"

                beginning to look less like a sterile piece of agricultural
                equipment and more like a world-in-miniature. The leaves form a
                sort of artificial forest for the silkworms; although a far cry
                from a real forest, this little box is nonetheless a sign of
                progress in learning nature enough to make a decent enough
                imitation of it to give the silkworms a natural-seeming habitat.

                attempts to capture the eerie motion of the silkworms’
                salutations. Perhaps they were simply stretching out, but on
                numerous occasions a particular worm I would shine a flashlight
                on would raise up half of his (or her) body and perform what I
                can only describe as a reverse bow, a sign of acknowledgment. In
                creating this small world and habitat for the worms and
                realizing that at all moments I control their fate, I have
                entered an almost divine state. Although it is most likely that
                the worms are just barely aware of me, I am forced to consider
                the possibility that they are indeed conscious of the existence
                of the super-being external to their closed system (me). ©

    <p>I look forward to experiencing the curiosities of the further development
        of my silky friends. I look forward to seeing whether it is true, as the
        author-practitioner notes, that “two or three and up to eleven worms put
        themselves in a cocoon” (fol. 54r). I have certainly seen some worms
        being quite friendly and intertwining with each other, and it is
        possible that they will continue their affair in the death and rebirth
        of metamorphosis.</p>
    <h2 id="coda">Coda</h2>
    <p>The silkworms began spinning cocoons within days of each other.<a
           href="#fn39"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref39"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>39</sup></a> I checked to see whether “when
        it begins to spin, it is as long as a ring finger and has eight legs”
        (fol. 53v), and found that the silkworms were indeed quite large,
        approximately 3/4 the length of my ring finger and a little thinner
        around. Silkworms actually have six legs (three pairs) and five pairs of
        “pseudopods,” which may account for the author-practitioner putting the
        number at eight. To spin a cocoon, a silkworm situated itself within a
        few small sticks close together, then attached a single silk thread to
        one such branch and began pulling the string out of itself, much like a
        magician pulls handkerchiefs tied together out of a pocket. First, each
        silkworm used its single thread to form a wide hammock, an area of
        approximately 8-10 centimeters in circumference, in which it could be
        suspended. Several hours later, the silkworm reclined and continued
        pulling the unbroken silk thread, attaching it to anchor points
        throughout this ample hammock, still visible within the first struts of
        what would be the cocoon. Even after the metamorphosis chamber seemed to
        be fully formed, the silkworm evidently continued its labors as the
        cocoon shifted and moved for two or three hours more. Then it grew
        still.</p>
    <p>Approximately a week after the first spinning started, they were all
        encased in their own threads. I did not observe “two or three and up to
        eleven worms put themselves in a cocoon” (fol. 54r), but it is not
        unimaginable that multiple silkworms might get trapped in each others’
        “hammocks” and form such a multiple cocoon. About half the cocoons were
        yellow as sulfur, the others white as cotton. The first moth hatched on
        the tenth day after cocooning, and the others hatched in the following
        five days. To hatch, the moths opened a small hole at the tip of the
        cocoon and emerged—they do not have mouths, but they probed and pushed
        their way out. The silkworms hatched quite beautifully and enjoyed
        approximately two weeks of wonderful, hedonistic life—during this period
        they emerged from their cocoons, flapped their wings, enjoyed the warm
        summer air in my backyard, mated, and laid eggs (<i><u>Fig. 18</u></i>).
        They do not have the ability to eat as moths, so mating was their
        primary activity, which they did with gusto.</p>

    <p>I released most of the moths into the wild and kept ten for observation.
        Three pairs seemed to mate by attaching their tails together. Two of the
        females laid eggs in the box in which they had been larva. One of the
        pairs could not detach after mating and after attempting to move
        around—wildly buzzing their wings—for two days, both finally died, still
        attached, having laid no eggs. The remaining four silkmoths did not
        mate.</p>
    <p>I attempted to preserve the eggs in my garage, but when I checked on them
        in mid-February, far too early for them to have hatched, I found that
        the eggs had indeed hatched, perhaps due to an early warm spell, and the
        dry larva had perished from lack of food.</p>

                <p>Chong has been roughly translated into English as “wug” by

                    corresponds to the Chinese folk conception of Chong, which
                    means, “small residual creatures that are neither worms nor

                    century). This treatise using animal substances, especially
                    eggs and worms, for transmutation, seems to have been
                    translated from an Arabic original, probably belonging to
                    the Jabirian corpus.” Robert Halleux, “The Reception of
                    Arabic Alchemy in the West,” in <em>Encyclopedia of the
                        history of Arabic science</em>, ed. R. Rashed (London:

                <p>Prior to starting this work, I timed the gel packs and the
                    cooler and found that the temperature in the cooler rises to
                    ~38 degrees celsius when the heat packs are first
                    introduced. Within 6 - 8 hours, the temperature within the
                    cooler drops back down to ~23 degrees Celsius. In a way this
                    serves “Algiers” well, as it imitates what the temperatures
                    might be like in the city as they fluctuate between morning
                    and evening.<a href="#fnref29"

                <p>But perhaps these steps are not as far-fetched as they seem.
                    For example, in modern sericulture, an acid wash is used to
                    “break” silkworm eggs out of diapause and allow them to have
                    multiple hatching periods in one year. The acidity of a
                    fresh-laid chicken egg yolk is pH 6.0, which is slightly
                    acidic. Perhaps the the chicken egg yolks are intended to be
                    an early modern acidic agent that allows the silkworm eggs
                    to hatch when they should be in diapause. A 1980 scientific
                    paper from the Indian Sericulture Institute corroborates the
                    author-practitioner’s indication that the “Algiers” work
                    must begin as the “Silkworms” ends, “...around the feast of
                    Saint John,” because, according to the scientific paper,
                    “there is a critical period in the embryonic morphogenesis
                    during which the treatment is most effective… Eggs treated
                    after 48 hours of oviposition result in bad and irregular
                    hatching, while the eggs treated after 3 days after
                    oviposition will have less than 10% hatching.” For further
                    information on modern acid wash procedures, see N.M. Saheb,
                    K. Sengupta, and G.V. Reddy, <em>A Treatise on the Acid
