        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <div>
            <p>Important clues about manuscripts can be inferred through
                analysis of their bindings. This essay not only examines Ms. Fr.
                640’s current binding, but also attempts to determine its
                original construction and appearance by comparing it with other
                French manuscripts available in the collections of Columbia
                University Libraries, and by reconstructing a model of its
                binding and gatherings using a textblock made of “watermarked”
                paper following Marc Smith’s collation.</p>

    <p>The text of BnF Ms. Fr. 640 was written some time in the late sixteenth
        or early seventeenth century in a blank book, and its leaves have been
        preserved in a tooled leather-bound volume dating from the first half of
        the seventeenth century. The manuscript was bound in this form after the
        binder cut its spine folds and remargined each leaf, creating new
        gatherings in place of the original bifolia. In her introductory essay,
        Pamela H. Smith describes the material form of the volume and the
        textual and material evidence for the author-practitioner’s intention in
        creating the manuscript, likely compiling existing notes and recipes
        into a continuous text in this codex form.<a href="#fn1"

           role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> In studying the manuscript as a
        physical object, a modern reader is several steps removed from the
        actions of this creator in putting pen to paper: leaves excised from the
        original binding, formed into new dimensions through the extension of
        the margins, bound into a new volume with different characteristics,
        and, for many of its readers, studied only through digital images. What
        can we predict about the form of the original binding, and how might
        those predictions contribute to our understanding of the writing
        process, and through it, this text?</p>
    <h2 id="evidence-provided-by-the-paper">Evidence Provided by the Paper</h2>
    <p>Although the leaves from the book’s earlier binding have been separated
        from one another, evidence remains of the manuscript’s former state. Two
        studies of the physical book provide substantial information about the
        provenance of this work and the form it held when the text of Ms. Fr.
        640 was written in its pages. The watermark study conducted by Marc
        Smith has elucidated the relationship of the conjoint leaves. This
        masterful study of the book’s collation, using only the evidence of the
        relative placement of the watermarks, achieves the recreation of the
        connections between the formerly conjoint leaves, and thus the makeup of
        the quires.<a href="#fn2"

        Bibliothèque nationale de France.<a href="#fn4"

        now fol. 170v, that was later rebound into a gold-tooled leather binding
        fit for a nobleman’s library and decorated with his arms.</p>
    <p>The creation of the original account book began with its paper. The
        leaves of Ms. Fr. 640 consistently bear the watermark of Nicolas Lebé
        (1550–1605),<a href="#fn5"

        the use of a paper was not limited to the area of its production.</p>
    <p>When Ms. Fr. 640 was rebound for Philippe de Béthune, the spine folds
        were trimmed, and the individual leaves were guarded and remargined with
        new paper (<i><u>Vid. 1</u></i>). As Marc Smith points out, the added
        margins would allow the book to be trimmed after re-sewing and would
        also provide the means for making a volume the same height as others on
        a shelf.<a href="#fn13"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref13"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> Trimming, or ploughing, a book’s
        edges after sewing was an expected step in any finished inboard binding
        during the hand press period and would have been a necessary prelude to
        gilding the textblock’s edges. Books began to be shelved upright in
        libraries during the sixteenth century, and the preference of some book
        collectors for books of regular height after this transition has been
        documented: Samuel Pepys recorded in his diary in January 1665 that he
        had directed for the spines of the books in his library to be
        gold-tooled in a uniform manner; one year later he installed bookcases
        for his library that incorporated wooden blocks serving to elevate the
        smaller books on the shelves to a uniform height with the taller ones,
        and he further had these blocks gilded to match the spines of the books
        on the shelves.<a href="#fn14"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref14"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> In addition to preserving the
        edges of the original manuscript leaves when the rebound volume was
        ploughed, and potentially unifying the dimensions of a bound work within
        a shelved collection, remargining was a common practice that could be
        used to address damage to text leaves, to provide space for marginal
        annotations, and to enlarge page dimensions when, in the later
        seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, “large paper” became synonymous
        with luxury.</p>

    <p>In spite of the actions on the part of the manuscript’s
        seventeenth-century binder that have eradicated evidence of the previous
        binding, simply knowing that the leaves were contained in a stationery
        binding provides important information. In the world of book production
        in the hand press period, the binding of blank books to be used for
        writing formed a separate line of the trade from bindings of printed
        books.<a href="#fn15"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref15"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> In France, as elsewhere in
        Europe at this time, printed books were frequently sold in unbound
        sheets, and they would be bound by <em>relieurs-doreurs de livres</em>
        (binders and gilders of books) through a series of steps. These included
        folding and beating the unbound printed sheets with a hammer to reduce
        type impressions; supplying endsheets; sewing; rounding and backing (<i><u>Fig. 1</u></i>); ploughing to trim the textblock edges, which
        might then be colored or decorated; working endbands; often–though not
        always–preparing and lacing on boards of wood or paper board; covering;
        and possibly finishing with tooling and other decorative techniques.</p>

    <p>In contrast, stationery bindings, which are formed of bound quires of
        blank paper and prepared for use as account books, music manuscripts,
        and notebooks, could be made by <em>marchands-papetiers</em>
        (stationers), who also sold materials such as inks, writing implements,
        prepared parchment, and blank paper in sheets. Stocks of blank paper
        sheets would be formed into quires by gathering a specific number (four,
        five, or six were common gatherings), folding them in half and sewing
        through them. Alternatively, an individual handmade sheet of paper could
        be folded multiple times to create a four- or eight-leaf quire, as the
        outer folded edges would be trimmed off in later stages of binding. A
        twentieth-century textbook on stationery binding instructs that the
        weight of the paper itself must be a determining factor in how many
        leaves are used to form a gathering, with fewer sheets per gathering
        when the paper is thickest.<a href="#fn16"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref16"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> This sensible guideline balances
        the need for robust sections, so that paper will resist tearing against
        the sewing thread, with the need for fluid motion and flat opening that
        thicker sections might not afford to the binding. Though textual
        evidence of stationers’ methods of practice in earlier periods is
        lacking, such considerations are likely to have similarly influenced
        their choice of how many bifolia would be used to form a section.
        Statutes of 1599 and 1660 for the <em>papetiers</em> in Paris
        established that these merchants, though they were not master
        bookbinders, were permitted to bind books if they did not round them (<i><u>Fig. 2</u></i>), but left them with unrounded spines (<em>dos
            quarré</em>) (<i><u>Fig. 3</u></i>).<a href="#fn17"

        roles implied by these statutes, individual practitioners might in fact

    <p>Knowledge of the characteristics of a stationery binding may support
        certain assumptions about the original binding of Ms. Fr. 640. When a
        book is destined to be used for writing or drawing upon, it is desirable
        for the binding to manifest certain qualities. The spine will ideally
        open easily, because restraint in this area will cause the leaves to
        flex more, making it difficult to write evenly, and will reduce access
        to the full page in the area of the gutter. Spines that are not heavily
        rounded therefore usually have an advantage in being able to open easily
        and fully. A durable binding that will withstand frequent use would also
        be desirable, so that parchment, an animal skin that could be prepared
        with a tough surface, was often chosen to cover ordinary blank books. A
        style that became closely associated with stationery bindings employed a
        parchment or leather cover that had leather bands affixed across the
        spine via decorative lacing (<i><u>Fig. 4</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 5</u></i>). It utilized tackets to attach the sewn textblock to the cover (<i><u>Fig. 6</u></i>). This style, often referred to as a “ledger
        binding,” was in use by the early fifteenth century and continued
        through the mid-nineteenth century.<a href="#fn19"

    <p>Many other stationery binding styles utilized parchment as a cover (<i><u>Fig. 7</u></i>) that could be laced or tacketed onto a textblock
        and could also be internally reinforced using cartonnage or boards. In
        its simplest form, less time is required to bind a book with a limp
        parchment cover, because it can be easily folded to fit the textblock
        and laced on using the slips of the sewing supports. For reasons of
        strength and economy, parchment was frequently used to cover stationery
        bindings of all kinds—to the extent that the stationery binders of
        London came to be known as “Vellum Binders.”<a href="#fn20"

        with folds or a flap that will enclose the textblock’s edge when the
        book is not in use, thus offering more protection if it is carried about

        Claude Vignon (1593–1670), notably his depictions of <em>St. Jerome in

    <p>There are certainly many surviving leather-bound and decoratively-tooled
        stationery bindings that are structurally similar to bindings found on
        printed books of the same date (<i><u>Fig. 9</u></i>). Without any
        physical evidence, it is impossible to say that Ms. Fr. 640 was not
        originally bound in a leather-covered binding such as might have been
        produced for sale by a French stationer in the sixteenth century. For
        example, the inventory in the 1557 will of Jehan Le Charron, a
        <em>marchand-papetier</em> of Paris, included about 500 blank books
        bound in parchment and an unspecified but apparently smaller number of
        blank books <em>“reliés en bazenne verte et rouge”</em> (bound in green
        and red <em>basil,</em> a thin tanned sheepskin).<a href="#fn22"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref22"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a> However, the images of Ms. Fr.
        640 show that none of the edges of the inlaid manuscript leaves at the
        beginning and end of the textblock bear any signs of the staining that
        often offsets from the turn-ins of leather on the inside of a book’s
        cover.<a href="#fn23"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref23"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a> For comparison, some staining
        from the turn-ins of the current binding is clearly visible in Ms. Fr.
        640’s front and rear flyleaves and even continues to be visible far
        enough into the textblock to be seen on the lower added-paper margin of
        fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/170r/f/170r/tl"><u>170r</u></a>–<a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/170v/f/170v/tl"><u>v</u></a>.
        If similar staining were present on the original manuscript leaves, it
        would indicate that a previous binding was of leather, but its absence
        leaves us less certain, as staining from the turn-ins does not always
        occur. Furthermore, there may have been blank endleaves that were not
        retained in the new binding and these could have protected the surviving
        text leaves from staining. The fact that a choice was made to rebind the
        manuscript might help to support an assumption that the earlier binding
        was undecorated and ordinary, since a sumptuous gold-tooled leather
        binding would be less likely to be discarded when the book changed hands
        than a plain parchment one. However, in the case of an owner such as
        Philippe de Béthune, the opportunity to rebind it in the style of the
        other books in his library and with his arms might lead to the
        replacement of even a rather highly-decorated original binding.</p>

    <p>Thus, the style of the earlier binding of Ms. Fr. 640 cannot be known
        with any certainty, and there are many possibilities. Manuscripts from
        France dating from this period in the collections of the Columbia
        University Libraries serve to illustrate stationery bindings and their
        opening and handling characteristics. The laced-case limp parchment
        binding of Smith Western Add. Ms. 9 (<i><u>Fig. 10</u></i>), is a
        compelling example that is relevant to Ms. Fr. 640 for several reasons.
        Like Ms. Fr. 640, it is a stationery binding containing a manuscript
        compilation of entries, in this case of mathematical and astronomical
        texts and figures, and it dates from roughly the same presumed period,
        1586–87.<a href="#fn24"

        these leaves are also in folio format and the handmade paper sheets were
        gathered in sets of five or six sheets to create the sewn sections. On
        one of the leaves, the writer of SW Add. Ms. 9 has used the technique of

    <p>An assessment of SW Add. Ms. 9 as a potential model for the original
        binding of Ms. Fr. 640 is supported by several features of its current
        binding that are consistent with a date and place of origin in France in
        the later sixteenth century. SW Add. Ms. 9 was bound by sewing on four
        single alum-tawed thongs. While double supports are most common in
        bindings of the fifteenth and early sixteenth century, the occurrence of
        single supports on French limp parchment bindings grows in frequency
        through the sixteenth century.<a href="#fn26"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref26"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a> The number of sewing supports
        used to sew a book is influenced by many factors: geography, the date of
        the binding, level of economy, and format. In Nicholas Pickwoad’s survey
        of sixteenth-century French printed books in the Ramey collection, of
        the books larger than 200 mm, eighty percent were sewn on four supports
        rather than three.<a href="#fn27"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref27"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a> The textblock of SW Add. Ms. 9
        was sewn “all-along,” that is, not abbreviated by the binder in ways
        that had emerged earlier in the sixteenth century as economical
        shortcuts, to either bypass sewing stations (points where the sewing
        thread emerges from the spine fold to wrap around the support), or to
        sew multiple sections using one length of thread by switching between
        sections at the point when the thread emerges from the spine. These
        techniques were normal by the late sixteenth century on French printed
        books: results from the Ramey survey showed that all-along sewing was
        extremely rare among books printed in the 1590’s and that sewn
        textblocks in wrappers—those not bound in boards—were more commonly sewn
        using abbreviated techniques.<a href="#fn28"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref28"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a> Because comparable studies have
        not been undertaken of French stationery bindings of the sixteenth
        century, it is not possible to determine the rate at which all-along
        sewing might have been more frequently used than in printed books, but
        more robust structures remained common in stationery bindings. Dudin’s
        eighteenth-century French treatise on bookbinding attests to this need,
        as well as the requirement for ease of opening, specifying that leaves
        of the ledger bindings, or <em>reliures de Lyon,</em> must be “attached
        very securely, yet in such a manner that the Book opens very easily and
        far into the gutter, and to achieve this the side where it is sewn must
        be flat….”<a href="#fn29"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref29"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
    <p>The endbands and cover features of SW Add. Ms. 9 are similarly
        appropriate to a stationery binding from France in this period. A binder
        forms endbands at the head and tail of the book’s spine using a needle
        to take thread through the centers of some or all of the folds of the
        leaves, linking from one to the next, usually while wrapping around a
        core material. In medieval European bookbinding, the slips or extensions
        of the endband core reinforced the attachment of the boards by lacing
        through them in various ways. By the early sixteenth century, binders
        had begun cutting off endband slips so they did not extend beyond the
        spine onto the boards, but during this period they were still commonly
        used to attach parchment covers.<a href="#fn30"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref30"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a> The endbands of SW Add. Ms. 9
        are formed in a typical style for limp parchment bindings: the sewing
        threads are worked over a core of alum-tawed skin, and the slips of the
        core are used to lace through the book’s cover. The parchment used to
        cover SW Ms. Add. 9 is plain skin, presumably from a sheep. Extensions
        of the covers folded at the fore-edge would once have covered about one
        third to one half of the textblock edge when the book was closed. Now
        their presence is easily overlooked because the parchment has shrunk
        significantly, and the cover with its extensions unfolded and flat just
        manages to cover the textblock. The cover was fitted with a pair of
        fore-edge ties made of alum-tawed skin. Attachment techniques used to
        affix ties are quite varied, and this example matches the type
        designated in the Ramey survey as “Type 2” (<i><u>Fig. 12</u></i>) in
        its variation for narrower turn-ins, a style that appeared most
        frequently on Paris imprints, but was not limited to that location.<a

        Physical Form of the Binding and the Researcher’s Experience</h2>
    <p>Exploring the question of Ms. Fr. 640’s format at the time of writing may
        enhance understanding of the author-practitioner’s project in
        unpredictable ways. Consideration of the manuscript’s origins in what
        has been identified as a reused account book highlights the familiarity
        with accounting present in the manuscript itself. The entries for
        “Merchant” (fols. <a

        discuss bookkeeping and the various books used to keep accounts. In this
        context it may be relevant that the folding technique explained in <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/19v/f/19v/tl"><u>19v</u></a>
        is also frequently seen in account books, where it has been employed to
        create vertical columns, in addition to the use for ruling in
        mathematical figures discussed by the author-practitioner. Debuiche and
        Muñoz have traced the connections between Ms. Fr. 640 and the Ouvrier
        family of merchants in Toulouse.<a href="#fn32"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref32"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a> The author-practitioner’s access
        to an account book and choice to document accounting practices provoke
        curiosity, particularly in light of Ms. Fr. 640’s omission of recipes
        for making writing ink and many other mundane aspects of the physical
        process of creating texts.</p>
    <p>What is lacking when one reads a text divorced from its original binding?
        The sensory experience of handling a book contributes to an
        understanding of the text in its historic and social context.
        Christopher Clarkson wrote of the “multiple and separate components” of
        the codex book:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Combined these form numerous subtleties of historical interest and
            theoretical evidences, indicating period fashion and provenance;
            divided, they lose much of their meaning and power to conjure human
            thought…What needs most to be preserved of the physical aspect of an
            historic object is the inexplicable, the spontaneous and the
            unconscious qualities inherent in the particular age…<a href="#fn33"

    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>When a reader handles Ms. Fr. 640, the
        aural, visual, and tactile qualities of the original paper and ink may
        still be discernible, but the motion of the leaves and flexibility of
        the cover will be altered by its later binding (which in itself has a
        place in the manuscript’s history, about which it conveys its own
        messages). In using digital images for access to the text, the actions
        of navigating the text and the original direct relationships of the page
        images to one another no longer exist in the ways they did in the
        earlier bound volume. The visual language of the original cover
        materials and endsheets, which could inform a reader about the place
        this volume held in an economic hierarchy of books, is lost.
        Importantly, the evidence the binding might have provided to link the
        book with specific owners or bookbinders, possibly helping to elucidate
        the author-practitioner’s identity, is not available. Appreciation of
        the role of the book’s physical format in influencing the arrangement
        and confluence of entries is less immediate.</p>
    <p>Though it could not address every aspect of these challenges, the
        Columbia University Libraries Conservation Laboratory produced a model
        of Smith Western Add. Ms. 9’s binding using a textblock made of
        “watermarked” paper following Marc Smith’s collation, for Making and
        Knowing Project participants to consider together with the evolving
        components of the Digital Critical Edition of Ms. Fr. 640 (<i><u>Fig. 13</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 14</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 15</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 16</u></i>). Any attempt to recreate the lost structure of
        Ms. Fr. 640 by relating it to the binding of SW Add. Ms. 9 could only
        ever attain the status of an educated guess. Nevertheless, the exercise
        of seeking to understand the book’s earlier binding demands engagement
        with the social and economic context of blank books in sixteenth- and
        seventeenth-century France, and thus offers the opportunity to
        appreciate an additional aspect of the author-practitioner’s intentions,
        actions, and experience in creating the manuscript by choosing to write
        it within a bound volume.</p>
