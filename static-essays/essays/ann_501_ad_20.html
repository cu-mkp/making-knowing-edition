            <p>Andrew Lacey and Siân Lewis spent two weeks in spring 2015 with
                the Making and Knowing Project leading students in lifecasting
                experiments. In their essay, they provide an account of Lacey’s
                experimentation and analysis of lifecasting techniques in
                advance of the Making and Knowing Residency, the real-time x-ray
                videos of metal casting they produced, and the whirlwind of
                Making and Knowing Lab activity in spring 2015.</p>

    <p>Some time ago, the poet Alice Oswald asked if she and I could talk around
        the material culture of the “bronze age,” specifically of the heroic
        Greek period that she was researching at that time for “Memorial,” her
        epic re-imagining of Homer’s <em>Iliad</em>. This conversation covered
        everything from copper mining and smelting to the shaping and forming of
        bronze sculptures, all the way through to how the infamous flame-shaped
        sword favored by the Greeks felt like in the hand. We became aware that
        this conversation provided a back door into the past that allowed her to
        imagine her way into what could not be sensed directly. Since then, I
        have used this process to help me in the experimental reconstruction of
        objects or recipes from history (<i><u>Fig. 1</u></i>). Simultaneously
        allowing me to explore landscapes of the past while witnessing from the
        present has created an experience of time travel. I applied this method
        in reading Ms. Fr. 640 which revealed an astonishing vivification of
        seventeenth century life, a rich weaving of every concern and inquiry
        emerging from the landscape of southern France. Through deeper reading
        of the text, it was possible to sense the seasons through the
        descriptions of animals and flowers listed in the volume, and, when
        remembering the smell of wax and pine resin in my studio, I imagined the
        landscape of Toulouse. My explorations of the manuscript followed this
        indirect route of the imagination through the lens of “maker” and my own
        practical workshop knowledge; I later dissected this vision with the
        tools of scientific analysis.</p>

    <p>In 2014, I was invited to join the Making and Knowing project in the role
        of “Expert Maker,” a curious title that suggests perhaps too much. This
        invitation gave me the opportunity to engage with the unknown
        author-practitioner in a form of “time-distanced” conversation. The aim
        was to explore the lifecasting recipes within Ms. Fr. 640 and, if
        possible, to experimentally reconstruct them with a view to better
        understand the materials and processes therein. By some degree of
        serendipity I had also been asked to create a lifecast lizard for the
        new Enlightenment Galleries in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London.
        Such alignment in the constellations is rare, and the combination of the
        V&amp;A’s art commission with Making and Knowing Project’s theoretical
        experimental reconstruction was too good to be missed, thus I spent the
        summer of 2014 reading and imagining my way into the manuscript.
        Although I made many lifecasting experiments during this time, few were
        recorded (<i><u>Fig. 2</u></i>).</p>

    <p>What follows describes one experiment that asks questions of the
        author-practitioner while reflecting back physical realizations thrown
        up by the experiment. It also hints at the author-practitioner’s habit
        of self-questioning and realignments, a point brought to light in Giulia
        Chiostrini and Jef Palframan’s essay “Molding a Rose.”<a href="#fn1"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref1"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> The essayists also recognize the
        author-practitioner’s method of using practice as a guide to
        understanding and refining each recipe. In this same manner, I set out
        to use reconstructive analysis to challenge the author-practitioner’s
        observations and my own preconceived ideas on life casting.</p>

        Interrogating the Recipe for Molding and Casting a Lizard</h3>
    <p>The author-practitioner gives great attention to the capturing of
        lizards, and on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/111v/f/111v/tl"><u>111v</u></a>
        suggests “When one takes them with two&nbsp;fingers&nbsp;from the sides
        of the head, at the level of the ears, one makes them open their mouth,
        then one takes the&nbsp;end of its lower mandible and next, with the
        upper mandible, he bites the&nbsp;nail, but he cannot pass through, but
        he clenches very strongly. And if he were to bite
        living&nbsp;flesh&nbsp;it would&nbsp;not let go, and there would be no
        better remedy than to promptly cut off his head.&nbsp;In the spring, as
        they have changed skin, they are more beautiful.” Next the
        author-practitioner moves on to killing and preserving the lizard: “put
        it to death in this way. Place it in a&nbsp;clean bottle or
        vessel&nbsp;so that it would collect no dust. And put inside such a
        quantity of&nbsp;good vinegar&nbsp;and urine&nbsp;that it can be
        covered. And shake it and torment it therein until it is dead, which
        will be in&nbsp;an hour or a half.” Thankfully in both instances, I did
        not have to carry out these actions. The sample lizard used for the
        experiment was a Bearded Dragon and acquired from a pet shop, where,
        after a short and awkward conversation, the owner revealed they had a
        dead lizard that had been gifted to a school and returned deceased. The
        school in their care and wisdom had managed to forget to feed it over
        the summer holidays, hence it became the unexpected participant of the
        experiment. Specifically, the Bearded Dragon is a denizen of the
        southern hemisphere not a native of Britain, but lizards are a protected
        species and choice was limited, so the Bearded Dragon passed muster (<i><u>Fig. 3</u></i>).</p>

        the recipe goes on to describe how the lizard is placed on a flat slab
        of clay (of an almond shape), and posed in an interesting and
        naturalistic manner: “Thus, the head will be held high, which will have
        better grace, and being secured, next, arrange the gesture of the body
        and the feet and the entanglement as you think will look best.” My
        lizard’s appearance was dictated by its last pose in life, after which
        it was frozen, in a state of rigor mortis. It had clearly suffered from
        starvation and with its sagging body creating folds of skin, it still
        appeared beautiful in death (<i><u>Fig. 4</u></i>).</p>

    <p>Next, a wall of clay was made to surround the lizard, with a shorter
        section arranged toward the area where the gate will be formed.
        Surprisingly, this arrangement for molding was something I still use
        today when making molds for both wax and metal casts. In fact, I became
        aware of many instances where descriptions of practices from the past
        are still in use today. This long reach back in time reveals continuity
        of transmission covering centuries, whether oral, textual or from
        practice. However, the next stage challenged my received wisdom and
        current workshop practice. The author-practitioner clearly states
        directing the flow of the metal via the gate and into the body of the
        animal, as visualized in the margin of fols. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/115r/f/115r/tl"><u>115r</u></a>
        and <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/124v/f/124v/tl"><u>124v</u></a>,
        through the tail. I consulted my peers (other founders, scientists, and
        makers) on this feature, and the universal conclusion was that it was
        wrong. The received wisdom today suggests that, when metal is fed into a
        body like this, the widest part of the form (in this case the belly)
        should be used. The rationale follows that when the liquid metal enters
        the mold, the largest parts of the cast will radically contract on
        cooling, therefore if the body is fed directly, then any contraction
        will be preferentially directed toward the gate instead. This fact is
        true but highlights my first mistake and some of the conflict the work
        of reconstructing past processes creates when viewed from a
        twenty-first-century perspective. My attitude toward casting was focused
        on metallurgical concerns, i.e., that of flow and contraction, however
        the author-practitioner’s concerns lay in preserving the aesthetics of
        the animal, hence he used the tail as the point through which the mold
        is filled. Molding in this way suggests that the author-practitioner’s
        control of the process was highly attuned to the physical demands and
        complexities of the materials. Seen elsewhere in the manuscript, the
        practice of casting via the smallest and most discreet entry point, as
        with the stems of flowers or tail of crayfish, indicates the
        universality of his technological principle.</p>
    <p>I now arranged the gate and sprues, in this case, erroneously toward the
        head and body of the lizard (<i><u>Fig. 5</u></i>). However, the general
        design for the sprue system follows the author-practitioner’s advice in
        creating a comprehensive direction of flow throughout the whole mold.
        Put in simple terms, the liquid metal flows first into the gate where it
        divides into three streams, then enters the body of the lizard. In
        theory, the metal then flows through the entire lizard, exiting via the
        limbs and out through the smaller vents that surround it, simultaneously
        venting off any combustion gases, steam or air that have evolved in the
        mold. As we will see later, this idea of metal flow is over-simplified
        but it still represents the way we tend to visualize the unseen fluid
        dynamics in the casting process. It is worth noticing that the
        author-practitioner alters the rather staccato design for the gating of
        the sprue system, first visualized on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/124v/f/124v/tl"><u>124v</u></a>
        by then changing to the gate design on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/125r/f/125r/tl"><u>125r</u></a>,
        with the more recognizable fluidity of the funnel divided into three
        fine feeds.</p>

        </figure>
    </div>
    <p>My second challenge to the author-practitioner was to question whether
        the wax sprue system he specified could be substituted by one of clay,
        the premise being that if the mold is designed to be opened, then why
        not remove the clay sprue and lizard then. The problem with this, as we
        shall see, became apparent later. Note the close attention to the claws,
        where very fine sprues connect the outer tips of the claw to other
        nearby elements, such as the tail or body, further enabling the flow of
        metal.</p>
    <p>Now, having arranged everything and not forgetting the wetting agent, I
        poured in the plaster investment, following the instructions “And as
        soon as you have thus moistened everything with&nbsp;eau-de-vie, cast in
        your&nbsp;wetted sand&nbsp;without letting the&nbsp;eau-de-vie&nbsp;dry,
        which evaporates promptly” (<i><u>Fig. 6</u></i>). Again, the recipes
        and proportions for making plaster investment are very similar to those
        today. In fact I use a near exact version of this recipe with brick dust
        replaced by molochite powder or very finely sifted dry sand, and
        exchanging “feathered alum” for chopped glass fiber. The eau-de-vie was
        new to me and worked wonderfully in allowing the liquid plaster to
        penetrate the finest details of the scales.</p>

    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>With the mold now facing upward, it was
        again ringed with clay as before, creating a hollow that will become the
        bottom half of the mold. It is worthy of consideration that the plaster,
        a liquid, changes viscosity over a short time and soon begins to
        stiffen, eventually hardening into a solid block. This principle can be
        used to one’s advantage in this part of the process. When first mixed
        with water, the plaster is highly fluid, and, if poured or flicked onto
        the lizard first, will capture the finest features of the scales. As the
        plaster becomes more viscous, it traps air bubbles in its matrix, but
        crucially away from the surface of the lizard, forming a porous body
        which later will enable moisture to be released from the mold and
        casting gases to be expelled in exchange for metal. The
        author-practitioner however has a cautionary note on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/133v/f/133v/tl"><u>133v</u></a>
        stating that porosity “readily comes about when you cast two or
        three&nbsp;small molds, one after the other, in the same&nbsp;bowl, for
        the last one is cast from the bottom and thickest [sand] of
        the&nbsp;bowl, which readily becomes porous. The thinnest [sand] casts
        more finely and more neatly, provided that one blows strongly enough
        when casting on the tempered and cast&nbsp;sand&nbsp;in order to
        dissipate these small bubbles.”</p>
    <p>On opening the mold the second time (<i><u>Fig. 9</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 10</u></i>), I had hoped that the clay sprues and lizard would
        be compliant enough to allow for their removal. The author-practitioner
        on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/114v/f/114v/tl"><u>114v</u></a>
        recommends “extract gently and with patience and method, the half of the
        animal remaining in one of the&nbsp;molds,&nbsp;pulling it sometimes
        from one side and sometimes from the other, to avoid breaking any of it,
        or also spoiling something from the&nbsp;mold.” However, on
        investigation I sensed that pulling the body of the lizard would disrupt
        the mold, fracturing the smaller plaster elements of the mold holding it
        tight; therefore I chose to leave the lizard in the mold with no
        expectation of its reuse. The clay sprues came out with ease but to get
        the channels clear required washing out all the fine sediment,
        introducing more moisture to the mold at a time when the mold needs to
        dry.</p>

    <p>The mold was ready for firing, first to dry it out, then to heat it until
        the lizard body turns to ash. The same would apply to any fully embedded
        animal or plant. On fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/115r/f/115r/tl"><u>115r</u></a>,
        we are directed to “Reheat the thickest part, where the body of the
        animal is, at the top, so that, if there is something inside to burn, it
        falls to the bottom.” A key question here would be, how long is the mold
        fired for? In my gas kiln it is difficult to see exactly what is going
        on inside and the usual indicators of flame color, smoke, and smell have
        to be sensed at a distance. It is through the senses rather than
        pyrometers and time charts that I gauge how best to navigate these
        invisible processes.</p>
    <p>Once cooled and removed from the kiln, in opening the fired mold, we are
        presented with a starkly different vision than before, but one that is
        promising. Where the body of the lizard once was, are now the cremated
        remains (<i><u>Fig. 11</u></i>). Fine bones have calcined to a pure
        white matrix and, despite looking solid, they can be blown away with a
        breath (<i><u>Fig. 12</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 13</u></i>). This advice is
        important, for any debris left inside the mold could cause a defect in
        the casting.</p>

            they make two errors: the first, that&nbsp;quicksilver&nbsp;by its

            the other, that some grains will always linger inside that will

            is true that if it is to empty the&nbsp;of some animal which is
            thickish and which has big conduits and passages by which
            the&nbsp;quicksilver&nbsp;can easily exit, like a&nbsp;bird&nbsp;or

    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>Thankfully, I chose to use the breath and
        just blow out any remains.</p>
    <p>The mold was then reassembled and bound with fine iron wires, then
        returned to the kiln for a second firing, this time aiming to get the
        interior of the mold glowing red hot. While it was heating, a small
        crucible of bronze (90% copper, 10% tin) was heated in a charcoal
        hearth, taking half an hour to fully melt and become completely fluid.
        The mold was removed from the kiln, and, while still glowing inside, was
        placed in some sandy earth to hold it in position. Dross was removed
        from the top of the bronze with an iron tool, and the mirror-like bronze
        was poured into the mold. I noted that no smoke or smells were emitted
        from the mold when the metal entered, a good sign that no debris lay
        hidden inside the mold (<i><u>Fig. 14</u></i>).</p>

    <p>The heat of both the firing and the molten metal had taken a toll on the
        mold (<i><u>Fig. 15</u></i>). When cool enough to touch, the plaster
        investment broke away with ease, crumbling to a fine powder. The bronze
        cast fell out of this mass of dusty material and revealed some degree of
        damage caused by the mold cracking (<i><u>Fig. 16</u></i>). The long
        outer sprue, the vent designed to carry the gases away, had suffered the
        most, but this was superficial as these vents would be cut away from the
        lizard and returned to the crucible. On the underside of the cast, small
        flashings of metal where the bronze had entered cracks looked dramatic
        but in reality either broke away or chipped off with ease (<i><u>Fig. 17</u></i>). <i><u>Fig. 18</u></i> shows the level of detail
        achieved, and the shiny lines describe where the thin metal flashings
        have been filed away.</p>

    <p>The author-practitioner says surprisingly little on the subject of
        cleaning and refining the casting (<i><u>Fig. 19</u></i>). Apart from
        the necessity of removing the sprues and gate, this silence possibly
        assumes that only the most successful casts would be used and the
        complexity of rectifying failure was best achieved by re-casting. The
        author-practitioner also does not discuss the need to artificially color
        the casting; I assume this is because he intended that the cast would
        simply reveal the beauty of the once living animal and its miraculous
        transformation into the enduring permanence of the metal (<i><u>Fig. 20</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 21</u></i>).</p>

    <h2 id="imagining-the-invisible-imaging-the-invisible">Imagining the
        Invisible / Imaging the Invisible </h2>
    <p>Just prior to my 2015 visit to the Making and Knowing Lab, I had the
        chance to revisit the question I had posed early on, as to why the
        author-practitioner had chosen to place the gate and main feeds into the
        smallest elements of the animal or flower. This principle repeated
        throughout the recipes of Ms. Fr. 640 confounded me. I had seen so many
        examples of casts failing due to the misplacement (as I would judge it)
        of the gating system. The complications surrounding the flow and
        subsequent cooling and contraction often resulted in casting flaws that
        defied repair. However, the perseverance of the author-practitioner
        persuaded me that there must be value in this method. I devised an
        experiment to cast a perfect wax copy of the proto-lizard, as per the
        recipe and then analyse it using twenty-first century methods. In order
        to maximize the value and credibility of this experiment I needed to be
        able to see inside the mold as the cast happened. To do this required
        accessing a real-time x-ray facility designed specifically for analysing
        fluid dynamics of casting systems, and, as luck would have it, there is
        one such facility within three hours drive of my studio. The Department
        of Metallurgy in Birmingham University, UK, is still one of the most
        highly regarded departments in this field, albeit one that has changed
        beyond description over the last thirty years due to the development of
        new technologies. It was here that the following experiments took place.
    </p>
    <p>Both experimental sprue systems featured the same wax lizard model as a
        standard form so that the variation in the sprue system (tail-fed vs.
        head-fed) would be the only difference. The first experimental sprue
        system approximately followed the author-practitioners diagram in the
        margins of fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/124v/f/124v/tl"><u>124v</u></a>
        with the main gate and feeds directed toward the tail of the lizard (<i><u>Fig. 22</u></i>). The second sprue system followed common modern
        art foundry practice with the main flow of liquid directed toward the
        bulk of the body and head (<i><u>Fig. 23</u></i>).</p>

    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>I would also like to draw attention to the
        gate, which is a point repeated in words and sketches throughout the
        sections in the manuscript on lifecasting. The author-practitioner
        writes “Be careful to not make your gate very wide, and do not forget to
        make in its conduit two or three holes and notches, and as your gate
        approaches the&nbsp;molded thing, divide it into three or four parts
        like&nbsp;fingers&nbsp;which are pointed and are not very deep. For
        the&nbsp;metal&nbsp;runs more gently without being hindered by vapors
        and fumes” (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/129v/f/129v/tl"><u>129v</u></a>).
        The gate or funnel divided into three feeds was still in common use in
        England’s art foundries until the late twentieth century, and I had also
        seen evidence of it on the underside of sculptures by Degas in the
        Fitzwilliam Museum’s collection. Here again is a remnant of practice
        encoded and transmitted over centuries. Two details strike me about
        these repeated instructions: first, the author-practitioner understood
        how the evolving gases inside the mold could disrupt the flow of the
        metal, therefore providing alternative channels through which the metal
        could flow to avoid choking the mouth of the mold. Second, by notching
        the lower section of the gate, dross would hopefully be caught in the
        roughened texture, as typically most dross is deposited close to the
        bottom of the gate just prior to entering the cast.</p>
    <p>Both molds were de-waxed and fired before being transported to Birmingham
        University. On site, both molds were placed in a kiln and fired to 450°C
        for two hours; the bronze used was of the same composition as previously
        (90% copper, 10% tin). The real-time x-ray machine is part of a heavily
        insulated room-sized chamber with an x-ray gun to one side and a target
        on the other. The mold was carefully placed between said gun and target,
        then an image of the mold could be viewed from an adjacent room. The
        viewable image showed the maximum area visible by the x-rays. The molten
        bronze was poured remotely on a massively over-engineered articulated
        arm. The complexity of setting the mold and crucible, vacating the
        chamber, firing the x-ray, and managing to capture the video images in
        an adjacent room was, if not balletic, highly impressive! The bronze,
        poured at a temperature of 1150°C, could clearly be seen filling the
        empty mold, revealing its secrets at 25 frames per second (<i><u>Fig. 24</u></i>). Both molds were cast within a short time of each
        other and under exactly the same physical conditions.</p>

    <p>Any subsequent differences in the casts would be due to factors of flow
        and contraction. On opening the molds, both appeared to be of the same
        quality, highly detailed, and all the extremities of the lizard, as well
        as the entire sprue system, had worked perfectly. As I have witnessed
        from many other real-time x-ray experiments, this gating method also
        helped to reduce turbulence and capture fine elements of dross before
        they fully enter the mold. It also shows the ingenuity of the
        author-practitioner to imagine his way into the invisible, into what
        could not be seen directly.</p>
    <p>Review of the two real-time x-ray videos showed that in both experiments,
        the flow of the metal was highly turbulent. This caused metal to splash
        against the internal walls of the mold until the metal reached the
        halfway point whereby the flow started to rectify and become calmer.
        This is still a far cry from the idealized gentle and controlled flow we
        imagine should be happening. This visual evidence was crucial in
        examining the realities of such practice. Witnessed in the video was the
        slow expulsion of air trapped inside a raised claw that was vented
        poorly. Here we saw that metal cast into a gas permeable mold, could
        under pressure push the gases directly through the wall of the mold.
        This event could only happen if the temperature and fluidity of the
        metal worked in conjunction with the temperature and permeability of the
        mold.</p>
    <p>Later, the two casts were imaged again under standard x-ray conditions
        (120Kv with copper filter). The two casts seen side by side look very
        similar (<i><u>Fig. 25</u></i>) but on closer inspection the cast
        following the author-practitioner’s “tail-fed” instruction revealed
        hollow voids discreetly hidden within the wall of the lizard’s body (<i><u>Fig. 26</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 27</u></i>).</p>

    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>Crucially, in the case of the tail-fed
        lizard, the x-ray describes the result of the way the metal cooled
        (<i><u>Vid. 1</u></i>). The evidence shows the following: beginning
        under the true right arm of the lizard, a large void formed every few
        millimeters with increasing size and angularity along the central core
        of body, until finally stopping at the mid section between the rear legs
        and the tail, indicating the point where the metal was last liquid just
        before entering a slush phase. Although this appears as a dramatic and
        potentially disastrous flaw, if the voids do not penetrate to the outer
        surface of the casting, the flaw itself becomes invisible to the viewer
        and the casting appears perfect. It is a gamble, to cast in this way
        offers greater aesthetic value to the lizard or flower because the key
        areas, i.e., the face or head of the flower, are not disrupted by the
        imposition of larger, heavy sprues. The complexity of the physics
        balanced against the author-practitioner’s virtuosity was the balance
        between success and failure.</p>

    <p>The spring semester 2015 had finally arrived, but the warm summer scents
        of the Toulouse landscape evoked in the manuscript had been replaced by
        the whipping easterly winds of February in New York and sparkling ice
        floes on the Hudson River. The students of the Making and Knowing
        Project were now focusing on the lifecasting recipes in the manuscript
        Ms. Fr. 64 and, in the role of “Expert Maker” I would be helping them
        navigate.</p>
    <p>To see this group of incredibly bright students directed by Pamela Smith
        was something impressive to behold. One cannot overestimate the power of
        the “hive mind” and there is a potent energy in bringing a diverse range
        of minds to the same task. However, my initial concern was that having
        so many students recreating the complex and sometimes confusing recipes
        of the manuscript could result in wide-ranging errors in the
        experiments. Critically, the students did not come from a practical arts
        background, so how precise would the reconstructed experiments be, and
        what would be the value of their outcomes? My concerns were soon
        quelled, however, as I saw the way they approached each task. The
        diverse range of minds and approaches coupled with the “hive mind”
        phenomenon overcame what could have been a highly reductive process. The
        students were required to engage with the complexities of lifecasting,
        and the author-practitioner offers a wide range of recipes, including
        lizards, snakes, beetles, flowers, and even a spider web. These recipes
        tackle the casting of many natural objects, however in practice, they
        can be seen more broadly as nuanced variants of the same process. By
        setting students onto slightly differing but essentially very similar
        experimental trajectories, each student could reveal and correlate
        details that would previously have been time consuming to gather and
        difficult to explain. There is also a special phenomenon that occurs
        when a large number of novice practitioners (students) carry out the
        same task. Typically, they will all find their own route, meaning that
        success and failure were both commonplace. More significantly, the
        boundaries of each process can be found very quickly which is essential
        for understanding the parameters of any action or material given in the
        recipes. What follows are some observations made during the numerous
        experiments carried out in those two weeks in the lab.</p>
    <h3 id="two-types-of-mold">Two Types of Mold</h3>
    <p>The molding of flowers is repeatedly described within the text and
        entries appear sporadically from fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/117r/f/117r/tl"><u>117r</u></a>
        through to <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/155r/f/155r/tl"><u>155r</u></a>.
        Many of these recipes for molding flowers fall into two principal
        categories.</p>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>
            <blockquote>
                <p>a two-part mold, designed for flatter (less
                    three-dimensionally complex forms), including objects such
                    as leaves, lizards, snakes, beetles, etc. For these molds,
                    the author-practitioner suggests on fol. <a
                       href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/116r/f/116r/tl"><u>116r</u></a>,
                    “One needs to mold them as soon as they are picked because
                    they&nbsp;wilt and dry out. Dip them, therefore, immediately
                    in good eau-de-vie &amp; then put them in your tempered sand
                    mold, like snakes.”</p>
            </blockquote>
        </li>
        <li>
            <blockquote>
                <p>a one-piece mold used for molding fuller, more complex
                    objects such as roses, carnations or bouquets. This second
                    method appears less frequently in the text, and although
                    simpler in construction, provides more complexity: because
                    the object to be cast is fully encased in the mold, it
                    cannot be opened for inspection, and what happens deep
                    inside is impossible to know. In this second method we see
                    an increased danger of ash and charcoal lodging within the
                    mold, potentially causing a flaw in the casting. This is
                    perhaps why the author-practitioner does not refer to it as
                    frequently as the two-part mold.</p>
            </blockquote>

    <p>Following the two-part molding recipe for “molding a rose” on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/155r/f/155r/tl"><u>155r</u></a>,
        the stem and small branches were removed and laid onto a bed of clay
        similar to the previous lizard experiment. Simple wax sprue systems were
        designed for each leaf and stem (<i><u>Fig. 29</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 30</u></i>). To assist the flow of the metal, the
        author-practitioner suggests “And with small veins
        of&nbsp;wax&nbsp;adapted and joined from leaf to leaf, you can make
        gates.” A design for these gates can be seen in the margin, however the
        author-practitioner goes on to say “You can even make a vein
        of&nbsp;wax&nbsp;from&nbsp;the back of the first petal, which will join
        to the gate. All of this facilitates the cast” (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/155r/f/155r/tl"><u>155r</u></a>).
        This method for creating veins or gates on the reverse of a thin casting
        has frequently been used throughout history, and a good example can be
        seen in the small bronze plaquette designed by Andrea Riccio “The
        Triumph of a Hero” (<i><u>Fig. 31</u></i>). On the reverse of the
        plaquette are a series of fine lines that had been created by scoring
        channels into the back of the mold (<i><u>Fig. 32</u></i>). When
        comparing the designs for sprueing small plants and animals in the
        manuscript with Riccio’s integrated sprue system on the reverse of his
        plaquette, we see strong correlation. Further, this integrated design is
        commonly in use today for both lost-wax and sand casting of small
        objects.</p>

    <p>For casting delicate flowers and bouquets, the author-practitioner
        suggests on fols. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/117r/f/117r/tl"><u>117r</u></a>

        that they are cast upright in the vertical cylinder of clay. Here the
        design for the sprue system has been altered. The plant stem is now
        mounted on a wax “peg,” forming the main gate, supported by two smaller
        vents either side of it. Again, we see here that the instructions of the
        author-practitioner have echoed down through the centuries. This method
        of gating is so effective that it is still in use today for casting
        jewellery or small, complex sculptural objects, as seen in the two
        images from the studio of Factum Arte (<i><u>Fig. 33</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 34</u></i>). The olive branch will join other similar castings
        that will eventually create the entire bronze sculpture of an olive
        tree. The arrangement for the sprues and gate (now molded in metal) are
        very similar to the author-practitioner’s recipe. Instead of a clay
        wall, the whole system is surrounded by a steel cylinder to create the
        mold, even the investment is a derivation of the plaster-sand recipe.

    <h3 id="improbably-fine-results">Improbably Fine Results</h3>
    <p>The author-practitioner also gives useful and practical advice for
        casting flowers that are too fine to support their own weight or that
        will be susceptible to movement when the “sand” (plaster) is poured into
        the clay mold. In the margins of fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/117r/f/117r/tl"><u>117r</u></a>
        are suggestions that “If the plants are so delicate that they rise to
        the top when you pour the&nbsp;tempered sand, one can fix and contain
        them with a&nbsp;thread&nbsp;passed through the circle of
        the&nbsp;mold&nbsp;with a&nbsp;needle.” As proof of the effectiveness of
        this technique, the permeability of the mold and the flow of the metal
        resulted in the improbably fine cotton thread (<i><u>Fig. 35</u></i>)
        being integrated with the casting of the rosemary (<i><u>Fig. 36</u></i>). To cast at such a fine level is the ultimate goal, the potential
        being the ability to recreate nature in all its beauty and wonder.</p>

    <h3 id="making-the-mold-breathe">Making the Mold Breathe</h3>
    <p>The way the metal flows around the interior of a mold is critical to the
        success of the casting. As mentioned before, there are two key factors
        at play. First, the design of the sprue system should provide easy
        access for the metal to enter the finest part of the mold. Any ash from
        the burnt animal or plant will block the passage of the metal and must
        be blown out (<i><u>Fig. 37</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 38</u></i>) before any
        attempt at casting is made (<i><u>Fig. 39</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 40</u></i>).</p>

    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>Second, but more difficult to know
        directly, is the porosity of the plaster mold. The author-practitioner
        gives warning on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/146r/f/146r/tl"><u>146r</u></a>
        that large bubbles of air trapped in the plaster might get stuck to the
        surface of the object to be cast. These bubbles would later be revealed
        in the casting as fine balls of metal adhered to the surface of the cast
        object. However, what the author-practitioner could not see is the fine
        porosity that makes up the matrix of the mold (<i><u>Fig. 41</u></i>).

    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>We now know that this interlacing crystal
        structure provides plenty of space for air and casting gases to be
        removed from the system. Making the mold breathe is an issue that all
        metal founders wrestle with. The importance of this principle can be
        seen in the real-time x-ray videos (see Vid. 1), where the finest
        details seen in the claws of the lizard miraculously begin to appear and
        eventually fill up even though the sprues are completely choked with
        metal. The directions laid out in the recipes allow for this phenomenon,
        even though it is something that cannot be sensed directly, but only
        realized through the successful outcome of the casting.</p>
    <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion </h2>
    <p>In many ways, I find the voice of the author-practitioner deeply resonant
        with my own studio practice. The habit of self-correction through
        experimentation is something I find far more important than
        verbatim-learned practice. Learning through experimentation is in my
        opinion more flexible, particularly when applied to the wide range of
        possibilities that one has to contend with in the studio. Adaptability
        is central to the success of such experimentation, but it is only
        through being fully awake with our senses that we can navigate the
        unknown. The elemental forces that come with the changing of our seasons
        may be greeted as collaborators and allies. The author-practitioner is
        clearly highly adaptable, taking elements from previous recipes and
        constantly altering or challenging them until a successful outcome is
        reached. Confusingly for the reader, self-corrections sometimes occur
        over many pages with large gaps in between, making interpretation
        difficult. However, this also points to a real-time chronology of the
        text; one can sense how the author-practitioner has had to wait for an
        experiment, perhaps to let it dry out, or possibly because other
        experiments have taken precedence. I was also struck by the sense of
        continuity through the centuries that the manuscript Ms. Fr. 640 offers.
        On numerous occasions, recipes in the text appear familiar to me. The
        Riccio plaquette is evidence of the transmission of techniques through
        deep history, and Factum Arte’s <em>Bronze Olive Tree</em> links this
        lineage of ideas to state-of-the-art contemporary practice. We see in
        the author-practitioner’s words a continuum of makers that reaches from
        the long distant past, remaining unbroken for centuries, and very much
        alive today.</p>
    <p>I came across the title of this essay on a bitterly cold walk to the
        Making and Knowing Lab one day. “In Pursuit of Magic” was
        spray-stencilled on the pavement in front of a rather stylish shop in
        Greenwich Village (<i><u>Fig. 42</u></i>).</p>
