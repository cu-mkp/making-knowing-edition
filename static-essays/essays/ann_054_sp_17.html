        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <div>
            <p>Ms. Fr. 640, fol. <a
                   href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/7v/f/7v/tl"><u>7v</u></a>,
                contains a curious recipe titled “To relieve the pain of G.”
                This essay seeks to uncover the meaning of “G.” in this entry by
                comparing the recipe to three other similar entries in the
                manuscript: “Against gonorrhea,” also on fol. 7v, “Against Go.,”
                on fol. <a
                   href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/16v/f/16v/tl"><u>16v</u></a>,
                and “Against cold gouts,” on fol. <a
                   href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/46r/f/46r/tl"><u>46r</u></a>.
                Contemporary sources, including medical treatises and reference
                works, offer clues about the purpose of this recipe, mentioning
                similar ingredients and methods of preparation and application.
                Indeed, the medicinal properties of the recipe’s
                ingredients—marcasite, storax, and urine—serve specific purposes
                that can be associated with early modern conceptions of gout. A
                reconstruction of the recipe considers whether the process of
                distilling these ingredients was feasible.</p>

    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
    <p>Fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/7v/f/7v/tl"><u>7v</u></a>
        in Ms. Fr. 640 contains a recipe “To relieve the pain of G.,” which is
        followed by an entry on the same page titled “Against gonorrhea.” Fol.
        <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/16v/f/16v/tl"><u>16v</u></a>
        presents another recipe with an abbreviated title, “Against Go.” A later
        entry on fol. 46r is titled “Against cold gouts.” This essay compares
        these four recipes in order to determine the relationship among them and
        the subject of the puzzling “g.” on fol. 7v. Interestingly, while the
        two recipes on fol. 7v are written in the same hand, the first entry,
        “To relieve the pain of G.,” is in French while “Against gonorrhea”
        below it is in Latin. Could this suggest that they were copied from, or
        transmitted by, different sources? The answer, however, does not help us
        to disambiguate the meaning of “G.” Contemporary definitions of both
        gonorrhea and gout, a reconstruction of the recipe “To relieve the pain
        of G.,” and an analysis of the medicinal virtues of its ingredients help
        to answer this puzzling question.</p>
    <h2 id="gonorrhea-and-gout">Gonorrhea and Gout</h2>
    <p>The comparison among the form of these recipes yields more questions than
        answers. To begin with, it is unclear what, exactly, “G.” and “Go.”
        abbreviate—do they refer to gonorrhea? Or perhaps gout? Or another
        ailment altogether? Moreover, this appears to be a heterogeneous group
        of recipes in terms of the materials and procedures described by the
        author-practitioner. For example, the first entry on fol. 7v uses a
        distillation of “a pound of finely powdered golden and yellow marcasite,
        half an ounce of storax, 4 lb. of urine.” The subsequent entry on this
        page provides instructions on how to make an “injection” that contains
        “old smith’s water,” armenian bole “reduced in the finest powder,” and
        “common honey.” Fol. 16v is a very short entry about another injectable,
        this time made of a quince-seed infused water; fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/46r/f/46r/tl"><u>46r</u></a>
        is equally brief and instructs us to combine guaiac oil with oil of
        sulfur, “and apply.” Viewed as a whole, the first entry on fol. 7v and
        that on fol. 46r deal with how to make a topical remedy, while the other
        two entries describe injectables. Based on textual analysis and material
        considerations of the information provided in the two entries, “Against
        gonorrhea” and “Against Go.,” it is likely that the latter is indeed in
        reference to gonorrhea and not gout. However, none of the four recipes
        address the alleviation of pain apart from the oblique reference in the
        puzzling title on fol. 7v, “To relieve the pain of G.”</p>
    <p>How relevant was pain to contemporary definitions of gonorrhea and/or
        gout? Randle Cotgrave’s definition for gonorrhea in his 1611
        <em>Dictionarie of the French and English Tongues</em> provides useful
        insight: “Gonorrhée” is described as “the running of the reines;” using
        the French word, <em>reins</em>, for kidney, it characterizes gonorrhea
        as an excretion or a discharge originating in the kidneys.<a href="#fn1"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref1"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> An earlier source, Bernard de
        Gordon (c.1450–1500), provides these definitions for gonorrhea: “c’est
        emission de sperme sans volupté” (“the emission of sperm without
        sensuous pleasure”) and “Item note que toute froidure n'est pas
        <em>gonorree</em>, mais froidure intense paralitiquant” (“be aware that
        not all cold is gonorrhea, but intense paralytic cold [is]”).<a
           href="#fn2"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref2"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> These sources impart a general
        understanding of contemporary medical notions of gonorrhea, in which
        various kinds of genital discharge and the general loss of semen could
        be diagnosed as gonorrhea.<a href="#fn3"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref3"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> The author-practitioner’s recipes
        for making injections on fols. 7v (“Against gonorrhea”) and 16v
        (“Against Go.”) may relate to such localized symptoms. The former is
        clearly an entry about gonorrhea treatment, and we might assume the same
        for the latter, as they both describe preparations for injectables—the
        question remains, injections where? While neither manuscript entry
        explicitly addresses symptoms or the patient’s pain caused by this
        disease, we can imagine the discomfort in the application of this
        particular remedy.</p>
    <p>By contrast, the entry “Against cold gouts” on fol. 46r and that to
        relieve “the pain of G.” on fol. 7v do clearly point to physical
        discomfort and can be understood as a general topical palliative for a
        set of related humoral afflictions. While modern medicine understands
        gout as a form of arthritis occurring in the joints, early modern
        sources suggest a rather different understanding. According to historian
        of medicine Michael Stolberg, gout was a type of “flux,” an accumulation
        of fluid morbid matter identified by a “local and/or painful symptom.”<a
           href="#fn4"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref4"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
    <p>Pre-modern definitions of gout present a wide spectrum of complaints. In
        <em>La grande chirurgie de Guy de Chauliac</em>, a medieval French
        surgical guidebook, gout appears to be understood as synonymous with
        arthritis: “Arthretique ou goutte est douleur de joinctures engendree de
        la fluxion de humeurs aux joinctures” (<em>Arthretique</em> or gout is
        joint pain produced by the flux of humors of the joints).<a href="#fn5"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref5"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> A fifteenth-century treatise on
        bodily hygiene titled, <em>Le Regime tresutile et tresproufitable pour
            conserver et garder la santé du corps humain,</em> understands gout
        within a framework of humoral theory; here, gout is related to a
        paralyzing moisture in the body and not explicitly linked to joint
        pain.<a href="#fn6"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref6"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> The <em>Dictionnaire du Moyen
            Français</em> identifies nine different types of gout, including
        <em>Goutte colique</em> (colic gout),<a href="#fn7"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref7"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> <em>Goutte culaine</em>
        (posterior gout), <em>Goutte paralytique</em> (paralytic gout, which
        refers not to the body, but to a kind of marital ennui) and <em>Goutte
            volante</em> (flying gout).<a href="#fn8"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref8"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> Cotgrave’s entries for gout also
        emphasize localized pain as a characteristic of this ailment. He
        distinguishes six variations of gout, of which the following four
        reference specific kinds of pain: <em>Goute crampe ou, crappe</em> (“The
        Crampe; or, a Convulsion”), <em>Goutte nouée</em> (“the Gowt in any of
        the joints”), <em>Goutte serene</em> (“Blindness, or extreame dimness of
        sight, caused by obturation of the Optick Sinews”) and <em>Goutte
            Sciatique</em> (“the Sciatica; a pain, ache, or stitch in the
        hippes”). Collectively, these definitions map out a migratory path of
        pain around the gout sufferer’s body.</p>
    <p>Gout was also understood as a catchall for a variety of bodily pains.
        Stolberg affirms that gout, like other “fluxes,” was not limited to the
        joints, but “could also appear in very different body parts and could
        move from one place to another.”<a href="#fn9"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref9"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> With regard to the gout entry on
        fol. 7v, the author-practitioner does not specify for which part of the
        body this treatment is intended; he only suggests that the
        medicine-soaked cloth be applied “on the pain.” How, then, did this
        distillation recipe on fol. 7v work to alleviate gout pain?</p>
    <h2 id="marcasite-and-storax">Marcasite and Storax</h2>
    <p>Related to contemporary medical notions of the treatment of gout is the
        entry on fol. 7v:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>To relieve the pain of G.</p>
        <p>Take half a pound of finely powdered golden and yellow marcasite,
            half an ounce of storax, 4 lb. of urine, incorporate well together,
            little by little, in a mortar, then boil all together quite
            strongly. But the pot needs to be well covered so the smoke does not
            escape. Then distill the imbibed urine, separated by inclination, in
            an alembic, well luted and covered with a copper head. And soak a
            cloth with the said water and apply it lukewarm on the pain.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>Essentially this recipe is a distillation
        based on the combination of three main ingredients: the powdered golden
        and yellow marcasite, storax, and urine. Its application to the affected
        area is straightforward: a warm, wet cloth soaked in this distillate is
        directly laid upon the skin to provide pain relief. While it is not
        possible to locate the exact provenance of this recipe, Guy de
        Chauliac’s fourteenth-century surgical treatise suggests that such a
        recipe was a long-established remedy. Under the section “Of hand gout”
        (<em>De la</em> <em>chiragre</em>), Chauliac instructs to perfume the
        affected area “avec la fumée qui s’esleue du vinaigre, ietté sur la
        marcasite…. Finalement ils l’emplastrent avec du galban, et ammoniac, et
        semblables” (“with the vapor that rises off the vinegar, thrown on the
        marcasite... in the end, they plaster it with galbanum, ammoniacum, and
        the like”).<a href="#fn10"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref10"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> Though this is only one step of
        a longer recipe, it closely resembles the author-practitioner’s
        distillation entry in that it contains similar ingredients: an acid
        (vinegar), marcasite, and an aromatic gum resin (galban). Moreover, the
        physician affirms that the recipe is topical: he prefers to apply the
        remedy to the body with drenched sponges—“les esponges trempées.”<a
           href="#fn11"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref11"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> It is possible then that the
        author-practitioner’s distillation is an iteration of an established
        recipe: a concoction of an acidic liquid, marcasite and a gum resin.
        This instruction is also attributed to Chauliac’s master from Toulouse
        (<em>mon</em> <em>mestre de Tholose</em>), which leads me to wonder if
        this entry in the manuscript is a remnant or iteration of a
        long-established Toulousain gout recipe.</p>
    <p>Though the composition of this possible gout recipe is not particularly
        strange, we do not know what medicinal properties were attributed to its
        ingredients. According to the early modern barber-surgeon Ambroise Paré
        (1510–1590), gout medicines “which are made to mollifie” should have a
        “moderately heating, and humecting faculty” to dissolve the gouty
        compacted matter.<a href="#fn12"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref12"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> Does our recipe follow this same
        logic? Which elements of the recipe provide heat and which are
        humectant?</p>
    <p>In his discussion on gout, Paré suggests the use of a “repellant”
        medicine combined with a “resolving” agent. For Paré, marcasite falls
        under the category of a “repelling or repercussive medicine,” which is
        used to “force backe the humour which flowes from any other place into
        the part” and to “mitigate the heat of such inflammation as that
        defluxion of humors hath caused, yea oft times to asswage and helpe
        paine.”<a href="#fn13"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref13"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> Paré describes the composition
        of these “repercussives” as mixtures and vinegar solutions of a mélange
        of plants, oils, herbs and minerals.<a href="#fn14"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref14"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> The medium by which they are
        applied—linen cloth, bandages and compresses—is also, according to Paré,
        “repellant.”<a href="#fn15"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref15"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> Storax is a medicinal simple
        used in “resolving medicine,” which dissipates the build-up of morbid
        matter by way of its intense heat and moisture. And so, according to
        Paré, the resin acts as the “humectifying” agent in this curative
        analgesic. The properties of storax will be further addressed later in
        the essay. First, it is important to identify what the
        author-practitioner is referring to when he calls for “golden and yellow
        marcasite.”</p>
    <p>The author-practitioner’s use of marcasite in his gout recipe complicates
        this picture because it is difficult to be certain which mineral he is
        referring to; marcasite and pyrite are often conflated as they are both
        made up of iron disulfide, although they are two different minerals with
        distinct crystal formations.<a href="#fn16"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref16"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> Cotgrave defines “gold and
        yellow marcasite” as being a “fire-stone; a mineral that smells like
        brimstone; and is of two kinds; the yellow, shining as gold; and the
        white (the purer, and better of the two) like silver.”<a href="#fn17"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref17"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> Cotgrave’s shining
        particles—mimicking gold—relate to the author-practitioner’s description
        of marcasite; his reference to the smell of brimstone relates to its
        mineral composition. Further ambiguities are reflected in the sources.
        For example, though Paré describes marcasite as cold and dry,<a
           href="#fn18"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref18"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> Guy de Chauliac views the
        mineral as being hot in the second degree and dry in the third.<a

           id="fnref19"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a> (Could it be that Chauliac
        associates the mineral with heat because of its sulphuric qualities?)
        And so, it is not possible to know quite what medical properties the
        author-practitioner attributes to the marcasite. Is it cold and
        “repellant”? Or hot and “resolving”? An examination of the recipe’s
        other two ingredients—storax and urine—suggests some tentative answers
        to these questions.</p>
    <p>Cotgrave describes storax as a “sweet Gumme” and differentiates between
        two types: <em>storax calamite</em> (“the best kind of storax brought
        from Aleppo, and kept in canes of the leaves of reedes”) and <em>storax
            liquide</em> (“liquid storax”), a gum he defines as being synonymous
        with <em>Myrrhe stacte</em>, which he describes as “the best kind of
        Myrrhe … [it] is indeed the iuyce, or gummie liquor of the fattest
        Myrre.”<a href="#fn20"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref20"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> Both storax descriptions remark
        on the high quality of the gum but fail to provide a physical
        description, save for the implication that <em>storax liquide</em>,
        given its name, is an essential oil. A similar distinction is made in a
        1555 Spanish translation of Dioscorides’s <em>De materia medica</em> by
        the physician Andrés de Laguna. Here, storax is defined as:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>liquor de un arbol que se parece al membrillo; y aquel se tiene por
            mas excellente, que es roxo, grasso, resinoso, blanquezino en sus
            granos, qye preservera muy lungo tiempo oloroso y quando se ablanda,
            da de si un humor semejante al miel. [a liquor from a tree that is
            similar to quince; the most excellent one is red, thick, resinous,

    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>Dioscorides makes mention of both the
        liquor and the resin: a red-white, odiferous substance. It is this solid
        form of storax that Paré mentions in his list of <em>diaphoreticke</em>
        simples, substances that by intense heat dissolve impacted morbid
        matter. His list includes <em>styrax</em>, <em>calamita</em> and
        <em>benioinium</em>, which are all solids.<a href="#fn22"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref22"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a> If the storax/styrax is meant to
        impart intense heat in order to dissolve the impaction of humoral
        matter, then it is possible that the marcasite is, in fact, there to
        further block the buildup of said humors, creating a sort of early
        modern icy-hot compress. However, would this recipe—which calls for four
        pounds of urine—produce enough distillate to soak a cloth that is then
        to be applied to an afflicted body part? My reconstruction will address
        this question, as well as the feasibility of the distillation recipe
        itself.</p>
    <h2 id="reconstruction">Reconstruction</h2>
    <p>For the purposes of our reconstruction, I chose to use iron disulfide,
        commonly referred to as pyrite.<a href="#fn23"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref23"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a> It both matches Cotgrave’s
        description of its gold and yellow color and it contains a high
        percentage of sulfur, giving it a sulphuric smell. Following
        Dioscorides’s description and Paré’s listing of the resin as a
        <em>diaphoreticke</em>, I decided it would be best to use the tree resin
        rather than the liquor, or essential oil. For this reconstruction, the
        Making and Knowing laboratory purchased <em>Styrax benzoin</em> resin.
        The first step of the reconstruction was to powder the pieces of pyrite
        and storax. In questioning the feasibility of this recipe, my first
        concern was whether I would be able to easily powder the pyrite with a
        mortar and pestle. Current gemmological standards rank pyrite between 6
        to 6.5 on the Mohs hardness scale, meaning that this mineral can be
        scratched by an iron file.<a href="#fn24"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref24"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a> But, does its scratchability
        mean that it is also easily powdered?</p>
    <p>For the powdering portion of the reconstruction, I began with the harder
        of the two substances—the pyrite. The author-practitioner does not give
        instructions on how to do this, which suggests that it was such common
        practice that it did not merit further elaboration. Powdering and
        grinding were an integral part of distilling; the title plate engraving
        of Jan van der Straet’s <em>Nova Reperta</em> series, depicting the
        discoveries—or inventions—of the New World, includes a mortar and pestle
        in its illustration of distillation paraphernalia (<i><u>Fig. 1</u></i>). It is possible then that the phrase “powdered marcasite” in the
        distillation entry provides enough detail for a practitioner well-versed
        in medical distillations.</p>

    <p>Powdering the pyrite did not take long and proved to be quite easy. After
        pounding the pyrite for thirty seconds, the pebble-sized pieces broke
        down into smaller, granular ones. I ground it down further with the
        pestle until it was a combination of powdered and granular bits. Next, I
        chose to powder the storax. Though the author-practitioner does not does
        specify in what state the storax should be used, his later instruction
        to “incorporate [all the ingredients] well together, little by little,”
        suggested that the storax should also be powdered. Being a much softer
        substance than the pyrite, the storax crushed into a finer powder. It
        was sticky and oily, and smelled strongly of vanilla and cinnamon.
        Overall, I deduced that anyone with a mortar and pestle would be able to
        successfully grind down pieces of pyrite and storax to a fine powder (<i><u>Fig. 2</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 3</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 4</u></i>).

    <p>The last main step was to carry out the distillation itself. For this, I
        measured out the urine, pyrite and storax, and I set up my “alembic” (<i><u>Fig. 5</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 6</u></i>). Following the
        author-practitioner’s instructions, I slowly incorporated the storax and
        then the pyrite into the urine. As neither is water soluble, they did
        not dissolve. The mixture did, however, become cloudy with the storax
        particles, while the pyrite turned everything gray (<i><u>Fig. 7</u></i>). There is no mention in the entry of what this mixture should look
        like. A main concern of the author-practitioner is that the ingredients
        be well incorporated, and so I took this change of color to be a sign of
        the ingredients blending together. The author-practitioner then
        instructs the reader first to boil all the ingredients together and,
        second, to “distill the imbibed urine, separated by inclination.”<a

                Though neither the pyrite nor the storax dissolved into the
                urine, they did turn it cloudy and grey, respectively. I took
                this is a sign that the ingredients had been well incorporated,

    <p>First, the urine mixture was placed inside a pot. A pyrex bowl was set
        inside as well, in order to catch the distillate. The pot’s lid, which I
        covered in a sheet of copper to mimic the copper-headed alembic referred
        to by the author-practitioner, was placed on top, upside down (<i><u>Fig. 8</u></i>). When the mixture began to boil, we filled the
        copper-covered lid with ice and allowed it to continue boil until almost
        all the liquid had evaporated (<i><u>Fig. 9</u></i>). The result was a
        yellow-hued distillate that smelled of all three of its ingredients:
        urine, pyrite and storax (<i><u>Fig. 10</u></i>). The distillation
        yielded just under 20 ml and had gone from a ph of 6, before the
        distillation, to a ph of 7 to 8 after, which means that it was slightly
        more alkaline than before and almost close to the ph of water. My
        reconstruction managed to produce a substantial amount of distillate
        considering that I used a fraction of the amount of urine called for in
        the entry on fol. 7v. This led me to conclude that if this distillation
        were to be done with the recommended four pounds of urine it would
        certainly produce enough distillate to soak a cloth and apply it to the
        gouty area.</p>

                an alembic “covered with a copper head.” Our answer to this was
                to place the piece of copper sheeting around the pot lid. This
                created a space between the sheeting and the top, into which we

    <h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
    <p>Overall, the reconstruction proved that this recipe would have been
        accessible to a practitioner with the proper distillation equipment. It
        was not difficult to put together, and it produced enough distillate to
        be usable as a topical remedy. An examination of the contemporary
        understanding of the recipe’s ingredients, especially the marcasite and
        storax, elucidates the fact that this remedy was thought to break up and
        dissolve an accumulation of morbid matter. Such an illness is what
        Michael Stolberg identifies as a “flux,” a general medical term under
        which gout falls. Given these considerations, this recipe “to relieve
        the pain of G.” is most likely for gout, which we can define as a
        painful ailment derived from a flow of morbid matter, including but not
        limited to pain in the joints.</p>

                    By contrast, syphilis, called “Mal de Naples” by Cotgrave,
                    is defined as “The French Pocks; or, the Neoplitane disease,
                    first gotten by the French (of the Spaniards) at the siege
                    of Naples, Anno Dom. 1528.” His explanation of syphilis is
                    historical rather than symptomatic or medical. Here, he
                    gives a version of the common origin story of syphilis,
                    which was believed to have been spread by the Spaniards or
                    Taino captives returning from Hispaniola with Columbus and
                    later infecting Italian and French soldiers alike in the
                    Siege of Naples in 1528. Syphilis and gonorrhea were often
                    conflated until the nineteenth century, when they were
                    disambiguated by French physician Philippe Ricord. See

                    <em>Pirotechnia</em>, Biringuccio also describes the mineral
                    as having a strong sulfuric odor. He writes, “his
                    composition called marcasite is found in various kinds and
                    colors. That which is clear and yellow would surely seem to
                    be very fine gold if it were heavier. It is also found,
                    albeit in small quantities, of such a whiteness that it
                    seems to be pieces of well-cupeled and burnished silver…
                    Whatever their form may be, they have a strong smell of
                    sulphur when they are handled, and they are not extremely
                    hard. One kind is found that is very easily crumbled.”
