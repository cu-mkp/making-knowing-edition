        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <div>
            <p>Ms. Fr. 640 contains several recipes detailing techniques to
                imitate the optical properties of gold using less precious
                materials. Of these, two recipes (fols. <a
                   href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/29v/f/29v/tl"><u>29v</u></a>
                and <a
                   href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/57r/f/57r/tl"><u>57r</u></a>)
                detail the making of a “color of gold without gold on silver” by
                applying a golden colored varnish over silver leaf. The varnish
                derives its tint from <em>terra merita</em>, which the
                author-practitioner identifies as “turmeric root” (<em>racine de
                    cucurme</em>) on fol. <a
                   href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/148r/f/148r/tl"><u>148r</u></a>.
                Yet much remains mysterious about <em>terra merita</em>, its
                preparation, and its use in the history of craft practice. This
                essay reconstructs the turmeric-based “gold without gold on
                silver,” and it investigates the occurrence of <em>terra
                    merita</em> in artisanal texts and the use of yellow
                varnishes to color metals.</p>

    <p>Creating “gold without gold” has been a concern of alchemists, artisans,
        and artists for centuries. In fact, it is one of the primary concerns of
        <em>Physika kai Mystika,</em> a recipe book for dyeing and coloring
        thought to date back to the first century CE and often considered one of
        the earliest alchemical writings.<a href="#fn1"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref1"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> It is thus unsurprising that the
        author-practitioner of BnF Ms. Fr. 640 includes not one but at least ten
        recipes that involve creating a golden color without the use of
        elemental gold.<a href="#fn2"

        “Color of gold without gold on silver” and an untitled section within a
        larger entry called “Painter” respectively, are recipes for applying a
        gold color to silver leaf. One aspect sets them apart from other similar
        recipes found in other manuscripts and later texts: the instructions to
        use <em>terre emerita</em> or <em>terra emerita</em>.<a href="#fn3"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref3"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
    <p>Though a quick internet search reveals that <em>terra merita</em> is
        another name for <em>curcuma longa</em>, commonly known in English as
        “turmeric,” the actual identity and nature of <em>terra merita</em> is
        still, perhaps, the biggest mystery of these two recipes.<a href="#fn4"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref4"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> First, reconstruction quickly
        showed that the average turmeric found in a pantry today could not be
        used as a pigment. Moreover, references in historical sources about the
        use of turmeric as a pigment are few and far between prior to the
        eighteenth century. Finally, the intended use of the
        author-practitioner’s “gold without gold” remains an open question. This
        essay explores both the use of turmeric and the subject of gold-colored
        varnish.</p>
    <h2 id="materials-and-techniques">Materials and Techniques</h2>
    <p>Though similar in aim and ingredients, the two recipes differ slightly.
        On fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/29v/f/29v/tl"><u>29v</u></a>,
        in order to obtain a color more beautiful than fine gold, the
        author-practitioner instructs us to color silver leaf with some
        <em>terre emerita</em> and, once it is dry, to apply a coat of “spike
        lavender oil varnish and of sandarac.” The recipe is short and gives few
        indications of quantities or surface to be covered. It assumes the
        existence of a silver-gilded surface on which the <em>terra merita</em>
        is to be applied. The spike lavender oil varnish called for may be the
        one detailed on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/4r/f/4r/tl"><u>4r</u></a>.
        The first mystery comes in the form of the <em>terra merita</em>, which
        must be dry before applying the varnish, implying that it was previously
        wet. It had thus been mixed with something else in order to make it
        liquid.</p>
    <p>On fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/57r/f/57r/tl"><u>57r</u></a>,
        in a continuation of an entry entitled “Painter,” begun on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/56v/f/56v/tl"><u>56v</u></a>,
        the author-practitioner instructs to take <em>terra emerita</em>—this
        time powdered—and boil it together with varnish, either of spike
        lavender oil or turpentine. As we shall see, this slight modification
        has a significant impact on the final result of the reconstruction of
        these recipes for gold without gold. Another interesting aspect of this
        recipe is its preoccupation with how long the varnish takes to dry: “a
        quarter of an hour, in winter as well as summer,” so long as no aloe is
        added. Apart from its use of <em>terra merita</em>, this recipe closely
        resembles recipes found in other manuscripts, notably the
        <em>auripetrum</em> recipe of Petrus de S. Audemar.<a href="#fn5"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref5"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
    <h2 id="reconstruction">Reconstruction</h2>
    <p>The first step in reconstructing these recipes was to create the gilded
        silver leaf surface on which the <em>terra merita</em> and varnishes
        would be applied. Gilding is a very delicate task, and would have
        required years of training. In Tournai, during the Renaissance,
        goldsmith guild regulations required apprentices to train in gilding for
        two extra years on top of the basic two-year training period because of
        the delicate and costly nature of the task.<a href="#fn6"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref6"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> It is unsurprising, then, that my
        attempts at gilding after an afternoon of training were time consuming
        and far from perfect, despite the smooth surface provided by my gesso
        panel and burnished bole (<i><u>Fig. 1</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 2</u></i>).<a
           href="#fn7"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref7"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> Once the gilded silver was
        burnished, the groundwork had been laid for the testing of the recipes.

    <p>In experimenting with the turmeric for the recipe on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/29r/f/29r/tl"><u>29r</u></a>,
        it quickly became apparent that the turmeric could not be used as a
        pigment in its store-bought powdered form. Attempts to mix it with water
        or oil to form a paint revealed that some fibers could not be ground
        down to create a smooth paint (<i><u>Fig. 3</u></i>), and a continued
        examination of the traces applied to the gesso showed that the color
        obtained was not fast on exposure to light and faded quickly (<i><u>Fig. 4</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 5</u></i>). A pigment would have to be
        extracted from the turmeric in order to create a more stable and
        particle-free color.</p>

    <p>According to modern sources, the best option for extracting the pigment
        is a solvent extraction using ethyl acetate.<a href="#fn8"

        used grain alcohol with a 95% alcohol (ethanol) content as a solvent.
        The pigment obtained from this extraction was not a powder but a thick
        paste. Because it was supposed to dissolve in oil, I attempted to make a
        paint with linseed oil, using a muller to grind the two together. This
        created a rich orange paint (<i><u>Fig. 6</u></i>).<a href="#fn10"

        turpentine was the most gold-like in color, as the initial color of the
        gold-colored spike lavender oil varnish was too bright to pass as gold.
        After two weeks, the color of the squares using the spike lavender oil
        varnish had faded significantly, while those with the turpentine varnish
        held their color much better (<i><u>Fig. 11</u></i>).</p>

    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>The square with the golden spike lavender
        oil varnish had faded to a color very close to genuine gold leaf, but
        the rapidity with which it faded puts into question the durability of
        the color (<i><u>Vid. 3</u></i>). Significantly, the author-practitioner
        warns on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/4r/f/4r/tl"><u>4r</u></a>
        against using spike lavender oil varnish with color because it will “eat
        away at the color” (<em>mange les couleurs</em>). The results show that
        this was indeed the case, which raises questions about why he would
        suggest the use of spike lavender oil varnish later on in the
        manuscript. Since the note on fol. 4r describing the effects of spike
        lavender oil on color is written in a slightly sketchier and hasiter
        hand, it is likely that this note was added at a later date, after the
        author-practitioner had attempted to use the varnish and noticed its
        effects. This provides further evidence that the author-practitioner was
        more than simply a collector of recipes—he was trying these recipes
        himself.</p>

    <p>Moreover, though the result of my reconstruction was successful in
        producing a gold-like effect, it is still distinguishable from real
        gold. In <em>The Materials and Techniques of Medieval Painting</em>,
        Daniel V. Thompson, on the subject of substitutes for gold in the Middle
        Ages, suggests that “medieval eyes were very easily deceived, for most
        of these substitutes are very weakly like real gold. If they were yellow
        and shiny, and particularly if they had any sort of metallic sparkle,
        they were acceptable.”<a href="#fn14"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref14"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> This raises questions about the
        author-practitioner’s intention: was his primary concern to produce the
        <em>color</em> of gold, or to reproduce as faithfully as possible other
        properties of gold, such as its luster and shine?</p>
    <p>Finally, I was left with questions about the varnish. It had been very
        viscous and nearly impossible to spread, it did not dry in one quarter
        of an hour, and an impression was still left on the varnish when touched
        with the tip of the finger after a half hour. Was my process in making
        the varnish faulty? Is this related to my interpretation of <em>terra
            merita</em> and the turmeric extract I used? This brings me to a
        last series of questions: how did the author-practitioner work with his
        <em>terra merita</em>, especially for its use in the recipe on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/29v/f/29v/tl"><u>29v</u></a>?
        It seems, based on my experiment, that it would be nearly impossible to
        create a smooth and bright varnish without performing some kind of
        extraction on turmeric. If that is the case, and, since there are no
        indications to do so in the recipe, it might be assumed that such an
        extraction was a fairly well-known process. How extensively, then, was
        turmeric used in Europe at the time? And how common was “gold without
        gold”?</p>
    <h2 id="historical-context">Historical context</h2>
    <h3 id="gold-without-gold">Gold Without Gold</h3>
    <p>Techniques for reproducing the color and effects of gold have been known
        for centuries and appear in the written record in various forms. One
        technique, described by Cennino Cennini in <em>Il libro dell’arte</em>
        around the turn of the fifteenth century and common in all of Europe by
        the Late Middle Ages, was the use of mosaic gold, also known as
        <em>aurum musivum</em>.<a href="#fn15"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref15"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> This was used to illuminate
        manuscripts, to paint, and to write on both parchment and panels, and it
        was made with a mix of sal ammoniac, tin, sulfur, and quicksilver.<a
           href="#fn16"

           id="fnref16"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
    <p>If, however, we concentrate on the techniques in Ms. Fr. 640, namely, the
        application of a gold-colored varnish over silver leaf, there are
        several versions predating by far those found in Ms. Fr. 640. Assumed to
        be written in the second half of the first century CE by its most recent
        translator Matteo Martelli, the second half of pseudo-Democritus’s
        <em>On the Making of Purple and Gold</em> contains multiple instructions
        for the use of liquid washes or paints for coloring metals. Similar
        recipes can be found in the Leiden and Stockholm papyri (early fourth
        century CE).<a href="#fn17"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref17"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> One such recipe tells us to
        “take Cilician saffron,” which Pliny says is the “most esteemed” kind,<a
           href="#fn18"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref18"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> “dissolve the saffron flowers
        with the above prescribed grape juice [Aminean wine]; make a wash as is

           href="#fn19"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref19"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a> Pseudo-Democritus ends his

        nature through successful imitation one that our author-practitioner
        also experienced?</p>
    <p>In his twelfth-century treatise <em>On Diverse Arts,</em> Theophilus uses
        a similar technique on tin. Like pseudo-Democritus he does not apply his
        coloring matter onto the metal but calls for the immersion of the metal
        leaf into a hot mixture of wine- or beer-colored gold with alder
        buckthorn and saffron. Varnish is then applied over the tin sheet and
        left to dry. Once dry, Theophilus tells us that “you have leaves of tin
        which you may lay on your works as you wish with hide glue.”<a
           href="#fn21"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref21"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a> This two-phase process of
        separating the coloring from the varnishing phase has parallels with the
        first recipe for “gold without gold” found on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/29v/f/29v/tl"><u>29v</u></a>
        of Ms. Fr. 640, although the wording of the recipe seems to indicate
        that the silver leaf has already been applied to a ground prior to the
        application of the <em>terra merita</em> for coloring.</p>
    <p>Cennino Cennini provides a set of instructions for coloring metal to
        imitate gold. He, like Theophilus, also uses tin and gives some insights
        into how and why this technique might be used. Cennini tells us that
        “gold tinted tin is made in the following way: Take up a completely
        smooth board three or four braccia long and have it greased with fat or
        with tallow. You put some of the plain tin on it, then you overlay the
        tin with a solution called gold size.”<a href="#fn22"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref22"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a> Though Cennini does not provide
        a recipe for this gold size and seems to confuse his instructions for
        gilding on tin with those on the making of gold-tinted tin, it can be
        assumed that this gold size is used in a fashion similar to our
        author-practitioner’s varnish. Though he describes the process of making
        gold-tinted tin, Cennini discourages its use stating that “most people
        habitually decorate walls with gold-tinted tin because it is less
        expensive, but I urge you to take this advice: force yourself always to
        do your decorations with gold leaf and with good pigments, especially on
        the figure of Our Lady.” His justification is that, while more costly,
        the use of gold leaf will help the artist to acquire a better reputation
        that might eventually lead to commissions.<a href="#fn23"

    <p>In her collection of medieval and Renaissance treatises, Mary P.
        Merrifield provides a description of a gold-colored varnish that the
        manuscripts she transcribes call <em>auripetrum</em>. Both Petrus S.
        Audemar and Eraclius list recipes for it. In these recipes, Spanish
        saffron and aloes are used to give the varnish its gold hue.<a
           href="#fn24"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref24"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a> Merrifield, perhaps influenced
        by Cennini’s reference to the price of gold leaf, states that
        <em>auripetrum</em> was used when patrons were unwilling to pay for gold
        because the price of gold was “beyond the reach of all but the rich.”<a

        the expenses of paintings executed in the chapel of S. Jacopo di

    <p>Although the source Merrifield provides for this information has proven
        difficult to find, I have identified at least two examples of the use of
        this process on objects that predate Ms. Fr. 640. One example of this
        technique is a thirteenth-century panel painting of S. Francesco
        d’Assisi, where testing has shown that the now blackened tin background
        was once covered with a golden varnish.<a href="#fn27"

    <p>While my research has sought parallels for the application of golden
        varnish onto a silver substrate, an intriguing document from early
        seventeenth-century Paris shows that less precious metals were being

        important piece of context for the author-practitioner’s “gold without
        gold” recipes. The document, dated December 29, 1617, registers a
        commercial partnership between two peddlers who, between them, had
        various pieces of latten colored with a [cold] enamel of <em>terra
            merita</em> (<em>en couleur de terramerita esmaillee</em>). These
        small works of imitation gold functioned as bridal adornments for young
        women living in the countryside (<em>servant a atours d’espousees pour
            filles de villaige</em>). This suggests that the two peddlers were
        supplying the businesses of <em>atourneresses</em>, that is, women who
        rented bridal clothing and jewelry in early modern France.<a

            Leather</em>, leather hangings were at the height of their
        popularity in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries and could be found
        in most of Europe. Despite their popularity, few of these survive today
        in their original state both because the leatherwork itself has been

    <p>A 1766 book based on the writings of Roger de Piles, who was active in

        Georges-Louis Leclerc Buffon also refers to this technique in the

        garnishings on furniture, among other things. In his opinion, this
        “gives an air of opulence to the poorest of materials” yet is quite
        easily distinguished from real gold.<a href="#fn38"

        been used on furniture in southern Italy, especially in Naples and
        Sicily, where it was called <em>doratura a mecca</em> in the seventeenth

        varnish was in fact so widespread that the 1741 <em>Dictionnaire

    <blockquote>
        <p>the ease in deceiving the public with this false gold leaf has
            prompted the Regulation of 1721 by which it is forbidden, under
            threat of confiscation and a one hundred pound fine, to all painters
            and gilders, to make any work in varnished silver, unless they
            declare it with the bureau de la Communauté, have had an plaque
            brought by the Juries with this inscription, “Varnished silver
            without gold,” and for greater security, have put someplace visible

    <p>The above research demonstrates that the use of gold-colored varnish was
        a common practice, especially in the making of gilt leather and Italian
        furniture, however, in the accounts of this practice, <em>terra
            merita</em> is rarely mentioned. How common an ingredient was it at
        the time? In order to answer this question, I now turn to an
        investigation of the main ingredient of the two recipes in Ms. Fr. 640:
        the <em>terra merita</em>.</p>

    <p>Searching for the use of <em>terra merita</em> or turmeric as a pigment
        in modern publications at first yielded few results. In their book on
        the trade in artists’ materials, Jo Kirby and her co-authors include
        only a short note stating that it was “found in India and other parts of

    <p>The publications contemporary with Ms. Fr. 640—which we estimate to be

        earlier sources such as Dioscorides’s <em>De materia medica</em>,
        written in the first century CE<em>.</em> Dioscorides never saw the
        plant in question, and he did not use any of its common names, but he
        does describe the ginger-like root with the color of saffron fairly
        accurately, even mentioning its depilatory characteristics, something

    <p>Despite the herbal authors’ statement that curcuma was commonly used by
        painters, contemporary confirmation from practitioners beyond the
        author-practitioner of Ms. Fr. 640 has proved elusive. Even the 1617
        Parisian document, discussed above, which notes a cold enamel (i.e.,
        paint) of <em>terra merita</em> applied to latten jewelry in imitation
        of gold, tells us relatively little about the processes of its making
        beyond what we can extrapolate from the phrase <em>terramerita
            esmaillee</em>. The most relevant reference is in Benvenuto
        Cellini’s <em>Treatises on Goldsmithing and Sculpture</em>, where
        Cellini calls for the use of “cuccuma,” which we can suppose to be a
        misspelling of the word curcuma, in a “Recipe for Making Colours and
        Colouring the Gilded Parts.” His process is quite different from the
        author-practitioner’s varnishing of silver leaf, instead requiring the
        material to be dyed to be dipped into the heated mixture that includes
        the turmeric. He also notes that this coloring matter is weak.<a

        blond,<a href="#fn58"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref58"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>58</sup></a> but also as far away as Japan,
        where it was used to dye cloth. It was also commonly used in India.<a
           href="#fn59"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref59"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>59</sup></a> Despite the existence of
        contemporary references to its use as a dye, the eighteenth-century
        <em>Encyclopédie méthodique</em>: <em>Arts et métiers mécaniques</em>
        lists the painting of hardwood floors as its only use.<a href="#fn60"

    <p>It is not until the mid-eighteenth century, in <em>Secrets concernans les
            arts et métiers,</em> that I found the first mention outside of Ms.
        Fr. 640 and Cellini’s treatise of <em>terra merita</em> being used as an
        ingredient for giving a gold color to metal, in this case to tin or
        steel. It is not, however, the main ingredient, giving precedence to
        orpiment.<a href="#fn61"

           id="fnref61"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>61</sup></a> As noted above, Tingry also
        describes the use of <em>terra merita</em> in varnish in the early
        nineteenth century.</p>
    <p>One hypothesis to explain the lack of early references to the use of
        turmeric might lie in the fact that one of its common names in
        sixteenth-century herbals was <em>safran d’Inde</em> or <em>safran
            d’Indie</em>, which could indicate that it was listed as saffron in
        recipe books, or simply substituted for it, though I have found no
        source that would prove this confusion of the two.<a href="#fn62"

    <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Clearly, much about the use of turmeric remains to be researched, not the
        least of which was its place in the spice trade and the routes by which
        turmeric was brought into Europe. Its appearance in Ms. Fr. 640 and
        other early modern texts, however, shows that <em>terra merita</em>,
        which this essay has understood to be turmeric in some form, was known
        earlier and used more extensively than some modern scholars believe.</p>
    <p>Quoting Maxine Berg, Ulinka Rublack suggests that “the material world can
        only properly be understood through an engagement with ‘actual
        products’: ‘how they were designed and made’ and ‘what they were used
        for.’”<a href="#fn63"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref63"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>63</sup></a> But how can we investigate these
        questions when the object of our study is of an ephemeral nature?
        Examples of the technique of using silver to imitate gold, though few in
        number, exist to this day in museum collections, but as we do not know
        in many of these cases what pigment was used to create the golden color,
        can we be sure that the author-practitioner’s recipe produced the same
        results? The reconstruction of the recipes for “gold without gold”
        allowed the reproduction of one of these “actual products,” which
        provided a useful starting point for historical research on both the
        technique and the ingredients. Although our author-practitioner does not
        indicate how this “gold without gold” was to be used, seeing the results
        of the reconstruction and comparing it to similar techniques used
        throughout history in Europe, we can begin to imagine how the technique
        might have been applied.</p>
