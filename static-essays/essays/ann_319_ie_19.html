<h2 id="introduction"><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
<p>BnF Ms. Fr. 640 comprises a miscellanea of recipes and instructions
ranging from artisanal to household and medical, providing a
comprehensive representation of arts and crafts techniques. While much
research on such texts often focuses solely on understanding techniques
and practices, it is crucial to emphasize that these recipes and
instructions were written within specific contexts and for particular
purposes. As Pamela Smith notes, craftspeople were “not illiterate, but
were fluent, rather, in a different kind of language and
knowledge.”<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;Indeed, treatises such as Ms. Fr. 640 challenge
researchers to evaluate this different kind of language and the
environment in and for which it was used. In this essay, I delve into
the broader context of what might be seen simply as applied or practical
knowledge, examining how Ms. Fr. 640, described by the Making and
Knowing Project as a “set of working notes”, might have been compiled
and used.<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The circumstances of labor, the materials and techniques used in
artisanal workshops, and the orientation and choreography of tasks
between master, assistants, and apprentices, are all framed by place and
time. As we shall see, there were, especially among artisans, fewer
trade or “disciplinary” silos and more cross disciplinary
collaborations, often instigated by market demand and patronage. In the
late sixteenth century, during the period Ms. Fr. 640 was produced,
societal demands regarding taste, politics, and economics stimulated the
establishment of what could best be described as a statecraft system.
Groupings of artisanal workshops were established at courts that aimed
at economic growth and brand building, fueled by knowledge exchange
between the artisans and, of course, by robust competition in skills and
technical innovation. Understanding these multifaceted contexts, from
workshops to courts and states, in which artifacts were produced for the
court’s galleries and palaces as well as for political exchange of
gifts, sheds light on the motivation of the author-practitioner of Bnf
Ms. Fr. 640 in writing and compiling his text.</p>
<p>In this essay, I explore how the content of Ms. Fr. 640 can be
related to late sixteenth- and early seventeenth-century workshop
constellations, whether set within an urban context, and/or situated at
courts that formed the administrative centers of regions, cities, and
states. To develop this, I examine court workshops in Florence and
Pesaro as case studies, contextualizing their practical rationale and
their high appraisal of technical innovation and skill. I also examine
the close proximity of different types of artistry within the workshops
and evaluate its effect on technical knowledge production. Finally, I
make initial observations on the political, economic, and artistic
rationale behind these workshop conglomerates, or, as we might call them
today, “creative industries.”</p>
<h2 id="court-workshops-sixteenth-century-creative-industries"><strong>Court
Workshops: Sixteenth-Century Creative Industries</strong></h2>
<p>In the late sixteenth and early seventeenth century, various European
courts, from modest small city states to grand courts such as that of
the Medici in Florence, established artisanal workshop clusters,
sometimes set in motion by an official court decree. These workshops
were managed by the court administration and comprised a wide range of
professions producing objects ranging from the temporary and ephemeral
to the durable and valuable, from modest household items to serve the
court to armory and fountain designs, to highly sophisticated artifacts
that demonstrated skilled craftsmanship, technical innovation, and
material preciousness.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>The rationale for these court workshop conglomerates with their
highly skilled artisans and artists may have arisen out of a concern
with practical, useful, “statecraft” knowledge, as Samuel Quiccheberg
(Antwerp 1529–Munich 1567), a physician and librarian at Albrecht V’s
court in Munich described in detail in his treatise
<em>Inscriptiones</em> (1565). In this work, he presents the “practical,
empirical, and artisanal knowledge” incorporated in objects in the
so-called <em>Kunstkammer</em> collections.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>To explore a plausible context for Ms. Fr. 640 within this concept of
statecraft, I first turn to the establishment at the Medici court in
Florence of the so-called <em>Galleria dei Lavori</em>, a series of
workshops situated on the ground floor of what is now the Uffizi
Gallery. Additional information is gleaned from a similar gathering of
<em>Botteghini</em> in the Ducal Palace at the court of Duke Francesco
Maria II della Rovere in the Duchy of Pesaro and Urbino. Finally, I
briefly examine some aspects of the Louvre <em>logements</em> in
Paris.</p>
<h2 id="the-florentine-galleria-dei-lavori-and-the-pesaro-botteghini"><strong>The
Florentine <em>Galleria dei Lavori</em> and the Pesaro
<em>botteghini</em></strong></h2>
<p>The Florence and Pesaro courts were related through both military and
family connections. Ferdinando I de’ Medici announced the establishment
of the <em>Galleria dei Lavori</em> by official decree in 1588, while
the Pesaro workshops precede them, being recorded in court documents
from 1581 onwards albeit in a less formalized way. It is plausible that
they were both inspired by the workshops in the Casino San Marco in
Florence, the predecessor of the <em>Galleria dei Lavori</em>, which
housed alchemical laboratories and the Medici porcelain and ceramics
workshops, glass making, gem carving and rock crystal fusing, to name
but a few of what some historians have seen as the artisanal activities
related to alchemy taking place there.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>
Ferdinando I de’ Medici’s predecessor Francesco I, saw the Casino San
Marco as a “place for scientific experiment.”<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> He
relocated most of the San Marco workshops to the Uffizi
<em>Galleria</em> in 1587–88, leaving the alchemical laboratories at the
Casino San Marco.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>The ample archival evidence on the Pesaro and Florentine
establishments provides fascinating insights into their purpose,
organization, administration, and the artists and artisans employed. The
archives of both courts include numerous ledgers, chronicling payments
to the courts’ craftsmen and artists. These records meticulously
describe the expenses for materials and labor associated with each
specific commission, accompanied by detailed notes on the maker(s)
involved, and sometimes include the names of those for whom the objects
were made. Furthermore, the records list the costs of the materials and
the time invested in the making process. Sometimes they even contain
critical notes on the quality of the work in progress, and robust
comments on the laziness of the artisans involved were regularly
added.</p>
<p>These documents depict a lively and very active artistic environment
with ample cross-disciplinary dissemination and collaborations for the
manufacture of a broad range of products, both to furnish the court
itself as well as for gifts.</p>
<h3 id="pesaro">Pesaro</h3>
<p>In 1581, in Pesaro, Francesco Maria II della Rovere (1549–1631) added
a range of <em>botteghini,</em> or workshops to the ducal palace as part
of a new wing which also included a gallery and library. There were
twenty-three workshop spaces opening onto the street, with living
quarters on the floor above, a structure still intact today and now
occupied by a range of shops, from fashion and ceramics to jewelry.</p>
<p>Contemporary chronicler Antonio Zacconi provides “A note on the
craftsmen that were kept by the Most Serene Francesco Maria the Second,
Duke of Urbino, in the workshops in his own palace in Pesaro, hired and
salaried by him.” Zacconi lists “Two painters,&nbsp;that is Terenzio Terenzi
da Pesaro, who works in human figures, Giovanni Sceppere from Flanders,
who works in landscapes. Valerio Mariani da Pesaro, a singular and rare
miniaturist, who in a similar profession has few equals that can be
compared with him or surpass him. Simonzio Lupi da Bergamo, he, too, a
singular and excellent miniaturist. Boniforte Griciotti, jeweller from
Milano. Nicolò Todesco, goldsmith, Nicolo Mogiasco, silversmith, Jacopo
Cossa from Piemonte, inlayer in ebony, Vespasiano Griffi from Pesaro,
clockmaker, Aloisio Paccotti da Boncifreddo, also clockmaker, Bartolomeo
Tedesco, bookbinder.”<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>Other documents from the Pesaro court add yet more professions such
as sculptors, scientific instrument makers, embroiderers, potters, gun
makers and fountain builders. The duke paid this wide range of artists
and artisans a monthly wage, plus a supply of candles, firewood, and,
especially important, a fixed volume of wine. Materials for each
commission were paid separately and the artisans were allowed to also
sell directly to the public once their obligations to the court were
fulfilled. Their production was meant to furnish the new gallery with
precious objects, but also provide political and diplomatic gifts.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> The correspondence of the duke with
his ambassadors across Italy and abroad shows an active search for the
best artists and artisans, who would be selected on the basis of their
superior skills.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="florence">Florence</h3>
<p>A similar grouping of workshops was established in 1588 by Ferdinando
I de’ Medici (1587–1609), by official decree. Artists and craftsmen from
Florence, from the Casino San Marco and workshops across the city, as
well as from abroad were hired by the court and provided with a workshop
on the ground floor of what is now the Uffizi Gallery.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a>
Again, there is a wide range of professions represented: “jewelers, all
the stone cutters of every type, cosmographers, goldsmiths,
miniaturists, guardians of the <em>Galleria</em>, wood turners,
confectioners, distillers, artisans of porcelain, sculptors, and
painters, and workers of a crystal-kiln, including also Michele della
Zecca [of the mint], Marcello master of the arquebus, and Colonnese the
writer….”<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a>&nbsp; There are also <em>botteghe</em>
housing a smith, a certain maestro Gulielmo Francese with his German
assistant, two stone-cutters, two German cabinet makers with their two
German assistants, frame makers, two rock crystal workers, a clockmaker,
three goldsmiths, a gem and stone worker, stone and gem polishers, two
stone sawyers, a weapon maker, a miniaturist, two painters, an
architect, alchemists and glass blowers, furbishers, harquebus makers,
firework makers, fountain builders.” The list also mentions the
<em>bottega</em> of goldsmith Jaques Bylivelt (Delft 1550–Florence
1603), a highly skilled goldsmith from Delft in the Netherlands, who
acted as the supervisor of the <em>Galleria</em> and, next to his own
work, was especially concerned with quality control and timely delivery.
There were special rooms for sawing with water, grinding with emery, and
a storeroom for all the offcuts from semi-precious stone and marbles,
which the artisans could recycle if suitable for other commissions.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>This extensive list immediately elicits a comparison with the
professions represented throughout Ms. Fr. 640. The author-practitioner
too mentions in the many recipes and instructions a wide range of
professions from frame makers, furbishers, iron etchers, glass workers,
metal workers, gilders, cabinet makers, gem cutters, stone sawyers,
alchemists, harquebus makers, painters, gold and silversmiths, to dyers
and fountain builders.</p>
<p>We have gleaned from the historical records of the Florentine
<em>Galleria dei Lavori</em> and the Pesaro <em>botteghini</em> that, in
addition to local talent scouting, there are indications of nationwide
and international recruitment endeavors, particularly in regions
renowned for cultivating superior technical skills. For example, gold-
and silversmiths and cabinet makers from Germany, a French blacksmith,
gem and stone cutters from Milan, and bookbinders from Flanders.
Similarly, in Ms. Fr. 640, references are made to specific international
expertise: painters from Flanders are praised and glassworkers’
techniques from England and Germany are highlighted.</p>
<p>A more detailed practical picture of the organization of the
workshops can be deduced from the Florentine <em>Guardaroba</em>
documents. These documents, varying from ledgers, invoices and receipts,
project descriptions and lists of materials and tools, as well as full
workshop inventories, indicate the manufacture of objects of varying
quality and costs, corresponding to different purposes and markets. The
procuring of materials was centrally organized, and the <em>Guardaroba
Medicea</em> documents contain what now would be described as
spreadsheets, listing materials bought for the various workshops (<i><u>Fig.
1</u></i>). There was also a continuous search for the best materials,
such as semi-precious stones imported from the Middle East, rare rubies
and diamonds bought from reputable merchants, and high-quality pigments
from Venice, at the time the center for the import of raw materials such
as lapis lazuli and its local processing into high quality ultramarine.
Similarly, among Ms. Fr. 640’s entries can be found, for example, silver
made from Spanish coins (fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/164r/f/164r/tl"><u>164r</u></a>)
and morions from Milan (fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/32r/f/32r/tl"><u>32r</u></a>),
lead from Flanders used by the Germans for casting (fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/63r/f/63r/tl"><u>63r</u></a>),
paper from Florence “which is the finest” (fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/82r/f/82r/tl"><u>81r</u></a>).</p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/staging061825-0/images/ann_319_ie_19/1-GDYrOXabUaRuxqo8qqev1LumqPW8WLq.jpg" alt="fig. 1"><figcaption>Fig. 1. “Spreadsheet” of payments for materials for the various
<em>botteghe</em>. Guardaroba Medicea 183, unnumbered folios, Archivio

<p>Household objects to serve the court, as well as objects and
scenography for temporary, ephemeral installations for celebratory
events were produced by the same workshops that made intricate and
precious artifacts for diplomatic gifts or to adorn the ducal palace.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> The extensive collaborations among
employees of different workshops are also evidenced by the archival
documents and the objects made, such as the Barberini cabinet (<i><u>Fig.
2</u></i>), which, as its combination of materials demonstrates, must
have been produced by a rock crystal cutter, workers in <em>pietre
dure</em>, ebony workers, and cabinet makers. Its design, based on
woodcut illustrations of Aesop’s fables (from a 1485 edition by
Francesco Tuppo) with additional flower still lifes, was most likely
provided by the court painter and miniaturist Jacopo Lighozzi
(1547–1627). Such collaborations and hence the potential for exchange of
technical knowledge, stimulated a competitive environment leading to a
taste for technical ingenuity and innovation. In this kind of
environment, skills came more sharply into focus leading to attempts
both to write down processes and to set standards.</p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/staging061825-0/images/ann_319_ie_19/1KFbQ6-jxP6fOBcgh0M0uch-Bm0KLa7WI.jpg" alt="fig. 2"><figcaption>Fig. 2. Barberini cabinet, Galleria dei Lavori, Florence, c.

<p>The range of workshops at the different courts and the regular
changes in the workshops’ occupants, which may have been connected to
the collecting patterns of the sovereign, seems to have given rise to
notes on process, such as a manuscript on miniature painting, dedicated
to Duke Francesco Maria II della Rovere, authored and compiled by the
ducal court miniaturist, Valerio Mariani da Pesaro, mentioned in
Zacconi’s list above as “a singular and rare miniaturist.”<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> Part of the treatise is based on
<em>Ricordi di belli Colori</em>, a small collection of notes presently
in the Vatican library, but originally part of the library of Francesco
Maria II della Rovere. The notes cover technical instructions written by
Gherardo Cibo (1512–1600), a nobleman and amateur botanist and artist
who specialized in botanical illustrations and was well known for making
red lakes and colorants from local plants.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a>
The recipes provide fascinating insight into the Duke’s artistic
interests, as demonstrated by his collection of illuminated manuscripts
of the lives of his famous ancestors, several illuminated by Mariani,
and illustrated copies of Andrea Mattioli’s translation of Dioscorides
<em>Materia Medica</em>, botanical illustrations, as well as
Netherlandish style landscape drawings. The treatise demonstrates an
interest in recording applied knowledge to teach and to set standards of
technical skill for workshop production, aimed at the workshops at the
Pesaro court, where Mariani was employed.</p>
<h2 id="quicchebergs-theatre-and-statecraft"><strong>Quiccheberg’s
Theatre and Statecraft</strong> </h2>
<p>The nineteenth-century historian Antonio Zobi describes how
Ferdinando I de’ Medici, grand duke of Tuscany, educated in Rome in the
arts, sciences, and literature within the splendor of the Papal court,
established the <em>Galleria dei Lavori</em> at the Florentine court as
a political statement: “and wise as he [Ferdinando] was, having
understood that the arts are those which with a most splendid light stud
the diadems of the kings with gems, he tried to protect them, granting
the craftsmen of major reputations favours, distinctions and large
premiums; as they were first-class.”<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> This description of
the aims of establishing the <em>Galleria dei Lavori</em> indicates
succinctly the demand for quality and branding: to metaphorically stud
the diadems of the Kings with the most splendid light, in this case
those of Ferdinando de’ Medici.</p>
<p>The Medici and Pesaro court workshop conglomerates aimed to create a
well-organized production center for crafts administered by the court
and/or state. The exquisite craftsmanship and creativity resulted in
so-called statecraft, its splendor representing the power and
magnificence of its sovereigns. The manufacturing of high-quality
artifacts often coincided with the building of galleries and libraries
at the courts, as well as with the establishment of collections, the
so-called <em>Kunstkammer</em> (chambers of art), filled with
<em>naturalia</em> (nature things) and <em>artificialia</em> (human-made
artifacts).<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> One such <em>Kunstkammer</em> was
that of the Duke of Bavaria, Albrecht V (r. 1550–1579) established in
1563.</p>
<p>In 1565, Albrecht’s librarian, Samuel Quiccheberg, wrote one of the
first treatises on assembling a collection for a <em>Kunstkammer,</em>
<em>Inscriptiones, vel tituli theatri amplissimi</em> (“Inscriptions or
Titles of the Most Ample Theater encompassing particulars of the whole
creation and outstanding images, or . . . a storehouse of artificial and
wonderful things . . . which, for those who spend time to examine and
engage with them, will bring about a singular knowledge of things and
admirable prudence”)<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> (<i><u>Fig.</u>
<u>3</u></i>). In the text, Quiccheberg imagines a complex of buildings
dedicated to art production, collecting, and display, education,
research, and artistic experimentation.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a>
The treatise covers arts, crafts, and measuring instruments and
techniques, with a strong focus on knowledge production and skill, and
aimed at the establishment of a “political showcase for princely
magnificence.”<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a> However, this “showcase” of
objects, as Quiccheberg explains, also serves the state in other ways:
“Indeed, I also judge that it cannot be expressed by any person’s
eloquence how much wisdom and utility in administering the state—as much
in the civil and military spheres as in the ecclesiastical and
cultural—can be gained from the examination and study of the images and
objects we are prescribing.”<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> Quiccheberg allocates
a key role to objects and artifacts in the administration of the state.
On the title page of <em>Inscriptiones</em> he writes that the
<em>Theatre</em> is a “storehouse of artificial and marvelous things.”
He recommends that “these things should be brought together here in the
theater so that by their frequent viewing and handling one might
quickly, easily, and confidently be able to acquire a unique knowledge
and admirable understanding of things.”<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a></p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/staging061825-0/images/ann_319_ie_19/1pp_w4prP56Ha308_BaF7mRmEz1jGt8wC.jpg" alt="fig. 3"><figcaption>Fig. 3.

singularis aliqua rerum cognitio et prudentia admiranda…</em>, 1565.</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>Quiccheberg starts his treatise with a list of “Inscriptions,”
divided over five classes, which present an inventory of the objects
that should be part of a <em>Kunstkammer</em> collection. Quiccheberg’s
list certainly makes for interesting reading, as many of the objects
could be related to the entries in Ms. Fr. 640, as well as to the
purposeful conglomeration of workshops at court discussed above that
provided the sovereign with many magnificent objects, that became part
of collections, and would help to create a “brand” (more on that below).
Without going into every detail, it is fair to say that the
<em>Inscriptiones</em> describe a broad range of objects, ranging from
samples of raw materials such as metals, gems, semi-precious stones, and
earths, to “processed” materials such as “Colors and pigments, such as
those that are spreadable, friable, mineral, water-based, oil-based,
vitreous, and the like,” to rare animals, in some manner of conservation
kept free from decay and dried. Despite the often great technical
detail, there are some more general categories such as “Handiwork of
artisans, made from any sort of metal. For example, the work of
goldsmiths, braziers, clock makers, swordsmiths, and other outstanding
artisans who, through the art of sculpting and founding, produce some
artifacts from any kind of ingot or sheet of metal,” and, he continues,
“Artisanal works of every kind, made from wood, stone, gems, woven
fabrics, and other materials of the most diverse kinds. Items produced
by the art of turners, plasterers, fine sculptors, glassblowers,
embroiderers, weavers, and those who create other artifacts of this sort
besides those listed above.”<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a> Not only artisans are
listed, but also painters, both in oil and water color, printmakers,
scientific instrument makers, as well as manufacturers of props and
ephemera constructions for festivals, spectacles, and other political
events. Add to this the many descriptions of tools as part of the
theater: “Instruments for workshops and laboratories used by the most
skilled artisans, such as the tools of sculptors, turners, goldsmiths,
foundry workers, woodworkers, and indeed of all artisans whom this world
supports in our age.”<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>Quiccheberg describes in the second part of his treatise where all
these artifacts, tools, and materials are displayed, made, and stored:
“Museums, Workshops, and Storerooms, Such as Are meant for Furnishing
Wisdom and Pleasing Arts, Which are sometimes Constructed Separately in
Palaces and Sometimes joined together.”<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24" role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a>
The <em>Galleria di Lavori</em> at the Medici court in Florence, the
Pesaro <em>botteghini</em> that was added to the Ducal Palace together
with a new gallery and library, and other examples at European courts,
seem to follow a similar formula as Quiccheberg’s concept for the
Bavarian court. Quiccheberg emphasizes the educational aspect of his
Theater and its potential for the “inspiring leader” to study every kind
of discipline and matter through objects and materials since, as he
states, “all those topics are present that universal nature embraces,
that all books teach, that all of human life can offer, it is perfectly
clear that no discipline can be taught, no work of art examined, no
state of life imagined, that does not have its foundations, equipment,
means of support, or examples here in the theater.” The “aspiring
leader,” if familiar with “a certain style of learning, and has examined
what things should be considered as similar, different, opposite, or in
a further subordinate class—it cannot be but that in the shortest time,
without great exertion and dangers or troubles (which would in general
have to be faced in the investigation of things), he will acquire
unbelievable practical knowledge regarding everything and a manifestly
divine wisdom.”<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25" role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p>Thus, the formation of institutionalized workshops, administered by
the court, occurred in tandem with the establishment and building of art
galleries, <em>Kunstkammer</em>, and libraries. Furthermore, the
ever-expanding diplomatic and political networking required signature
gifts. This, and the rapid development of a merchant class and increased
urbanization, led to new market demands and hence the development of
novel, sometimes more efficient, manufacturing methods, and quality
standards for production. The court workshops should be placed at the
center of this all, as they were established to strengthen the
sovereign’s cultural, economic, and political status through
high-quality manufacture of artifacts with a strong element of identity
“branding.” The need for the development of political and cultural
identities through objects and artifacts led to statecraft with a
specific style, technical ingenuity, and innovation in a specific
discipline, constructing an artistic court identity or branding.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26" role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a> For example, highly skilled
<em>pietre dure</em> work could be—and still is—associated with the
Florentine Medici court as their specialized workshops were renowned for
their innovative and rather secretive technical skills and designs,
often the result of collaborations between painters such as Jacopo
Lighozzi and the <em>pietre dure</em> artisans.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27" role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="statecraft-cities-and-branding"><strong>Statecraft, Cities, and
Branding</strong></h2>
<p>Quichberg’s <em>Inscriptiones</em> provide a framework for such
statecraft, cultural identity, and branding, leading to courts as well
as urban environments where such frameworks are actively developed by
court administrations for cultural, political, and economic reasons.
Such frameworks go back to the physical branding of objects in medieval
times and relate to the guilds and their systematic ways of controlling
quality and setting standards, with “the hallmark as visual
manifestation.”<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a> Although this varied according to
region and type of trade, Bert De Munck considers guild officials who
applied such hallmarks as “an extension of either merchants or the
manufacturing masters themselves,” describing the marks as brand
development or even franchising.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29" role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a> For example, in the
early seventeenth century, the Antwerp brand of two hands and a tower on
the back of oak panels used as a support for paintings, acknowledged the
location of production and confirmed the guild ordinances, sealing the
quality of the product. In addition, the panel maker would also brand
his work with his initials (<i><u>Fig.</u>
<u>4</u></i>).<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30" role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a> The criteria used to apply a
hallmark imply a value judgment, not only about the quality of the
materials and manufacturing process, but also about the level of skill
of the actual masters in the guilds and their trustworthiness in
particular, which places branding of artifacts into both economic and
political systems. Although a discussion of quality control and branding
used by the guilds is beyond the scope of this essay, the systematic,
sometimes competing, controls by local guilds of material and technical
quality at times resulted in brand differentiation between cities.</p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/staging061825-0/images/ann_319_ie_19/1C5PYbzM70QeKXjASjfPwebKM6ZdzX0kC.jpg" alt="fig. 4"><figcaption>Fig. 4.

<p>In the mid to late sixteenth century, urbanization led to what De
Munck and Bellavitis describe as “creative cities.”<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31" role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a>
They state that the “self-evident idea that Renaissance cities were
‘creative’ as they were the centers of every kind of exchange—human,
economic, cultural—is the result of a long-time history.” The growth of
the city in a material, economic, and demographic sense was closely
related to the “narratives, discourses, and imaginaries about the fame
of the city and the talents of its inhabitants.”<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32" role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a>
Such creative cities, with administration centers often led by the court
or urban aristocracy, would provide the ideal environment for the
movement of what Rens Bod coined as “cognitive goods: shared epistemic
tools of knowledge-making disciplines that can be transferred across
disciplinary boundaries.”<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33" role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a> Guilds still played a
role, and they, together with the urban authorities and aristocracy,
stimulated the development of technical knowledge and innovation, by
giving privileges to talented highly skilled artists, artisans, and
inventors from outside the city, offering them membership of local
guilds, patents for their products, and other incentives.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34" role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a>
The skills of the artisans and the high quality of their products
contributed to the development of a trademark connected to the city’s
name, and the provision of a recognized reference for its products, such
as Murano glassware and Limoges enamel, a system still in use today,
and, as many recent discussions on the ownership of such trademarks
show, closely connected to politics and economics.</p>
<p>This line of political thought is echoed in various contemporary
political accounts, such as in <em>Delle cause della grandezza delle
citta</em> (1588) (“On the causes of the greatness and magnificence of
cities”) by the Italian philosopher and political writer Giovanni Botero
(1544–1617)<em>.</em> Originally trained as a Jesuit, Botero spent a
substantial period of time, from ca. 1586 to ca. 1595, at the papal
court of Cardinal Federico Borromeo (1564–1631) in Rome, which proved to
be formative years for his anti-Machiavellian and Catholic writings. His
chapter, “On Industry,” is of interest for our reflection on branding
through artisanal excellence, in both urban and court environments.
Botero states “Nothing is more important for causing a state to grow …
than industry and a great number of crafts.”<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35" role="doc-noteref"><sup>35</sup></a>
He explains how “From this comes a flow of money and people, who are
workers or who deal in the finished goods, or who supply workers with
materials, or who buy, sell and transport the ingenious products from
human hands and minds from one place to another,” firmly placing
artisanal production in a political and economic context. These workers
making the “ingenious products from human hands and minds” are the
artisans, the manufacturers, and, he goes on, “things made by skilled
human hands are far more numerous and costly than those produced by
nature,” explaining it is human ingenuity that, for example, makes “the
filthy secretion of a lowly caterpillar into something prized by princes
and esteemed by queens, and finally sought after by everyone for
adornment,” which “support a large numbers of inhabitants with jobs and
far outstrips what trade in natural resources can provide.”<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36" role="doc-noteref"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<p>Indeed, Botero emphasizes, following his Machiavellian interests, how
industry plays an equally crucial role for the running of a prosperous
court and the status of its sovereign: “a prince who wishes his city to
be well populated must establish all kinds of crafts and industries
there, which he can do by bringing in skilled artisans from other
countries and giving them suitable workplaces and lodgings, by taking
more ingenious minds and appreciating the rare and singular inventions
they devise, and by offering prizes for perfection and excellence.”<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37" role="doc-noteref"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="paris-logements"><strong>Paris <em>Logements</em></strong></h2>
<p>The necessary provision of workplaces and lodgings in a city and/or
at the court, as seen in both the Florentine and Pesaro courts, was
crucial to attract skilled artisans and hence assure high quality.
Another somewhat later example can also be found in the so-called
<em>Logements</em> in Paris. On December 22, 1608, a Royal Letters
Patent was issued for the establishment of twenty-seven
<em>logements</em> and ateliers for “Maitres des Arts et Mestiers” in
the Louvre palace in Paris.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38" role="doc-noteref"><sup>38</sup></a> The <em>logements</em>
were located on the ground floor of the <em>Grande Galerie</em>, which
was built along the banks of the Seine by Henri IV, King of France
(1553-1610), as part of an impressive program of restoration and
building projects in Paris. The Patent explains that the aim of this
project was</p>
<blockquote>
<p>to arrange the building in such a form that we can comfortably lodge
there a number of the best […] masters who could cover, painting,
sculpture, gold smithery, clock making, cutting jewels, and many others
of best excellent arts, so much to serve us from here, as if to be among
the same means employed by our subjects in that they would need their
industry, and also to create something like a nursery for workers from
which, under the apprenticeship of such good masters, several would come
who later would spread throughout our kingdom and who would know how to
serve the public very well.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39" role="doc-noteref"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="pull-left"></span>Henri IV, like the other sovereigns discussed in this essay, wanted
to regulate the arts and crafts and protect the artists and artisans
“against the anxious jealousy and the enterprises of less skillful and
less favored colleagues.”<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40" role="doc-noteref"><sup>40</sup></a> The emphasis on
quality is again at the forefront, and the descriptions of the occupants
of each <em>logement</em> regularly emphasize their ingenious skills and
technical innovations. For example, a certain Ferrier receives
permission on October 2, 1607, to occupy a <em>logement</em> in the
Grande Galerie. He is a master watchmaker who through the “proofs and
experiences he has given of his inventions and works of all kinds of
instruments of mechanics and of mathematics and generally of all works
of the lathe, the hammer, and the file,” qualified for this obviously
prestigious establishment, due to his novel and highly skilled
techniques.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41" role="doc-noteref"><sup>41</sup></a></p>
<p>The list of artisans makes interesting reading, showing that all
received a court appointment as well as an appointment as <em>valet de
chambre</em> of, for example, <em>La Reine</em>, the Queen, or of the
<em>Duc d’Orleans</em>. Some of the artisans were found through
international relations, such as Pierre Courtois, goldsmith, who around
1600 was the “goldsmith and enameller” of the Duchess of Florence,
Christine de Lorraine, spouse of Ferdinando I, and hence formerly
employed at the <em>Galleria dei Lavori</em>.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42" role="doc-noteref"><sup>42</sup></a>
The royal Patent states that the masters employed may take two
apprentices each and are supposed to work for the city of Paris only,
and that, for example, the goldsmiths will brand every object with their
city of Paris hallmark.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43" role="doc-noteref"><sup>43</sup></a> The apprentices are those who will
spread the learned skills throughout the kingdom and no doubt through
the court’s many diplomatic gifts.</p>
<p>Surveying the aims and contexts of these three court-based projects,
the twenty-first-century definition of creative industries as “those
based on individual creativity, skill and talent, or which have the
potential to create wealth and jobs through the development or
production of intellectual property,” to which I alluded in the
introduction of this essay, seems totally appropriate.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44" role="doc-noteref"><sup>44</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>As apprentices, some of the <em>Logements</em>’ artisans with their
innovative technical knowledge may have passed through the Languedoc
region where the author-practitioner of Ms. Fr. 640 most likely
practiced and wrote his manuscript, entering his own technical knowledge
and compiling that of other practitioners. When set against the court
workshop clusters in Florence and Pesaro, as well as the Paris
<em>Logements</em>, and the political and economic rationales behind
them, the detailed artisanal and artistic recipes and instructions of
Ms. Fr. 640, many of them experimented and tested by the
author-practitioner, can plausibly be seen in this light, thus setting
the manuscript apart from the Books of Secrets literature. Indeed, Ms.
Fr. 640 can be even more closely linked to statecraft through its
connection to Philippe de Béthune (1561-1649), who wrote in his 1633
<em>Le conseiller d’Estat</em> that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Prudence, as befits a Prince, must be accompanied by a universal
knowledge of all sorts of sciences, not in detail, as if to make them
his trade and profession; but he must know as much as is necessary to
discern truth from falsehood and understand those who converse upon it
as it may happen. His trade is not to be an Engineer, to build houses,
to erect a bridge, to be a good cannon founder, but to recognize those
who are best suited, and to make sensible use of people from all sorts
of professions.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45" role="doc-noteref"><sup>45</sup></a></p>
