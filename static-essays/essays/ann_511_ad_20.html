        <div>
            <p>Over a third of Ms. Fr. 640 is devoted to mold making and metal
                casting, and, among these long and detailed entries are the
                accounts of many first hand trials of lifecasting. It is clear
                that lifecasting was a major preoccupation (perhaps <em>the</em>
                major preoccupation) of the author-practitioner. The folios
                pertaining to it contain the longest and most densely written
                entries, with numerous marginal additions, copious recounting of
                first hand experience, and many remarkable sketches, making them
                among the most complicated but rewarding for the modern
                reader-practitioner to decipher.</p>

    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
    <p>Ms. Fr. 640 is remarkably informative about a rich variety of making
        processes, often including details not mentioned in any other known
        textual source. Over a third of the manuscript is devoted to mold making
        and metal casting, and, among these long and detailed entries are the
        accounts of many first hand trials of lifecasting.<a href="#fn1"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref1"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> The process of lifecasting was
        not uncommon in the sixteenth century, and inventories list lifecast
        animals and plants, with many examples still extant today (<i><u>Fig.
                1</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 2</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 3</u></i>,
        <i><u>Fig. 4</u></i>). Such objects emerged out of an intense interest
        in this period in the imitation of nature by art. Imitating the artifice
        of nature by the artifice of the human hand is the aim of numerous
        processes in Ms. Fr. 640, as it was in many other artefacts of art and
        architecture in early modern Europe.</p>

    <p>The process of molding and casting from life produced a lifelike metal
        simulacrum of plants and animals by forming a plaster mold from the body
        of the live plant or recently-killed animal. While other printed sources
        give the outlines of this process, Ms. Fr. 640 provides observations on
        the habits of animals used for casting, including instructions for
        catching, feeding, keeping, and killing them, along with extremely
        detailed first hand experimentation in molding and casting them. The
        author-practitioner treats lifecasting in dense passages from fol. <a

        and many more.</p>
    <p>The author-practitioner’s intense engagement with lifecasting in the
        manuscript starts with three entries about catching and keeping
        nightingales that are interspersed with grafting and gardening
        instructions on fol. <a

           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/106r/f/106r/tc"><u>106r</u></a>,
        under the heading “For casting,” he begins to assemble materials for
        molding and casting, along with comments on their properties and where
        they might be sourced. For seven extremely packed pages, he discusses
        materials: clay on which to pose the animals, necessary ingredients for
        the molding “sand” (<em>sable</em>)—sal ammoniac, bismuth, feather alum,
        crocum ferri (rusted metal filings), plaster, tiles (to be
        pulverized)—and for other materials needed in the process such as wax
        for making the gate and the sprues, and eau-de-vie (used as a release
        agent), as well as sourcing the animals themselves (<i><u>Fig.
                5</u></i>).</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>The <sup>very</sup> big ones usually have hairy feet, which are
            vexing to mold if you do not lay them flat, or burn them with a
            candle, or stiffen them &amp; lay them flat <del>with some</del>,
            anointing them with wheat oil. Kill them in vinegar &amp; urine,
            like snakes <del>&amp;</del>, or in eau-de-vie, and then shape them
            on a well-made vine leaf or other thing. Next, you can give them
            back their capricious hair with <em>
                <del>bourr</del>
            </em> the sieved fine hair of cloth waste, having anointed them
            <del>with a</del> with fish glue or similar. Their true color is of
            vinegar &amp; verdet, &amp; then fumigate them in various places
            with sulfur. Having made your <em>
                <del>tourt</del>
            </em> clay slab, place on it your vine leaf, and the dead spider in
            the middle, &amp; pierce with a point of iron or latten wire the
            middle of the spider’s body &amp; the leaf together. Next, place
            diagonally small points of latten wire around the vine leaf to
            secure it well. Then fix, with a little melted wax and the point of
            a hot iron wire, the end of the legs, adapting them with the end of
            small pincers. Do the same thing with the end of the small cornicles
            of the spider. Once the wax is cool, scrape the excess with the
            point of a penknife in order that the end of the legs stay neat.
            Next, place the circle of earth around &amp; cast your tempered
            sand, like for other things. In this manner, you will need to burn
            the vine leaf in the mold, otherwise not. And to cast more easily,
            let the animal die fully, in order that, when struggling, it does
            not mix up its legs. Having made your first cast, uncover the
            reverse of the leaf and make the second cast. To make the gate for
            the spider on the leaf and to prevent the sand from covering the
            spider from underneath the belly, furnish the end of the tail &amp;
            the bottom of the body with a little wax, melted &amp; applied with
            the hot iron wire, as you know. In this way, when the leaf burns
            &amp; the wax is melted, there will remain two little holes in the
            leaf which will be the gate of the spider (fol. <a
               href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/129v/f/129v/tl"><u>129v</u></a>).
        </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>It is characteristic of these entries that
        they mix observations about animal behavior with comments on the
        behavior of molding materials and metals. Over the sixty folios
        following fol. 105, the author-practitioner penned multiple entries on
        the entire process of casting from life: catching, keeping, feeding, and
        killing animals, arranging the animal on a clay base, then pouring
        plaster molds around the animals and plants, burning out or otherwise
        removing these organic models from the mold, cleaning the molds of the
        ashes, binding the multi-piece molds together, pouring metal into the
        void left by the burned-out or removed creature, detaching the mold from
        the cast object, removing the mold infrastructure and metal flashing
        (where the molten metal leaked out of the sides of the mold), and making
        any necessary repairs where the cast failed. Although the
        author-practitioner is quite comprehensive in his account of
        lifecasting, he is by no means methodical about his exposition. The
        entries on lifecasting are interspersed with many, many other processes,
        and even in the entries themselves, he loops back multiple times to
        repeat and modify slightly the processes, apparently writing down
        additional information as it occurred to him, and filling the margins
        with comments and notes. He does, however, seem to be attempting to
        cover all parts of the process of lifecasting in the compass of these
        almost seventy folios from <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/106v/f/106v/tc"><u>106v</u></a>
        through <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/170r/f/170r/tc"><u>170r</u></a>.
    </p>
    <p>It is clear that lifecasting was a major preoccupation (perhaps

    <p>Casting from life goes back to antiquity, and is mentioned by the
        fourteenth-century painter Cennino Cennini in his <em>Libro dell’
            Arte</em>. Instructions for casting from life were collected,
        printed, and reprinted into the eighteenth century.<a href="#fn2"

        Plat (1552–1608), a brewer’s son and irrepressible collector of recipes,
        recorded processes for casting plants and animals in <em>The Jewell
            House of Art and Nature conteining divers rare and profitable

        contemporaneous with Ms. Fr. 640. In the fourth book, entitled “The Art

        flower, or of any patterne of mettall, wax, &amp;c. into gold, silver,
        plaister, &amp;c.,” contains detailed instructions for casting a branch
        of rosemary as a lost-pattern cast; two-piece molds “if you woulde save
        your patternes”; casting in glue and wax molds that are flexible and
        capable of being removed from undercut work; sulphur molds; breadcrumb
        molds; box molds and core molds; molding a man’s face and hands; killing
        insects, frogs, and toads in order to mold them; and papier-maché

    <p>From the number of printed sources and lifecast objects in
        sixteenth-century collections, it is clear that this was a widely known
        and much desired technique for at least three centuries. This textual
        and material evidence points to the popularity of lifecasts among
        collectors in the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries. The
        inventories of the <em>Kunstkammern</em> of the Wittelsbachs in Bavaria
        and of the Habsburgs contain of hundreds of lifecasts in silver, tin,
        lead, plaster, and other media, and the eagerness with which they were
        sought can be detected in the anxious letters between Wenzel Jamnitzer
        and Archduke Ferdinand of Austria (1564–1602) between 1556 and 1562
        about a commission to build a fountain with animals cast from life
        around the base.<a href="#fn4"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref4"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> Another example of this interest
        can be found in a letter from an official at the court of Grand Duke
        Francesco I de’ Medici (1541–87) to Duke Wilhelm V of Bavaria
        (1548–1626) that details a “Pergkhwerckhstuckh” (a <em>Handstein</em>
        combining goldsmith’s work with natural mineral specimens), that the
        Grand Duke was sending to Wilhelm. It included lifecast lead patterns
        for plants that were to be attached to the work. A postscript to the
        letter states that the live frogs, snakes, plants, and other animals
        that the duke desired could not be obtained due to the inclement
        weather.<a href="#fn5"

    <p>Lifecasts were produced in great numbers throughout Europe in the
        sixteenth century, particularly in Italy and in the southern German
        lands, especially Nuremberg, where lifecasting was a well-known
        technique by the first half of the sixteenth century, reaching a high
        point in the work of the Nuremberg master goldsmith Wenzel Jamnitzer
        (1508–85).</p>

    <p>One of the most distinctive aspects of Ms. Fr. 640’s entries on
        lifecasting is their detail about the catching and keeping of animals to
        be used as the patterns for lifecasting. These entries include
        observations on the habits, and likes and dislikes of animals, thus
        providing a fascinating window into the engagement with and

    <blockquote>
        <p>Snakes can be caught by hand, provided that it is covered by a thick
            woollen cloth, for the teeth of the snake stay in the cloth &amp;
            cannot pierce like they would with a linen. The dangerous ones are
            recognized by their blue &amp; <em>
                <del>asses</del>
            </em> <em>aseures</em><sup>azure</sup> eyes. They hardly ever bite
            in water, which crayfish catchers experience (fol. <a
               href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/107r/f/107r/tl"><u>107r</u></a>).
        </p>
        <p>****</p>
        <p>When you take [snakes] for molding, if it is possible, do not remove
            their teeth if you want to keep them. For, having had their teeth
            removed, they get sore gums &amp; mouth, &amp; can no longer eat.
            You can keep them in a barrel full of bran or even better of earth,
            in a cool place, or in a glass bottle. And give them any live frog
            or other little live animal, for they do not eat anything dead.
            Also, I have noticed that when they want to bite or eat something,
            they do not bite with a direct attack but with sinuous turns &amp;
            from the side, as do Satan &amp; his disciples. It has a small head
            but a very long body. The entryway to sin seems small &amp;
            inconsequential, but the consequences of it are very great. It
            abstains from eating seven or eight days, once it has devoured some
            frog. It can swallow three or four of them, one after the other, and
            what it devoured is neither corrupted nor consumed in one go in its
            stomach, but <em>
                <del>p</del>
            </em> some part little by little, that is to say bones and
            everything. And the remains are found as fresh as when it had
            devoured them, such that sometimes, when one presses &amp; torments
            it, it renders up what it has engulfed, parts of which are found
            totally consumed &amp; others as fresh as if it were alive. It can
            keep a frog engulfed for two to three hours &amp; renders it up
            completely alive. When it is big, one needs to mold it hollow, &amp;
            if you want to make it have an open mouth, put some cotton inside,
            &amp; then on the cotton some melted wax (fol. <a

    <h4 id="birds">Birds</h4>
    <p>Ms. Fr. 640 contains several entries on catching wild birds, with
        observations on their migratory habits, favorite foods, and illnesses.
        Perhaps the author-practitioner himself kept birds.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Calandra larks &amp; all birds taken from the nest &amp; which have
            not had freedom are better, for these which are taken by net never
            sing so well. However, the wild ones give <em>
                <del>[illegible]</del>
            </em> much pleasure with their chanting, but they ought be taken
            before St. Michael, otherwise they scarcely live. A small impostume
            occurs on all on the fork of their tail, occasionally, which some
            call <em>gaillardise</em>, which makes them sick &amp; sometimes
            makes them die, especially calandra larks. One knows this when they
            are sad &amp; do not sing. One must pierce it <em>
                <del>av</del>
            </em>, not with a pin, but very gently by turning with the tip of
            quite pointy feather. The calandra lark does not want to be without
            <del>grey</del> river sand, &amp; the grey is the best, a little
            coarse. It rubs itself in it &amp; purges itself with it (fol. <a
               href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/49v/f/49v/tl"><u>49v</u></a>).
        </p>
        <p>****</p>
        <p>Those that <del>can</del> are taken at St. Michael are good for
            keeping, but those that are taken in March die, because they are
            starting to fall into love. Ortolans are fed on oats all summer in
            order that they are nourished without becoming fat, to be more
            appropriate for hunting &amp; catching others. Then, when one wants
            to fatten them for selling, one gives them millet. They sing at
            night. One needs to <em>
                <del>c</del>
            </em> take them after mid-July until St. Michael, for after that
            time when they have their young in this country, they go [<del>t
            </del>] away like turtledoves do. Siskins should also be taken from
            All Saints’ Day until Christmas, for after that they go to the
            mountains to brood.</p>
        <p>****</p>
        <p>
            <strong>Small birds</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Ortolans sing at night if they are left in the <em>serain</em> [cool
            evening air], but they are better for fattening for fine tables than
            for singing. Chaffinches are prone to becoming blind, &amp; their
            eyes become swollen at the beginning of August. Goldfinches like
            lettuce seeds very much, &amp; often one catches them in gardens on
            seeded lettuces with two lime twigs. But because such regular fare
            would be too expensive for them, they are ordinarily fed with hemp
            seed. The <em>passe solitaire</em> is purged with a spider, which
            one needs to give to it once a week in order that no
            <em>gaillardisse</em> comes to it. The calandra is purged with dry
            mortar, composed of lime &amp; sand to keep it from
            <em>gaillardise</em> &amp; fattening too much. Young small birds are
            purged with the same dry mortar, by putting some pieces in their
            cages. The cuckoo lays in the nest of ortolans otherwise called
            <em>verdaule</em>. This bird is very simple. In the past, I have
            given leave to two of them, which after several days returned to
            their cage. For feeding young goldfinches, one needs to pestle
            almonds with <del>pith</del> <sup>a very little amount of bread
                pith</sup> and lettuce seed or hemp seed. If it is for linnet,
            some rapeseed (fol. <a

            throughout the room &amp; through the window, and all will enclose

        between entries for cultivation and grafting.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>The nightingale, as long as it sings, maintains a territory for
            itself alone. Approach, therefore, making as if searching the ground
            for something. And taking some worms which come from old meal or
            from beneath kneading troughs or mills, which it is fond of, put
            some on your hat attached with a pin or otherwise, in order that it
            wiggles. And at five or six paces from the hedge where it sings,
            make a hole in the ground &amp; put in some worms and your device of
            little crossed sticks. It will be anxious for you to leave so it can
            go see what you have done, and seeing worms, it will enter.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>Notes on the keeping nightingales are
        especially full of detail:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>It is necessary that the iron wire of its cage be of the thickest, in
            order that, thinking of leaving, it will not be hurt. Cover, from
            the moment that it is taken, its cage with canvas. One needs to feed
            it the first day, <del>giving</del> <em>
                <del>uy</del>
            </em> taking it out from its cage into the hand &amp; opening its
            beak, &amp; with a small wooden pin, put it in its throat &amp; make
            it swallow. And continue thus until it is no longer opinionated.
            This is done for sustaining it, for if it were to become thin, it
            would die.</p>
        <p>****</p>
        <p>One needs for the cage, made like those for larks like a barn &amp;
            lined with green fabric, to be made with a drawer underneath, to
            refresh its fresh earth everyday, for it takes much delight in this,
            &amp; mix in it some ants. You can carry an anthill with its earth
            in a barrel full of earth, &amp; keep them there &amp; they will lay
            their eggs there, in order to always have some at hand when you want
            them, should you take pleasure in feeding nightingales. When you
            have taken it, it is fat &amp; full, &amp; thus, to keep it in its
            strength, one needs to, for the first day, take <em>
                <del>uy</del>
            </em> it in the hand &amp; open its beak &amp; put in its beak with
            a small pointed stick some mutton heart or other delicate flesh,
            chopped up not too finely, in order to fill its belly &amp; keep it
            from diminishing &amp; growing leaner, until it has gotten over its
            fancy. <del>The next day you will give him</del> And you will feed
            it in this way three or four times a day &amp; will also make it
            drink. The next morning, you will give it in its cage some
            well-minced flesh with the yolk of a hard-boiled egg, and change it
            two or three times a day, for it will not eat it if it is hardened
            &amp; if it is not fresh. And if it goes half a day without eating,
            one needs to feed it as before &amp; do so until it eats by itself.
            And to entice it better, you could add amongst the meat &amp; the
            egg some live mealworms, for it is very fond of them (fol. <a

    <p>Instructions for keeping snakes are not quite as detailed as for
        nightingales, but are discussed multiple times. Snakes should be kept
        “in a barrel full of bran or even better of earth, in a cool place, or
        in a glass bottle” (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/109r/f/109r/tl"><u>109r</u></a>).
        The snake should be protected from harm in order to keep it eating:
        “When it has eaten something, by tormenting it, it renders it up. And
        if, after having eaten something, it is thus pressed underfoot, this
        pains it greatly &amp; hurts it. If it is wounded, it will not eat
        willingly.” Snakes should be fed live frogs, rather than dead ones. It
        was important to have the animal eat because “in three [days], it is
        almost as thin as it will be afterward if it does not eat. Molding it
        very soon after it is caught is best, before it becomes thin. One ought
        to put it to death only a quarter of an hour before you want to mold”
        (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/110r/f/110r/tl"><u>110r</u></a>).

            <strong>Putting to death the animal for molding</strong>
        </p>
        <p>You need to be careful not to wound it in taking it. And, having put
            it in a glass bottle <em>
                <del>d</del>
            </em> with bran, or in a barrel <del>full</del> half full of fresh
            &amp; humid earth, if you want to store them or keep them a long
            time, give them live frogs &amp; not dead ones to eat. For if you
            keep them without feeding them, they wither &amp; grow thin &amp;
            have long wrinkled <em>
                <del>aulx</del>
            </em> skins. Thus the best would be to mold it as soon as <del>after
            </del> possible <em>
                <del>apre</del>
            </em> after it has been taken. But before, put it to death in this
            way. Place it in a clean bottle or vessel so that it would collect
            no dust. And put inside such a quantity of good vinegar &amp; urine
            that it can be covered. And shake it &amp; torment it therein until
            it is dead, which will be in an hour or a half. But if you are in a
            hurry to cast, make him take through the mouth some good eau-de-vie
            or else mix a little with the vinegar. And soon it will be dead,
            without any lesion which deforms it. For large animals, for whom one
            would need a lot of eau-de-vie, one uses vinegar and <em>
                <del>er</del>
            </em> urine. But for small ones, only eau-de-vie, which is done
            sooner. When your animal is dead, take it out &amp; clean it
            carefully of its old skin, if it sheds, or of the filth, or of the
            lice, like lizards have, and then arrange it thus. Now, put enough
            in a glass, &amp; soak &amp; continually keep in it the head of the
            animal, or the whole of it, if it is not big (fol. <a

        underscores the necessity of making certain the animal is dead: “to know
        if it is quite dead, take it out of the vinegar and take it by the tail.
        If it moves it, do not mold it for it still has feeling, &amp; when
        piercing it, it would draw back &amp; spoil the mold.”</p>
    <h3 id="posing-animals">Posing Animals</h3>
    <p>Published instructions for lifecasting, such as Plat’s, agree in general
        terms with the instructions in Ms. Fr. 640, but the manuscript provides
        invaluable technical details, including the precise method of posing the
        animals on the clay base—including information-rich marginal drawings of
        this hard-to-describe process (<i><u>Fig. 7</u></i>, <i><u>Fig.
                8</u></i>)—and the design of the channels through which the
        metal flows into the mold (<i><u>Fig. 9</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 10</u></i>).
        Sixteenth-century objects extant in collections today show that the
        techniques recounted in Ms. Fr. 640 were employed. For example, the
        author-practitioner describes the process of passing pins through the
        animals’ feet to the clay beneath, either by threading wire through
        these holes or leaving the pins in place, in order to hold the animal in
        place on the clay slab (<i><u>Fig. 11</u></i>). The pins are then
        removed from the other side of the mold when the plaster for the second
        half of the two-piece mold is poured (fols. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/112v/f/112v/tl"><u>112v</u></a>–<a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/114v/f/114v/tl"><u>114r</u></a>).
        These pins leave a very small void in the plaster that fills with metal
        during casting, and which must be clipped off the metal cast. One of the
        most impressive sixteenth-century examples of lifecasting, almost
        certainly by Wenzel Jamnitzer, shows the traces of this technique.</p>

                The remarkable detail of this lizard was achieved by molding and
                casting according to techniques detailed in Ms. Fr. 640, fol.
                124v. Evidence for this is visible in the slightly raised oval
                area on its tail, which indicates the location of the gate
                through which the mold was filled with metal. This gate was
                filed off after casting. The casting seam along the middle of
                the tail shows where the mold halves met. <a

        molding all large animals (including snakes, lizards, stag beetles, and
        rats) in two-piece molds. Birds, and particularly their feet (<i><u>Fig.

        of a snake in a straight position, into which they then cast wax. They
        then twist the wax snake into whatever position they desire: “And others
        mold lengthwise a natural snake, without it being curled, with common

    <p>The manuscript also contains instructions for making casts of amphibians,
        in particular toads and turtles, by a process of indirect casting.
        Indirect casting involves making a wax inter-model in a plaster mold for
        which an animal formed the original pattern, filling this wax model with
        a core of refractory (heat-resistant) material held in place by wires or
        pins, and then investing (covering) the wax pattern and its core with
        plaster. The wax is then melted out and metal is cast into the void
        space left by the wax. The surface of the piece resulting from this
        indirect cast will always be slightly less sharply detailed than the
        solid-cast animal, but this process has the advantage of producing an
        object that uses less metal, is lighter, and cools more evenly,
        resulting in fewer casting flaws. Because the description of this
        process in the manuscript is not nearly as detailed as, for example, the
        positioning of the animals on the clay base, it is unclear whether the
        author believed this process was self-evident, or whether he was not
        practiced in it. Moreover, the author provides a rather unusual version
        of indirect casting and frequently makes the point that although larger
        animals—toads, rats, birds, and turtles—should be cast hollow so they
        are not too weighty, it is a very time-consuming process, mentioning
        that in the time it takes to mold one turtle hollow, dozens of flower
        molds could be made (<a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/150v/f/150v/tl"><u>fols.

           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/151r/f/151r/tl"><u>151r</u></a>).
    </p>
    <p>For producing hollow casts of turtles, the author specifies that the
        animal should be molded in a two-piece or multipiece mold as usual, and
        then burned out (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/144r/f/144r/tl"><u>144r</u></a>–<a

           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/151v/f/151v/tl"><u>151v</u></a>).
        The ashes should be cleaned out and then the mold reassembled. While it
        is still open, a metal wire should be threaded through the hollow center
        of the mold. At this point, a hole is made in the hardened plaster in
        the middle of the belly side of the mold and a raised lip formed around
        it. The mold is then reassembled and clamped tightly. A mixture of half
        tallow and half wax is slushed in through the hole in the mold. When the
        excess wax is poured out and hardened, a liquid core is poured into the
        mold through the same hole. This core is to be composed of the same
        material as the original mold (made of plaster, brick, iron filings, and
        feather alum). The raised lip of the hole is sheared off, the mold luted
        with the original plaster mixture, and the wax gently melted out through
        the hole in the mold. The mold is now ready to be cast with a mixture of
        lead and tin. Without the illustrations, it would be hard to make sense
        of this process (<i><u>Fig. 49</u></i>).</p>

    <p>The author-practitioner offers another tantalizingly fragmentary method
        for indirect casts of small snakes and lizards that involves coating the
        mold with butter, then lining the inside of the mold with a “lasagne” of
        paste (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/130v/f/130v/tl"><u>130v</u></a>).
        Plat’s <em>Jewell House</em> explains the process more clearly: line the
        insides of a mold with a thin paste composed of “tough” flour and water
        and made into a uniform thickness with a rolling pin; brush the paste
        with a thin coating of melted bacon grease; place wires through the mold
        lengthwise and crosswise, then pour the plaster into this egg-shaped
        cavity (which forms the core). Finally, take apart the two parts of the
        mold and remove the paste; hang the core in the mold again, using the
        crossed wires to hold it in place; and then lute the entire mold, anneal
        it, and pour the metal into it.<a href="#fn16"

    <h3 id="burning-out-the-organic-matter">Burning Out the Organic Matter</h3>
    <p>Although the author-practitioner mentions that fresh animals could be
        removed from their two-piece mold, it seems he mostly burned them out,
        noting that some were harder to burn out than others. Bird feet, for
        example, were impossible to burn, thus needed to be molded in a piece
        mold in order to remove them for the metal pour (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/157v/f/157v/tl"><u>157v</u></a>).
        Crayfish were “awkward” to burn in the mold (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/142r/f/142r/tl"><u>142r</u></a>).
        Plants molded in a one-piece mold always necessitated burning out, but
        the process of removing the ashes could be difficult. The process of
        burning out also melted out the wax gate, sprues, and vents to create a
        void through which the metal could enter the mold.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>After your molds have their gate, vents &amp; clamps, as is said,
            make at the end of the forge <del>in</del>, or in some clean place,
            a surrounding of bricks, and fill it with large half-lit charcoals.
            And place your molds on top, and leave the charcoals thus to kindle
            by themselves for a half hour, so that they heat little by little
            and not all at once. Finally, as they will begin to become white,
            beat <del>little by little</del> the thus half-lit large charcoals
            on top &amp; blow with your little bellows until they are warmed.
            And thus, little <sup>by little</sup>, invigorate the fire, without
            haste, until your molds are quite red on the outside &amp; the
            inside. If it is for casting some plant or some animal which does
            not release well, &amp; if, for this reason, one needs to burn
            <sup>it</sup> in the mold, &amp; when you look through the gate,
            &amp; through it, you see the molds are very red &amp; inflamed
            inside, this will be your signal that they are reheated enough. But
            if you do not see this signal, increase &amp; continue the fire
            until it is the case. If there is nothing in the mold that needs
            burning, it will be enough that they are dried well on the same
            fire, if it is for casting tin. They reheat better in a
            reverberatory furnace. All the molds of flowers are reheated two
            times, first for burning the plants, flowers, and animal parts which
            are left inside. Next, one needs to clean them &amp; remove the
            ashes. Second, reheat them &amp; render them red for casting. At the
            beginning, reheat with some charcoals, gently lit, and put your
            <em>noyau</em> [i.e., plaster] molds flat on the charcoals
            surrounded by bricks (fol. <a
               href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/115v/f/115v/tl"><u>115v</u></a>–<a

    <h3 id="heating-the-mold-and-metal">Heating the Mold and Metal</h3>
    <p>Once the various parts of the mold were cleaned of all ashes and organic
        matter, they were then bound together with wire then “luted” (or,
        “invested”) with a jacket of “founders’ earth,” a mixture of clay, horse
        manure, and hair (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/142v/f/142v/tl"><u>142v</u></a>).
        The parts of the mold were often painted with plaster (fol. <a

    <p>The details of the plant and animal surface textures could only be
        captured if the metal flowed into all of the smallest channels of the
        mold. To achieve this, the author-practitioner recounts much first hand
        experience of casting in tin and lead, metals with low melting points,
        and less frequently in silver and gold, although he provides detailed
        instructions for heating silver and gold on fol. <a

           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/128v/f/128v/tl"><u>v</u></a>.
        He provides very clear, generally consistent directions for alloys: “For
        hollow things like turtles, half fine lead and half tin. For flowers,
        almost all tin, namely a lb of fine tin and two ℥ of fine lead. For
        lizards that are as thick as one or two fingers, almost all lead, namely
        a lb of fine lead and 4 ℥ of fine tin.” (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/150r/f/150r/tl"><u>150r</u></a>).<a

           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref18"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> And, in another example:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Because tin wants to be cast very thinly, if your medal, plant, or
            other thing for molding is thin &amp; fine, do it so that there is
            more tin, much more than lead, namely less than the fourth part lead
            for three parts tin. And still, one puts lead only to form an alloy.
            On the contrary, if you want to mold something strong &amp; thick,
            put a lot more lead in than tin. And in one &amp; the other you can
            put a little looking-glass tin, but only a little, with a little
            rosin, when you want to cast.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>He then adds, “since then, when molding
        with fine and new lead, I put into one lb two ounces of fine tin. And
        when molding with fine tin, I put in two ℥ of fine lead for one lb. I
        made plants &amp; snakes just like nature” (fol. <a

        overheating lead: “I cast tin almost red, and lead the same, which,
        however, had not remained in the fire for too long, for it becomes
        brittle and calcines” (fol. <a

    <p>It appears that heating mold and metal to a high temperature to cast was
        a common practice, as is indicated by the dendritic surface texture of a
        sixteenth-century silver table bell in the British Museum. This shows
        that the molten metal cooled slowly, indicating that this delicate
        object was cast with very hot metal into a mold heated to a very high
        temperature.<a href="#fn22"

    <p>In a long entry on “Repairing cast things,” the author-practitioner
        discusses chiseling off flashing, re-incising lines (e.g., in a turtle’s
        shell), and other elements of repair. In the crayfish entry, he notes,
        “Repair with penknives, files, little <em>chaples</em> [a type of
        chisel], or burins, &amp;c” (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/142r/f/142r/tl"><u>142r</u></a>).
        Delicate elements, such as the horns of the crayfish, that might not
        have cast successfully can be substituted “with whitened latten wire”
        and soldered on (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/141v/f/141v/tl"><u>141v</u></a>).
    </p>
    <p>He also gives instructions for painting the metal casts with oil paint,
        emphasizing the goal of lifelikeness: “To paint it, one does the middle
        of the back <del>mixed</del> with vermilion mixed with a little lake,
        and the sides &amp; the belly &amp; underneath the legs is with a flesh
        color made of vermilion, white of ceruse, a little yellow ocher. As in
        this &amp; all other things, have always the natural one in front of you
        to imitate it” (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/141v/f/141v/tl"><u>141v</u></a>).
        He advises comparing the color of the natural plant with the pigment by
        painting out directly on the leaf or flower:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>For marigold flowers, lightly ground minium for some, &amp; for
            others which are more yellowish, a bit of massicot with it. For
            green, the verdigris has depth &amp; is too dark. If it is a
            yellowish green, you can mix with the verdigris a little yellow
            ocher &amp; stil de grain yellow. If the green is dark, put with it
            charcoal of peach tree pits, which makes a <em>
                <del>v</del>
            </em> greenish black, in the same way that black of ox foot bone
            looks bluish. And thus, by judgment &amp; discretion, put the color
            on the natural flower or leaf to see whether it comes close. But
            layer it transparently, so as not to cover the lines of the work
            (fol. <a
               href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/158v/f/158v/tl"><u>158v</u></a>).
        </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>For painting on metal, he advises an oil
        binder, though, “because oil takes a long time to dry,” if you are in a
        hurry, use “not-too-thick gum” or “color with glair beaten with peelings
        of the fig tree....layer it thinly” (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/129r/f/129r/tl"><u>129r</u></a>).
        Sixteenth-century lifecasts show the use of oil paint (<i><u>Fig.

    <p>The author-practitioner deals with the lifecasting of plants most
        thoroughly on fols. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/117r/f/117r/tl"><u>117r</u></a>
        and <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/145v/f/145v/tl"><u>145v</u></a>–<a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/146r/f/146r/tl"><u>146r</u></a>.
        Two methods are detailed in these entries, both using one-piece molds.
        In one, the plant lies horizontally, fixed into the encircling clay
        walls by its stem, and, in the other, it stands vertically, held up by
        threads. In “A means of molding flowers and plants” (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/117r/f/117r/tl"><u>117r</u></a>),
        the reader is directed to “choose them in their full verdure &amp;
        vivacity, &amp; <del>them mou</del> not pick them, if possible, until
        the time one will want to mold them, so that they do not wilt. Or, if
        you need to carry them from afar, soak their stems in a bottle of water
        or, better still, wine.” The instructions continue with directions to
        reinforce the stem with iron wire, form a wax gate, and two vent
        channels formed with sticks, then to lay the plant halfway down into the
        encircling clay, with the wax gate pressed into the clay. The process is
        clearly illustrated in the marginal sketches (<i><u>Fig. 55</u></i>).<a
           href="#fn25"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref25"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a> The plant is painted with
        eau-de-vie, then the thin plaster “sand” is quickly cast into the mold,
        allowing “two good fingers” thickness of plaster above and below the
        plant. Once the plaster has set, the mold is heated to burn out the
        plant, sticks, and wax gate. Because it is a one-piece mold, it can
        sometimes be difficult to clean the mold entirely of the ashes, and the
        entry “For making the ashes of flowers and plants leave molds” on the
        following page (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/117v/f/117v/tl"><u>117v</u></a>)
        deals with this problem. In “Molding plants and flowers” on fols. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/145v/f/145v/tl"><u>145v</u></a>–<a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/146r/f/146r/tl"><u>146r</u></a>,
        the instructions are repeated in greater detail (<i><u>Fig. 56</u></i>),
        with fuller instructions for wetting the plant with eau-de-vie before
        casting, for the ingredients of the plaster mixture, for removing ashes
        from the mold before casting, for heating the mold before casting
        different alloys (tin-lead, silver, and gold), and for removing the cast
        from the mold (with the point of a knife and a sharp iron wire, or by
        soaking in water), and removing flashing with a penknife. This entry
        also refers to the author-practitioner’s first hand experience: “I have
        molded thus a marigold with its leaves” and “the alloy with which I cast
        a large branch of marigold, which came out neatly like the natural with
        its flower, its buds, and its leaves, was of one lb of fine tin mixed
        with two ounces of lead.”</p>

    <p>Both entries for lifecasting of plants and flowers note that a thread
        passed through the plant and the clay walls can help hold the plant
        firmly in the mold as the plaster is poured in so that the plant is
        neither crushed, nor rises up to the top of the mold with the liquid
        plaster: “When you mold them, if they are not strong enough to hold
        themselves upright, pass a thread through the mold to keep them from
        rising up” (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/145v/f/145v/tl"><u>145v</u></a>).
        This can also be prevented by casting in “the sand little by little,”
        and blowing on the liquid “in order that it settles everywhere,” and
        preventing bubbles in the plaster. During group lifecasting under the
        direction of expert practitioner Andrew Lacy in 2015, art history
        student Sofia Gans used the instructions (with some variations) in fols.

    <h3 id="crayfish-1">Crayfish</h3>
    <p>The entry on the lifecasting of crayfish is an extremely densely written
        section running from fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/141r/f/141r/tl"><u>141r</u></a>
        through <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/142r/f/142r/tl"><u>142r</u></a>.
        The author-practitioner includes much first hand experience in this
        entry, and he views the posing and molding of crayfish as a model for
        beetles, turtles, and crabs, citing the fine points of the crayfish
        techniques extensively in the instructions for other types of animals.
        Like so many of the lifecasting entries, he begins that on crayfish with
        observations that combine natural historical observation with molding
        advice:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>The crayfish is one of the most fanciful to mold, but also provides
            an example for casting many other very difficult things. Males are
            distinguished by the eggs that females carry and by the four <del>
                legs</del> little white leglets at the back that males <em>
                <del>ap</del>
            </em> have inside their tail, after the eight main legs. It is only
            a good thing to dry them out a little, because the lumps only come
            out <del>hard</del> rougher &amp; more beautiful, for everything
            that is of shell does not diminish. It is true that if you let them
            dry too much, these little inside leglets diminish &amp; become more
            slender &amp; do not have as much body. If also they are too dry,
            the flesh separates from the scales. Take heed, therefore, to use
            moderation (fol. <a
               href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/141r/f/141r/tl"><u>141r</u></a>).
        </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>The long entry goes on to provide a
        comprehensive guide to posing, molding, and burning out the crayfish,
        along with tips on how to repair and paint the cast. Missing from this
        account is the actual metal casting, however many other entries treat
        the casting of metals into lifecast molds. Two helpful illustrations
        indicate how to position the crayfish and to create the gates (fols. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/142v/f/142v/tl"><u>142v</u></a>
        and <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/141r/f/141r/tl"><u>141r</u></a>)
        (see figs. 26–27).</p>
    <p>Pamela Smith and Tonny Beentjes deciphered the instructions on fols. <a

                is attached. As noted by the author-practitioner, this method
                should be used especially on a female crayfish with eggs. The
                clay base must be pulled off when forming the second half of the
                mold, and the hard-shelled back of the crayfish withstands this
                better than the eggs and delicate legs on its belly side. ©

    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>Given the lack of experience in
        lifecasting, this trial was fraught with many mistakes, including
        building walls that were too thin (<i><u>Fig. 120</u></i>) and collapsed
        on pouring in the first half of the mold (<i><u>Fig. 121</u></i>). After

    <p>Like the author-practitioner, who apparently made a list of lifecasting
        goals (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/169r/f/169r/tl"><u>169r</u></a>)
        without completing them all (<i><u>Fig. 157</u></i>), the Making and
        Knowing Project also desired to make many more trials of lifecasts of
        plants and insects, after initial experiments with a large leaf cast in
        a two-piece mold (<i><u>Vid. 4</u></i>) and with many insects, including
        butterflies, beetles, grasshoppers, cicadas, and bumblebees.</p>

                lifecasting projects. Some entries are underlined and are
                followed by the word “put” and some by the phrase “put and
                seen.” This could indicate that the author-practitioner has
                entered an account of the process into his manuscript, such in
                the case of “crayfish,” which have a very full treatment in the
                manuscript and are listed as “put and seen.” Other entries, such
                as “bats” and “molding fish,” which are neither underlined nor
                followed by “put” or “seen” do not appear in the manuscript. The
                list is not consistent, however, as “molding in sugar,” for
                example, is treated in the manuscript, but is neither
                underlined, nor “put and seen.” Source: gallica.bnf.fr.

        in and around Toulouse</h2>
    <p>Although extant examples of lifecasting are common in northern Europe,
        French examples are very rare. Louis XIV’s need for bullion in the
        seventeenth century led to a campaign to melt down almost all earlier
        works in silver and gold. An exception was Wenzel Jamnitzer’s large
        basin that survived in the royal collections (<i><u>Fig. 160</u></i>,
        <i><u>Fig. 161</u></i>).</p>

    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>Toulouse was the site of the literary
        contest known as the <em>Jeux Floraux</em> (Floral Games), held since
        1323, at which lifelike gold and silver flowers, including the marigold,
        wild rose, and violet, were awarded to the winners. In the late
        sixteenth century, two Toulouse goldsmiths were responsible for creating
        these flowers: Jérôme Véret in 1576–1582 and 1584–1589, and Arnaud
        Cornayre in 1583. Sources are not explicit about whether these flowers
        were lifecast at this time, but it would appear likely.<a href="#fn29"

    <p>Lifelike lizards cast on bell waists exist in various locales in France
        (<i><u>Fig. 162</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 163</u></i>), although further
        research is needed to determine whether these were cast from life.
        Professor of Art History Pascal Julien discovered nearly a dozen such
        bells in the Landes area of Aquitaine, which all date to the eighteenth
        century.</p>

                    in one day, otherwise the animal begins to smell. Fol. 110r
                    notes that molding from the natural animal will result in a
                    sharper cast than molding from a cast animal: “the best
                    would be to mold in the same day the 4 or 5 molds that you

                    some of the finest impressions were obtained in lead-tin
                    alloys. As she explains (207), foundrymen were “well aware
                    of the properties of various alloys, and specifically chose
                    those which would suit their particular purpose.” This is

                    93–107, who determined that Matteo de’ Pasti chose specific
                    alloys containing arsenic (which adds hardness to lead) and
                    antimony (which expands on cooling thus allowing the capture
                    of fine details) for producing his medals. Ms. Fr. 640, fol.

                    gives one recipe for an antimony-containing additive used by
                    silversmiths, but more consistently (e.g., fol. <a

                    advises the addition of “a bean” of bismuth and a few grains
                    of resin to tin or to a tin-lead mixture to make them flow
                    better on casting. Mark Jones, “Medal-Making in France

                    that medal-making in France was closely tied to Italian
                    techniques and centered in Lyon. Tuttle, “Renaissance
                    Casting Techniques,” 67, notes that “the majority of French
                    medals were made in precious metals,” an observation
                    contrary to the evidence of Ms. Fr. 640.<a href="#fnref20"

                    insects and plants to a shaped slab of wax then casting the
                    whole in metal. Beentjes and Smith experimented with this
                    technique.<a href="#fnref22"
