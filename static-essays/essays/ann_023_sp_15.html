    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>The entry “For making <em>millas</em>”
        (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/20r/f/20r/tl"><u>20r</u></a>)
        describes how to make <em>millas</em>, a type of millet bread, and bake
        it in terracotta molds. Drawing on contemporary and modern sources, we
        undertook a reconstruction of this recipe to investigate the original
        identity of <em>millas</em> in relation to the background of the
        anonymous author of the recipe.</p>
    <h2 id="the-text-and-interpretation-of-the-recipe">The Text and
        Interpretation of the Recipe </h2>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>The recipe, which is written in a
        different hand from most of the rest of Ms. Fr. 640, is clearly
        structured in two paragraphs under the title “For making
        <em>millas</em>.” The first paragraph lists the required ingredients and
        describes how these must be prepared. In the second paragraph, the
        technology needed for the actual baking process is discussed, including
        a specific type of terracotta baking mold.</p>
    <p>The recipe’s primary ingredient is millet grain. The baker is instructed
        to “remove the husks and then [...] clean it well.” Millet is widely
        grown in temperate countries and regions with poor soil, and its seeds
        can be ground to produce coarse flour.<a href="#fn1"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref1"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> The recipe continues, “it is
        necessary to mix the flour with melted fresh butter and milk, and that
        there be as much of one as the other, in such a manner that it is very
        light in color, like the dough to make fritters.” This reference to
        fritters, or beignet pastry, might be a helpful comparative reference
        for contemporary readers or bakers, signaling to them when the
        <em>millas</em> dough was ready for use. For modern readers, further
        research is needed to understand the allusion, as this type of pastry
        has changed in preparation since the sixteenth century.</p>
    <p>Beignet pastry does not appear in the most obvious contemporary source,
        François Pierre de La Varenne’s 1651 <em>Le patissier françois</em>.<a
           href="#fn2"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref2"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> Thus we relied on a modern
        Italian online source that describes how to cook beignet pastry using an
        oven rather than a deep fryer (as is the general modern practice).<a
           href="#fn3"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref3"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> This corresponds to the method
        used in the <em>millas</em> recipe. The writer of the <em>millas</em>
        recipe assumes a reader will already know the appropriate proportions of
        flour, milk, and melted butter. The recipe specifies “two egg yolks [are
        needed] for each <em>millas</em>,” from which the reader is supposed to
        deduce the amount of flour needed. Similarly, saffron is suggested as a
        colorant, but the amount used or depth of dye to be achieved is not
        specified. The reader is assumed to know what the pastry should look and
        feel like before baking.</p>
    <p>In the second paragraph, the recipe provides more detailed instructions
        about the material and shape of the baking mold required. This suggests
        that the writer expected readers to be more familiar with the type of
        bread being made than with the specific shape of the bread and the
        baking technique of the recipe. It calls for “molds, and it is necessary
        that they be earthenware, in the fashion of the crown [<em>fons</em>] of
        a catholic hat, but it is necessary that they be open at both ends.”
        This odd terminology requires some consideration. Excluding symbolic or
        slang meanings, it most likely refers to the shape of certain
        sixteenth-century hats fashionable among Catholic priests. Among these,
        we can identify the <em>zucchetto</em>, the <em>biretta,</em> and the
        <em>Camauro</em>. It is most probable that the last of these is
        intended.<a href="#fn4"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref4"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> The small, hemispherical shape of
        the <em>zucchetto</em> could not contain enough dough if “open at both
        ends.” The square, horned <em>biretta</em> hat would make a creative
        shape for a baking mold, but the recipe explicitly advises to use a mold
        open at both ends, which implies cutting off the horns. A terracotta
        version of a <em>camauro</em> hat, though, would produce a practical
        cylindrical shape, tall enough to contain a certain amount of material
        and with a large bottom [<em>fons</em>] (<i><u>Fig. 1</u></i>), that is
        the “crown,” or the internal area in contact with the head during wear,
        which could easily be filled “with the aforementioned dough” if it were
        open at both ends (<i><u>Fig. 2</u></i>).<a href="#fn5"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref5"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> In addition, since the fifteenth
        century, the <em>Camauro</em> hat was exclusively worn by popes, making
        it “the Catholic hat” most easily recognized at all levels of society (<i><u>Fig. 3</u></i>).</p>

    <p>The baker is directed to keep the mold open on both ends, indicating the
        dough was poured inside the cylindrical mold and placed directly on the
        flour-sprinkled oven surface. The recipe also provides a detailed
        description of the lid used to cover each mold. In the same shape as the
        mold, but larger and closed on the top, the lid allowed the baker to
        place “a little hay [...] and plenty of embers” on the mold, while a
        charcoal fire was set around it.</p>
    <p>Although this analysis of the recipe text and terminology helps in
        visualizing the appearance of the final baked <em>millas</em> and
        clarifies that its finished consistency was probably hard, it is still
        not clear what <em>millas</em> actually was. Millet was, historically,
        an ingredient used in savory dishes. In southern France, as well as in
        Italy, locally available millet or barley was cooked with milk to make
        polenta or bread until maize was introduced to Europe in the sixteenth
        century.<a href="#fn6"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref6"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> Consumption of the new grain
        spread rapidly, especially in southern Europe, and, as it replaced
        millet and barley, maize polenta became a dish consumed by a variety of
        social classes.<a href="#fn7"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref7"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> By the end of the sixteenth
        century, the writer of this recipe could have been aware of maize as an
        alternative,<a href="#fn8"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref8"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> but the eating of millet also
        continued, since some physicians preferred that people stick to familiar
        foods.<a href="#fn9"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref9"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> A contemporary source,
        Bartolommeo Scappi’s <em>Opera</em> (1570), uses millet or “panico” in
        the recipe “Per far la minestra di miglio e panico infranto.”<a
           href="#fn10"

           id="fnref10"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> In this recipe, millet is
        presented as a good grain with a stronger taste than wheat.</p>
    <p>The replacement of millet with maize was also linguistic. In many
        southern European dialects, the word used for the new grain was simply a
        variation of “millet.” For example, in the Occitan dialect spoken in
        Toulouse, where the author-practitioner probably lived, “maize” was
        called “millette.”<a href="#fn11"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref11"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> This raises the possibility that
        the recipe is actually referring to maize, not millet. However, the text
        clearly calls for “<em>millet</em>” not “<em>millette</em>.” While the
        words are similar and confusion is possible, millet rather than maize
        still seems the most likely ingredient. This is reinforced by the
        existence of a modern southern French dish, now made with maize flour
        and sugar, “<em>millas, gateau du Sud-Ouest</em>,” that apparently was
        made by mixing locally available millet flour and water in the sixteenth
        century.<a href="#fn12"

    <h2 id="experiments">Experiments</h2>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>After studying this recipe, we decided to
        experiment with three versions: one using only the ingredients directly
        mentioned in the recipe, and two adding either salt or sugar.<a
           href="#fn13"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref13"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> The addition of one of these two
        ingredients might have been assumed by contemporary cooks. Salt in
        particular might be implied, as in the sixteenth century it was consumed
        by all classes. Sugar is less likely to remain a “silent” ingredient, as
        it (like saffron) was still enough of a luxury to deserve specific
        mention.<a href="#fn14"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref14"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> However, we were curious to
        experiment with the information provided in the modern recipe mentioned
        above and to explore the origins of this French millet flour dessert in
        a sixteenth-century southern French culinary tradition.</p>
    <p>In all our experiments, we used the following basic ingredients and
        instructions, combining the information given in the recipe on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/20r/f/20r/tl"><u>20r</u></a>
        with quantities specified in a modern recipe for beignet pastry: take 3
        cups of flour from ground millet, 2 egg yolks, 3 tablespoons of melted
        butter, 1 cup of milk, a large pinch of saffron, and enough pork lard or
        butter to grease the molds. Pour the flour into a medium bowl, and mix
        it with the egg yolks and the milk. Melt the butter on a low fire, and
        pour it into the center of the flour mixture. Stir the ingredients until
        the dough softens. Add a fair amount of saffron to give color to the
        dough. Grease three molds generously. Place two tablespoons of dough
        into each of the molds and cover with a lid. Place in a preheated 350
        <strong>°</strong> F oven for 30 to 40 minutes, until the dough is
        golden brown.</p>
    <p>Apart from our molds (of which more in a moment), we used the same basic
        cooking equipment for all three experiments. It was clear from our first
        reading of the recipe text that we could not use the hay and charcoal it
        specifies inside our oven due to safety considerations, which naturally
        affected the authenticity of the results.<a href="#fn15"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref15"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> Other equipment was easier to
        incorporate. A traditional ceramic mortar and pestle, for instance, was
        used to grind the millet (<i><u>Fig. 4</u></i>).</p>

    <p>For each version of the reconstruction, the physical challenge of
        grinding a large number of the tiny seeds was surprisingly tiring. The
        ground seeds had to be very fine in order to pass through a cloth sieve
        as described in the text. Several layers of cotton cheesecloth were used
        to extract the finest flour from the ground seeds. This first step of
        the process required focused, time-consuming labor, and the flour thus
        obtained was still characteristically coarse and heavy (<i><u>Fig. 5</u></i>). This step of our recipe reconstruction raised questions about the
        average sixteenth-century French peasant’s use and consumption of grain.

    <p>A few types of mortars are listed among the cooking utensils at the
        beginning of Scappi’s <em>Opera</em>, while just one single mortar is
        included in the kitchen equipment owned by a fifteenth-century French
        peasant discussed by Le Roy Ladurie.<a href="#fn16"

        it very finely. Therefore, we assume that “For making <em>millas</em>”
        has its origins in a rural environment, where the population produced
        and consumed its own product.<a href="#fn17"

        sixteenth-century rural France, the annual quantity of grain produced
        for sale was very low. Most of the grain collected during the seasonal
        harvest was stored in bins by local farmers and consumed within the
        family. It is even more interesting to note that in the early
        seventeenth century, when maize became profitable in the markets of the
        Toulouse region, French peasants were still keeping millet exclusively
        for their own consumption while simultaneously producing maize for
        sale.<a href="#fn18"

    <p>These historical considerations offer us a clue about the rural and
        modest economic context within which <em>millas</em> bread was most
        likely baked and consumed. From this perspective, our experiment with
        adding expensive, luxurious sugar seemed less valid. However, as shown
        later in this essay, the third, sweet version of our baked
        <em>millas</em> actually helped us better understand the phenomenal
        success of maize in the early seventeenth-century grain market.</p>
    <p>Our most puzzling challenge in executing the recipe was reproducing the
        terracotta molds and their lids. Initially we attempted to purchase a
        suitable terracotta item, but it was impossible to find an appropriately
        shaped piece. We therefore decided to buy commercial clay and make our
        own molds, focusing on the reconstruction of the original shape
        according to our interpretation of the author-practitioner’s
        description.<a href="#fn19"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref19"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
    <p>For our first experiment, we made three different molds to test our
        ability in modeling the clay. We made one mold in the shape of a
        <em>Camauro</em> hat open at both ends, foregoing a lid because we did
        not yet clearly understand the text concerning it.<a href="#fn20"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref20"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> The second mold we formed in the
        shape of a small plate with a round lid. The third mold we made in the
        shape of a flower with large open petals. This mold was also baked
        without a lid (<i><u>Fig. 6</u></i>). Once the molds were formed, we
        turned to making the dough. In this experiment, the proportion of
        ingredients we used led to a “light” dough that was probably still too
        dense for our purposes. After we greased the molds well with butter and
        filled them with dough, we put them in the oven. All three versions
        produced a pleasant and appealing aroma during baking.</p>

    <p>Our first <em>millas</em> tasted good at first bite, but a bitter
        aftertaste soon changed our perception (<i><u>Fig. 7</u></i>). We
        surmised that the bitter taste might have been caused by our not having
        soaked the grain before grinding it, since we discovered that according
        to modern nutritional literature soaking millet is an important step. It
        reduces the unpleasant taste, removes phytic acid, and makes it easier
        to digest.<a href="#fn21"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref21"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a> Apparently this practice was
        also known in the early modern period. In Scappi’s treatise, for
        example, most of the recipes that involve the use of any kind of grain
        begin by instructing the reader to soak it in water for “ten hours”
        before mixing in other ingredients.<a href="#fn22"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref22"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a> Reflecting this, in our last two
        experiments, we soaked the millet overnight in a large bowl of water,
        with enough liquid to completely cover the grains. Though the bitter
        aftertaste was diminished, it did not really disappear from our baked
        <em>millas</em>, suggesting one possible reason why in the sixteenth
        century maize swiftly replaced millet for making certain dishes.</p>

    <p>Adapting the instructions in the modern French recipe “<em>millas, gâteau
            du Sud-Ouest</em>,” we made our next two batches of pastry with less
        millet flour but with a large amount of boiled milk: 3 cups milk added
        to the 3 tablespoons of melted butter and 2 cups of ground millet flour.
        We added ¼ cup of salt to the second trial and ¼ cup of sugar to the
        third. The 2 egg yolks were added to the dough once it cooled down,
        before pouring it into the mold and baking it as described above in our
        basic methodology. In both cases, the consistency of the pastry was
        creamier than that of our first experiment (<i><u>Fig. 8</u></i>).</p>

    <p>We decided to use only one of the previous molds. Further reading and
        better understanding of the recipe text supported our choice of a mold
        in the shape of “the crown of a Catholic hat” (presumably a
        <em>Camauro</em>), while a larger lid made of the same red clay and
        closed on the top was constructed and used (<i><u>Fig. 9</u></i>). We
        sprinkled flour on the surface of the oven tray, and placed onto it the
        mold previously greased with butter and open at both ends. We poured a
        small amount of pastry into the mold and used the lid to cover it. After
        baking, both salty and sweet <em>millas</em> came out of the oven golden
        brown (<i><u>Fig. 10</u></i>). The pastry became hard after a bit of
        time, and the end of the recipe notes that the <em>millas</em> should be
        hard. Although over the course of our experiments we doubled the amount
        of saffron from one single small bag or pinch, we did not notice
        significant changes in dough color. Further trials should be done in
        order to establish the necessary amount of saffron.</p>

    <p>The taste of the salty <em>millas</em> resembled common polenta, while
        the sweet version had no flavor beyond a hint of sugar in the first
        bite, suggesting perhaps that the original <em>millas</em> was intended
        to be savory. The addition of the salt to the <em>millas</em> dough did
        not noticeably affect the flavor when compared to that baked strictly
        according to the recipe’s instructions. Thus, the recipe on fol. <a

        may in fact be complete, not necessitating the reader to bring any prior
        experience to it.</p>
    <h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions </h2>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>In addition to our experiments, we also
        focused on the location of “For making <em>millas</em>” within the
        manuscript, since there are no other culinary recipes in Ms. Fr. 640
        concerning millet grain or <em>millas</em>.<a href="#fn23"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref23"

           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/19r/f/19r/tl"><u>19r</u></a>,
        an entry entitled “Clysters” precedes the culinary recipe under
        discussion, while an entry entitled “Glassworker” follows it. These
        three entries from three different fields (medical, culinary, and
        technical) are presented in succession, reflecting the manuscript’s
        sometimes seemingly random ordering of its contents. In these three
        entries, differences in the formulas of the texts reveal something of
        the author-practitioner’s “identity” as an artisan, or as an observer of
        the practices he describes.</p>
    <p>The “Clysters” entry is described from the perspective of an observer,
        using an impersonal “one” (<em>on</em>) to refer to the people actually
        executing this medical technique, though the author-practitioner also
        comments that “it is true that it always causes wind at the end,”
        suggesting he had first-hand knowledge of the technique. In the
        “Glassworker” entry, the author-practitioner is not only knowledgeable
        about the technique of making plate glass, but he is may even have had
        practical experience with it, for he uses specific adjectives to
        describe different types of glass that would not necessarily have been
        known to a casual observer, as in, “glass from Lorraine is smoother
        &amp; more even than plate glass.”</p>
    <p>In the case of “For making <em>millas</em>,” the writer follows a formula
        common to contemporary culinary recipes.<a href="#fn24"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref24"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a> As was normal at the time, the
        recipe does not provide quantitative measurements for its ingredients,
        but it does give clear instructions on technique in the imperative and
        concludes with information about the desired consistency of the baked
        <em>millas</em>.<a href="#fn25"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref25"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a> The author-practitioner was not
        likely employed as a cook, but he was obviously familiar with explaining
        how to perform an unfamiliar process and had probably personally eaten
        the end results of this one.<a href="#fn26"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref26"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a> He probably also had a personal
        connection with <em>millas</em> via the culinary tradition of his
        apparent location in southern France, and he seems to assume the readers
        come from a similar cultural context. For instance, he assumes readers
        will understand references to molds shaped like the crown of the
        Catholic hat and the qualities of the “dough to make fritters.” Because
        this entry is in a different hand from most of the rest of the
        manuscript, we may speculate that the author-practitioner collected this
        recipe, perhaps asking an acquaintance or a scribe to write it in his
        book.<a href="#fn27"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref27"

    <p>In conclusion, our experiments and research gave us the opportunity to
        sensorily and intellectually “taste” <em>millas</em>. Although further
        study is required for a better understanding of the original identity of
        this dish within its traditional culinary context, our initial analysis
        of the recipe text provides clues to the author-practitioner’s
        background, contributing to a better comprehension of the manuscript
        within its historical and cultural contexts.</p>

                <p>According to Laura Mason, sixteenth-century ovens were built
                    of stone or brick. Wood or furze was fired inside and
