        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <div>
            <p>Like blood and gold, salt was a material that brimmed with
                meaning in late medieval and early modern Europe. As a material
                metaphor, salt became a way to think about the innate
                generativity and fertility of nature for authors such as Bernard
                Palissy or Joseph Du Chesne. Yet I show that the analogy between
                human wit and nature’s creative power remained absent from Ms.
                Fr. 640. Here then is the puzzle. If any material in this
                manuscript book of recipes were a material metaphor, surely it
                would be salts. Yet ingenuity does not overtly define the
                manifold roles of salts in Ms. Fr. 640. This striking difference
                with other books of secrets gives us an analytical thread to
                pull. How do we get from the experience of salts, as it surfaces
                in many recipes of the manuscript, to the elaborate ingenuity of
                salt in contemporary authors such as Palissy or Du Chesne? By
                contrasting Ms. Fr. 640 with books of secrets that make more of
                salts, we can probe more finely into how the experience of
                materials relates to textual tradition in shaping this genre.

    <p>Salts in BnF Ms. Fr. 640 pose a puzzle for the history of craft
        knowledge. In early modern Europe, salts included our common table salt
        (NaCl), as well as a family of substances from sal ammoniac (NH<sub>4
        </sub>Cl) to the various nitrates involved in producing saltpeter,
        sharing properties such as volatility, sharp taste, or surprising
        crystallizations. Practitioners of the processes described in Ms. Fr.
        640, such as the Huguenot potter Bernard Palissy and the chymical
        entrepreneur Johann Rudolf Glauber, ascribed enormous powers to salts.<a

           id="fnref1"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> Palissy, for one, held an
        unspecified “salt” to be the generative principle of all things.<a

           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref2"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> By finding in salt nature’s power
        to generate new substances and objects, even new life, thinkers such as
        Palissy put salts and human ingenuity in parallel. To use the hoary
        trope, man’s making imitated Nature’s creating. If Nature’s power to
        create lay in the earthy residues of salt, then salt directly
        corresponded to the human inborn faculty of making knowledge, the
        <em>ingenium</em>.<a href="#fn3"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref3"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> Thus practitioners played on old
        proverbs about salt as wit, just as Benvenuto Cellini, hoping to impress
        King Francis I, embodied his goldsmithing <em>ingegno</em> in a
        saltcellar: his fertile craft paralleled Neptune’s salty power to
        impregnate earthy Venus.<a href="#fn4"

        see, often expanded on salt’s generative powers.</p>
    <p>Here then is the puzzle. If any material were a material metaphor, surely
        it would be salts. Yet ingenuity does not overtly define the manifold
        roles of salts in Ms. Fr. 640. This striking difference with other books
        of secrets gives us an analytical thread to pull. How do we get from the

    <p>Palissy and Cellini are only the most visible peaks in a whole continent
        of writers interested in salt and its meanings. In a range of sources,
        practitioners of distillation, metallurgy, molding, casting, and similar
        skills transformed salt into a central metaphor of nature’s power.</p>
    <p>Matter’s powers to conceive, generate, nurture, and birth complex things
        made it ingenious, in the early modern vocabulary of invention. Perhaps
        the most influential alchemical treatise of the later middle ages was
        the <em>Testamentum</em> (1332), later ascribed to Ramon Llull,
        constructed around the conceit of a dialogue between Nature and an
        alchemical Master.<a href="#fn6"

           id="fnref6"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> The work of the philosophers’
        stone could only be accomplished through their cooperation, “through the

           id="fnref7"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> Before the Romantic restriction
        of genius to individual talent, the language of ingenuity described
        inborn (<em>ingenitum</em>) powers of generation, in a conceptual
        architecture that can be traced across vocabularies of <em>wit</em>,
        <em>esprit</em>, <em>gheest</em>, and so on.<a href="#fn8"

        earth) and described big machines and legal ruses as <em>ingenia</em>.<a

    <p>The step from an ingenious power of generation to salt was small, in such
        works. Salt was already a mysterious product of earth and ocean
        exhalations, Aristotle had taught in the <em>Meteorologia</em> 2.3, a
        residue much like the sediment left by food digested in the body.
        Medieval Islamic authors such as Al-Razi, whose classifications of salts
        became cornerstones of Latin matter theory, encouraged reflection on
        salts within recipes of distillation and transmutation, including within
        the category of salts several different substances: sal ammoniac,
        vitriol, alkali salts, common salt, and others.<a href="#fn12"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref12"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> The underlying capacity for
        crystallizing or condensing substances out of a liquid chaos, or
        liquefying solids, already made “salt” a fundamental principle of matter
        well before Paracelsus crowned it as one of his <em>tria prima</em>,
        along with mercury and sulphur.<a href="#fn13"

        therefore, a diverse family of materials belonged to a grouping we still
        identify as salts.</p>
    <p>Around the time our author-practitioner was gathering his recipes,
        ingenuity was intensifying as a problem for explaining nature. By the
        end of the sixteenth century, many followers of Paracelsus looked to
        salt in particular to explain nature’s generative powers. It was widely
        assumed that nature possessed a kind of ingenuity. Telesio’s <em>De
            rerum natura</em> (1570) went beyond the commonplace that as nature
        reproduced materials, plants, and animals, it worked on analogy to a
        craftsman; he argued that nature in fact displayed intelligence in
        producing things.<a href="#fn14"

           id="fnref14"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> This view can be traced through
        even supposed Aristotelians, such as William Harvey, who explained the

        isolate these animating intelligences, by the late sixteenth century,
        whether as seeds, vital juices, spirits—or as salts. In fact, the idea
        that seeds organize the coagulation of bodies into precious stones or
        metals—an idea with Platonic and Stoic pedigree—overlapped with
        intuitions about how salts acted in dissolving and crystallizing.<a

    <p>The differences between these writers’ views are enormous, but they also
        shared a key substratum of sensory experience, as Rémi Franckowiak has
        argued. All of these were reader-practitioners engaged with furnace and
        distillery, who believed that the way to understanding spirited matter
        is through those techniques that require salts to melt metals, that
        reduce organisms to ashen salts, or prompt new crystals to form. We may
        wonder, then, to what extent are their laboratory experiences the source
        of their distinctive ideas about salts as ingenious materials? Ms. Fr.
        640 offers an intriguing trial.</p>
    <h2 id="ii.-uses-and-sources-in-ms.-fr.-640">II. Uses and Sources in Ms. Fr.
        640</h2>
    <p>Salt permeates Ms. Fr. 640, an index of the diversity of recipes it
        contains. Salt is used for preparing food, to preserve codfish or brined
        artichokes (fols. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/7r/f/7r/tl"><u>7r</u></a>,
        <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/98v/f/98v/tl"><u>98v</u></a>).
        Salts, mixed with a little alum (itself a salt), scrub clean a blackened
        tooth (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/47r/f/47r/tl"><u>47r</u></a>).
        The salt from cabbage ashes is a “remedy against pain” (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/2r/f/2r/tl"><u>2r</u></a>).
        With vinegar, salt helps verdigris turn wood green (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/78r/f/78r/tl"><u>78r</u></a>).
        Salt works as a sand. Heated, washed, then ground with lead, it becomes
        a fine, spherical powder for an hourglass (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/10r/f/10r/tl"><u>10r</u></a>).
        Salt is an abrasive (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/37v/f/37v/tl"><u>37v</u></a>).
        It can be mixed with other rock minerals or burnt bones of oxen and,
        shaken through a sieve, salt is the sand that receives the imprint of a
        model—becoming the matrix for casting (fols. <a

        Salt is the key ingredient in the <em>eau magistra</em> that makes
        casting sand “fatty” and clump to receive a form, and then release it
        (fols. <a

    <p>The author-practitioner of Ms. Fr. 640 distinguishes carefully between
        kinds of salts: common salt; saltpeter; burnt salts; rock salt; sal
        ammoniac. These terms link the author-practitioner to the sources of
        salt in late sixteenth-century France. “Common salt”—of deep nutritional
        and cultural value in premodern European culture—had since the
        thirteenth century been subject to the <em>gabelle</em> or salt tax.<a

           role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a> Our author recognizes the
        variability of “common” salt: it can be rough, or highly refined and
        white (e.g. fols. <a

        He also uses rarer varieties of mined salts: rock salt, or what he
        sometimes calls mineral salt. At one point the author-practitioner
        describes “the salt called <em>de Langlois de armonic</em>” which he
        compares to “that of Cardona and Montserrat,” famous sites in Catalonia
        of mined salt deposits (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/38r/f/38r/tl"><u>38r</u></a>).
    </p>
    <p>The earth and sea were the readiest sources of our artisan-practitioner’s
        salts. Other salts required time and labor to be made ready for
        consumption. He describes the use of saltwort, a plant grown in marshes
        along the Atlantic coast of France—burning it yielded a salty ash alkali
        strong enough to use in making glass (fols. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/36v/f/36v/tl"><u>36v</u></a>,
        <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/68r/f/68r/tl"><u>68r</u></a>).
        Saltpeter, a common ingredient, could be found in two varieties, natural
        (scraped from precipitates on cave walls) and artificial. Since the
        author of Ms. Fr. 640 never specifies, he likely would have intended the
        more common artificial saltpeter, widely known in early modern Europe as
        an expensive constituent of gunpowder, expensively and laboriously
        refined from heaps of earth containing urine and excrement.<a
           href="#fn23"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref23"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a> Tartar was a commonly found
        byproduct of winemaking, scraped from the insides of used wine barrels;
        in turn, it was calcined and refined into salt of tartar. Likewise sal
        ammoniac, which occurs in forty-one recipes of Ms. Fr. 640, came in
        natural and artificial varieties; it was widely advertised as the
        product of far off places, dug from under the sands of Africa, but our
        author is more likely to have found it as an import from “the East,”
        produced by sublimating the soot of burnt camel dung.<a href="#fn24"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref24"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a> Indeed, this old recipe may
        explain why the author-practitioner advised adding a little rose honey,
        clove oil, and cinnamon to improve the “bad odor” of sal ammoniac
        applied to the teeth (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/47r/f/47r/tl"><u>47r</u></a>).<a

    <p>The genre of recipes reinforces the variety and singularity of these
        salts in the manuscript. Most of the time, their uses do not overlap
        and—apart the semantic field of <em>sel</em>—the author-practitioner
        gives no overarching theory to bind them together. The fact that salt
        turns sand “greasy,” “fatty,” or acts as a <em>mater</em> or “magistra”
        in structuring molds does suggest a generative power, perhaps. After
        all, in these cases salt becomes the special something that makes
        everything else hold together or take on form. But the recipes rely on
        these powers without thematizing them in a way that allows us to think
        the artisan-practitioner intended to foreground those meanings. In fact,
        a recipe might specify mixing specific amounts of common salt, sal
        ammoniac, and saltpeter, a specificity of use that suggests the
        author-practitioner easily recognizes the difference between these
        substances. Only at one place does the author-practitioner substitute
        one salt for another: “And on all of this, put in a <em>gros</em>
        <del><sup>pour ℥</sup></del> of <em>sel de verre</em>; &amp; some &amp;
        the common people put in <em>
            <del>e</del>
        </em> sandiver that they find at the glassmakers' or apothecaries'. But
        alkali salt, as you know, is better. ” (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/100v/f/100v/tl"><u>100v</u></a>).
        We would recognize sel de verre as a version of alkali salt; the
        author-practitioner, however, seems to distinguish them on the basis of
        origin; what was called alkali salt was usually purified from ash, such
        as from burnt saltwort. Even when he asserts a near-equivalence of
        substances, the emphasis is on subtle distinctions of quality—“alkali
        salt, as you know, is better.” These examples show the
        author-practitioner keen to distinguish salts by both source and use,
        not running them together in the wondrous web we find in the theoretical
        literature of his contemporaries.

    <p>Can Ms. Fr. 640 help us see the web of meanings spun around salt? Several
        essays in this Edition sketch the shape of our uncertainty about what
        the author intended with the recipes.<a href="#fn26"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref26"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a> It is hard to decide
        definitively whether it is a workshop record, a personal documentation
        of trials, notes towards a published book of secrets, or something
        entirely different. It seems fairly certain, however, that the
        manuscript is not fully dressed up to go out in public. It does not
        perform all the meanings, therefore, embedded within it.</p>
    <p>The well-known case of Benvenuto Cellini helps us begin to tease apart
        the layers of genre and meanings, seeing how recipes might gain these
        meanings. Salt features in his book of recipes, and is thematized in the
        saltcellar he famously presented to Francis I. In his own recipes,
        published as the <em>Due trattati</em>, Cellini uses salt, sal ammoniac,
        tartar, and salpeter as fluxes for soldering, in metal and glass
        polishes and varnishes, in pigment binders, and for making aqua fortis
        (nitric acid) to dissolve gold.<a href="#fn27"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref27"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a> But in Cellini’s recipes a
        theory of salt is never at the surface. Instead, it is the saltcellar
        that unlocks our view of how Cellini saw salt, as the material analogue
        of his own fertile wit. In his careful reading of the object, Michael
        Cole has shown how acutely sensitive Cellini was to the broader
        resonance of salt as a metaphor of the goldsmith’s ingenuity.<a
           href="#fn28"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref28"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a> Cellini’s reclining Land and Sea
        personified the crafty struggle implicit in Aristotelian saline
        chemistry, in which earth and water artfully produce a composite of
        burnt and wet earth; his poetry and the object itself represent salt as
        an emblem of human power to decompose and recombine gold, glass, and
        color. Cellini made Francis I the saltcellar for many reasons; but all
        of them are bound up around the conceit of the artisan’s
        <em>ingegno</em> for creating <em>con sale</em>.</p>
    <p>A restrained praxeology is just what we might expect from recipes. In
        fact, Cellini’s <em>Trattati</em> and Ms. Fr. 640 treated salts in
        almost identical terms as those found in medieval collections of
        recipes. The <em>De diversis artibus</em> of Theophilus Presbyter
        deploys salts in corroding copper to make “salt green,” or in water for
        tempering steel, or—most frequently—as a flux in molten silver and
        gold.<a href="#fn29"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref29"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a> The enormously successful book
        of secrets by Alessio Piemontese concentrated its references to salts in
        its sixth book, on precisely the topics of metalwork in which salts
        appear in Ms. Fr. 640.<a href="#fn30"

        <em>segreti</em>, salts were omnipresent but not verbose.</p>
    <p>Nevertheless, sixteenth-century printed books of secrets developed into
        much more than simple protocols of technique. The unique selling point
        of Cellini’s <em>Trattati</em> was not particularly subtle: his recipes
        often lapsed into self-aggrandizing tales of how he had delighted the
        French king and other noble patrons, which illuminate little of how he
        thought about salt. To find a larger audience, many such books offered
        entertaining observations or the wonder of curious explanations.<a

    <p>Other editorial strategies supplied salt with additional meanings.
        Giovanni Battista della Porta mentioned salts hundreds of times, often
        with the same uses we would expect from Ms. Fr. 640: food preservation,
        tempering steel, and counterfeiting precious stones. These uses in fact
        require different salts, but the text runs together different uses. A
        group of novel uses connect salts with fertility. Certain plants,
        ancient writers had already reported, thrive when watered with salt
        water—coleworts, sweet betony, and even date-trees. In fact, salt
        directly aids fertility, since “keepers of sheep, and goats, and Mares,
        do besmear their hands with&nbsp;salt&nbsp;and nitre, and then rub the
        generative parts of them in the time of their coition, for their more
        lustful and eager performance of that action.”<a href="#fn32"

           id="fnref32"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a> Offering aids for human
        conception, he noted that “Salt also helpeth Generation: for it doth not
        only heighten the Pleasures of&nbsp;Venus,&nbsp;but also causeth
        Fruitfulness. The Egyptians, when their Dogs are backward in Copulation,
        make them more eager by giving them Salt-meats. It is an Argument also
        of it, That Ships in the Sea, as&nbsp;Plutarch&nbsp;witnesseth, are

        anecdotes available to a curious Neapolitan nobleman supported the idea
        that salt fertilized.</p>
    <p>When pressed, writers of books of secrets adopted explanatory frameworks
        to connect salt’s myriad uses. Della Porta gives over fifty references
        to salts in Book 10, “Of Distillation.” Here those he calls “the
        Paracelsians” are a starting point, because of their interest in the
        extraction of essences, which della Porta stresses is “a very difficult
        work; for they may be either Oyl, or&nbsp;Salt, or Water.”<a
           href="#fn34"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref34"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a> A comparable framework is found
        in Vannoccio Biringuccio’s metallurgical manual, <em>Pirotechnia</em>
        (1540), which took its starting point from Pliny’s long natural history
        of salt. After surveying the usual methods of extracting common salt by
        evaporation, Biringuccio presented some sources of saltpeter, sal
        ammoniac, rock salt, and sal alkali, some “natural” and most
        “artificial”—none of his descriptions are detailed enough to reproduce,
        but they nevertheless struggle to enunciate a common origin of all these
        salts. He summed up the chapter with a theoretical claim about the
        qualities shared by this diverse range of salts: “I am sure that salt
        can be extracted from anything that has a biting sharpness and that is
        converted into ashes by fire.”<a href="#fn35"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref35"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>35</sup></a> Such accounts reasoned from
        analogies between artisanal processes for producing salts, culled partly
        from contacts, rumors, and ancient sources such as Pliny, which were
        then filtered through a fundamentally Aristotelian chemistry of salt as
        a product of water, earth, and fire. Thus, after della Porta and
        Birunguccio, printed books of secrets increasingly presented the idea
        that not only did salts serve generative and transformational process,
        but were themselves transformed out of water and earth by fire.</p>
    <p>Within this new wave of printed books of secrets, one of the most
        elaborate accounts of salt is found in Hugh Plat’s <em>Jewell House of
            Art and Nature</em> (1594).<a href="#fn36"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref36"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>36</sup></a> The book shares more with the
        works of Della Porta and Alexis Piedmontese (whoever he was) than with
        Biringuccio; it collects household recipes for food and health, and
        devotes books to distillation, molding, and casting metals. The most
        unusual addition was its entire second book, titled “Diverse new sorts
        of Soyle not yet brought into any publique use, for manuring both of
        pasture and arable ground, with sundrie concepted practices belonging
        therunto.” This new “sort of soyle” was lime, called <em>marne</em> (or
        <em>marl</em>). Plat chiefly drew on Bernard Palissy, who had explained
        salt as the fifth element, reasoning from the common experience of how
        salt crystallized within the processes common in distillation, molding,
        and casting: salts come from evaporated seawater, putrefied matter, the
        lees of wine, and the burning of plants grown in water.<a href="#fn37"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref37"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>37</sup></a> Palissy had also added an entire
        book on a certain earth which was whitish, salty, and had the power to
        regenerate sterile soil. In <em>The Jewell House</em>, Plat did more
        than translate Palissy’s ideas. He connected these two parts of Palissy:
        he explained the source of marl’s generative power through its saline
        chemistry. Even though salt often served to decompose matter, it could
        also regenerate. The prophet Elisha had restored a bad well and
        unfruitful land with a bowl of salt (2 Kings 2).<a href="#fn38"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref38"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>38</sup></a> “Neither is there any place in
        the whole world,” Plat pointed out, “where that generative vertue doth
        more abound, or where there is infinit generation and multiplication of
        creatures, then in the wide Ocean. And I doo verely beleeve yt the
        spirit of God which in the beginning did spread itself upon the waters
        (which I doe hold to be certen fire) did make them to be of that nature,
        that is to say, thicke and salt, and by that reason they are much more
        apt for the generation of all creatures, then any fresh waters

           role="doc-noteref"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
    <p>Plat identified Palissy as his source of the idea that is the common
        agent behind all the varieties of salt—but he also found Palissy too
        bookish. Palissy “telleth us of the exceeding fertillity, that is found
        in salt waters, by that infinite generation and multiplication of
        fishes, yea of Venus her selfe, that <em>Primum mobile</em>, in the
        procreation of children, and the other of those pleasant grapes, growing
        in the salt Marishes of Xantoigne [Saintonges].”<a href="#fn40"

           id="fnref40"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>40</sup></a> Yet this was not sufficiently
        down to earth for Plat. He finds Palissy too hesitant in distinguishing
        this salty principle (“vegetative salt”) from the diversity of real,
        physical minerals. Instead, he lumps Palissy in with the philosophers,
        claiming his own knowledge is much more practical, gleaned from
        experience itself. He reported one who “of his owne mother witte sowed a
        bushell of salte long since upon a smal patche of barren grounde at
        Clapham which to this daye remayneth more fresh and green.” This salty
        success confirmed his own experience:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>“And for my part, I must here acknowledge that the best naturall
            phylosophie that ever I coulde learne in this point, was neither out

            <em>Garsceus</em> meteors, nor out of any of the old philosophicall
            Fathers, that writ so many hundred yeares past; but that little

    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>As a result, Plat proceeded to advise
        spreading one’s soil not only with marl, but also with baysalt and
        brine.</p>
    <p>Such advice may well be the product of Plat’s own experience. To be sure,
        too much common salt will render most soil toxic for most plants. Yet in
        smaller quantities, common salt was known as a fertilizer. Theophrastus,
        Aristotle’s student, had noted this use, and natural philosophers bent

        Valerius Cordus, and other books of secrets. His vernacular epistemology
        of salt was hybrid all the way down, a cornucopia of the tangled sources
        driving the genre of secrets.</p>
    <h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
    <p>Like blood and gold, salt was a material that brimmed with meaning in
        late medieval and early modern Europe.<a href="#fn44"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref44"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>44</sup></a> A rich example of where the
        generativity of salt might lead from earthy experience to heavenly
        insight is an unpublished early treatise of the young shoemaker Jakob
        Boehme. The <em>Aurora</em> offered a heady mixture of alchemy, natural
        philosophy, and apocalyptic theology.<a href="#fn45"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref45"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>45</sup></a> Boehme distinguished two forms
        of a primordial salt principle, <em>Salitter</em>, in which one form is
        dark, smelly, and earthy and the other form is pure, clear, and filled
        with heavenly power. This corresponded to the experience of saltniter,
        first a product of manure and then refined as a flash-filled crystal.<a
           href="#fn46"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref46"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>46</sup></a> The prime responsibility of
        salitter is celestial generation.<a href="#fn47"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref47"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>47</sup></a> For Boehme, a kind of divine
        materialist, salitter was literally the stuff of ingenuity. Salitter
        provided the divine matter, the sharpness, heat, vitality, and indeed
        the intelligence with which every human, indeed every natural body, is
        made. As a material, salt could become a way to think about the innate
        generativity and fertility of nature.</p>
    <p>Yet I have suggested that the analogy between human wit and nature’s
        creative power remained absent from Ms. Fr. 640. This illustrates one of
        the most striking features of this manuscript for the modern historian:
        that despite the books it lists, and despite the richness of its
        collection, it aims mostly at practice. This is not news. Perhaps more
        surprising is what comparing Ms. Fr. 640 with the tradition of printed
        books of secrets says about the genre as a whole. The laconic nature of
        recipes has often encouraged historians to oppose them to books of
        natural philosophy. Historians of recipes have often pointed out that
        even printed collections codify practice, not theory.<a href="#fn48"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref48"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>48</sup></a> Books of secrets therefore seem
        to represent for some historians a backlash against the bookish
        traditions, a revolt of the crafts against elite <em>scientia</em>. This
        appears true if we compare the restrained case of Ms. Fr. 640 only with
        the more highly worked philosophical works by Joseph Du Chesne or Blaise
        de Vigenère, where salty metaphors of ingenuity crystallize. But,
        comparing these against a range of recipe books, a study of salt
        suggests these are only the poles of a continuum. As Elaine Leong has
        observed, recipe books in manuscript were valued precisely because they
        were manageable, while in print they accrued new agendas that
        proliferated out of control.<a href="#fn49"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref49"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>49</sup></a> Printed recipes were more
        swiftly laced with explanations. With Hugh Plat, we can see such
        explanations redeploying the arguments of other recipe books. Rather
        than finding recipes opposed to bookish theories, the case of salt shows
        how arguments for practice, once they left the workshop, themselves
        quickly became intertextual. On the first folio, <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/1r/f/1r/tl"><u>recto</u></a>,
        of Ms. Fr. 640 there is a long list of authors, from ancients such as
        Strabo and Alexander of Aphrodisias to moderns such as Polydore Vergil
        and Bernard Palissy. If the author-practitioner planned to use this
        reading list to work up his recipes for publication, perhaps—we are left
        to speculate—at that stage he might have assembled his particular salts
        into a universal salty principle. At any rate, this was what his peers
        did.</p>

                    The sexual metaphors are heavily overdetermined: they come

                    sexual metaphors to describe change and generation; and the
                    language of ingenuity is deeply inflected by the
