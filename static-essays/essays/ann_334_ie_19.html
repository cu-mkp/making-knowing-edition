        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <div>
            <p>Each semester, the Making and Knowing Project invited an Expert
                Maker to spend two weeks with the Craft and Science course in
                order to introduce students to necessary skills for their lab
                work. Silversmith and conservator, Tonny Beentjes (Head of the
                Metals Conservation Programme, University of Amsterdam) joined
                the Project in Fall 2014. He led the students in sand molding in
                frames, following Ms. Fr. 640, fol. <a
                   href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/118v/f/118v/tl"><u>118v</u></a>.
                The students then took their molds to be cast in the Ubaldo
                Vitali Studio. In this essay, Tonny discusses his experience as
                an Expert Maker and the need to find a <em>via media</em>
                between his training in contemporary practices and the pursuit
                of historical reconstructions with novice students.</p>

    <p>In the fall of 2014, when the Making and Knowing Project was
        investigating the moldmaking and metalworking entries in BnF Ms. Fr.
        640, I had the honor to be the first expert maker with the Project, and
        I focused with students on the entries for making sand molds and casting
        metals into them (<i><u>Fig. 1</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 2</u></i>, and <i><u>Fig. 3</u></i>). The author-practitioner of Ms. Fr. 640 devoted
        about a third of the manuscript to the art of casting, and the sections
        on casting from life actually first sparked interest in the
        manuscript.<a href="#fn1"

    <p>The author-practitioner uses the term “frame” (<em>chassis</em>) molding.
        Ms. Fr. 640 is especially interesting for its numerous entries
        describing the making and use of refractory powders for molding. The
        author-practitioner also mentions the use of natural sand (or, earth),
        giving detailed descriptions of the location this sand can be found in
        the hills near Toulouse (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/87r/f/87r/tl"><u>87r</u></a>–<a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/87v/f/87v/tl"><u>87v</u></a>).
        The molds in the manuscript can roughly be divided into two groups based
        on their composition: the first uses plaster of Paris to make a liquid
        mold material, and the second uses fine powders or “sand”
        (<em>sable</em>) that is compacted in a frame around the model or
        pattern. The former is comparable to lost wax casting and was used to
        cast intricately shaped objects, especially objects from nature for
        lifecasting. The latter, in contrast, was used for casting less
        intricate objects without undercuts, such as medals, and was the focus
        of the fall 2014 session.</p>
    <p>Casting in a sand mold requires a model or a pattern to be impressed into
        a mold (see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TL919mY28fk"><u>Vid.
                1</u></a>). Unlike lost wax and casting from life, the pattern
        is not lost in the process and it can be used repeatedly. For frame or
        sand molding, the model needs to be sturdy enough to have the sand
        packed tightly against so that it makes a detailed impression. Some of
        the students made their own model first in wax and then, because the wax
        was too soft and sticky for a good sand impression, they reproduced this
        wax model subsequently in sturdier plasters (<i><u>Fig. 4</u></i>,
        <i><u>Fig. 5</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 6</u></i>, and <i><u>Fig. 7</u></i>).<a href="#fn2"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref2"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> The next step was to prepare the
        frame mold. The entry on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/118v/f/118v/tl"><u>118v</u></a>
        describes the use of remnants of old molds, made up from plaster and
        brick dust, which had to be crushed into powder. Fortunately, parts of
        molds from previous Ms. Fr. 640 lifecasting experiments were available.
        We crushed these old molds in mortars and sieved them, a quite messy and
        laborious activity (<i><u>Fig. 8</u></i>).</p>

    <p>Then the real molding could commence: the recipe stipulated the use of
        water with sal ammoniac (ammonium chloride) to moisten the dry powdered
        sand (<i><u>Fig. 9</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 10</u></i>, and <i><u>Fig. 11</u></i>).<a href="#fn3"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref3"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> Moistening the sand was the
        pivotal moment in the reconstruction experiment: the sand had to be
        moistened to a specific consistency, and the information in the recipe
        was not sufficient for a person without previous sand molding experience
        to know how to proceed further. The expert maker could intervene in the
        process, but this will also mean that he influences the interpretation
        and course of action. An expert maker is a practitioner usually trained
        in twentieth- or twenty-first-century practices, and, although these
        practices can sometimes be very similar to historical working methods,
        one has to be very careful not to impose modern efficient modes of
        working and thinking on historical practices. Centuries of
        experimentation and modern scientific research have resulted in
        generally accepted standardized practices of mold design and casting
        methods, particularly in foundry processes.</p>

    <p>Previous reconstructions using Ms. Fr. 640 demonstrated that some of the
        practices described in the recipes contradicted these modern views on
        best working practices.<a href="#fn4"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref4"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> The combination of a novice
        working with an expert or master is therefore a very interesting and
        useful approach to use in historical reconstructions, often providing a
        learning opportunity for both parties. The knowledge and skill gains of
        the novice are quite obvious, but the expert can also learn a great deal
        from the interaction with the novice. This is especially the case when
        the novice interprets the historical text first and makes independent
        observations and reflections, not hampered by previous “modern”
        knowledge of the subject. In addition to this, an inquisitive novice
        can, through effective questioning, force the “master” to rethink
        established practices and produce new insights into historical working
        methods.</p>
    <p>The Fall 2014 workshop on frame molding revealed to me new and valuable
        insights into the consistency of molding sand. Throughout the manuscript
        the author-practitioner emphasizes the fact that powders used for the
        mold should be ground as finely as possible to achieve a good cast. My
        initial thought was that this aim for minimum grain size was entirely
        driven by the empirical thought according to which the finer the grains,
        the finer the imprint on the mold. However, I realized during this
        workshop that there are other factors at play. For example, the fineness
        of the powder also has an effect on the consistency of the molding sand,
        on the way it can be manipulated and compressed, and on the impression
        it makes on removal of the model. This has to do with the way water
        disperses between the sand grains: as the grain gets finer, the cohesion
        improves, especially when the grain size is lower than 0.2 microns and
        takes on clay-like properties. This realization occurred to me when,
        because of time constraints, we made molds using powdered molds that
        were quite coarsely grained (<i><u>Fig.12</u></i>, <i>
            <u>Fig.13</u></i>). Indeed, when it came to handling and
        finding the right moisture level, these molds reacted in a distinctly
        different way from the very fine material with which I had worked
        before. During my expert maker residency in fall 2014 I was working on
        my doctoral research into the sand mold casting technique, and working
        with the recipes from Ms. Fr. 640 contributed greatly to my
        understanding of the fundamentals of sand molding.</p>
