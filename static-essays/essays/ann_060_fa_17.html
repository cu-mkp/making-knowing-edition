        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <div>
            <p>Throughout Ms. Fr. 640, the author-practitioner uses
                <em>azur</em> to refer to blue pigments. It is not clear if this
                means <em>azur</em> in a general sense of “blue color” or as a
                reference to specific pigments. Analyzing historical uses of the
                term <em>azur</em> can give insight into the linguistic and
                artistic landscape in which the author-practitioner operated.
                The four most likely pigments to which <em>azur</em> could refer
                are azurite, lapis lazuli, smalt, and verditer (synthetic
                azurite). In tabulating textual occurrences of <em>azur</em> to
                isolate patterns of use, <em>azur</em>, <em>azur desmail</em>,
                <em>cendres dazur</em>, and <em>azur dacre</em> emerge as
                significant. Through reconstruction of entries involving
                <em>azur</em> (fol. <a
                   href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/11r/f/11r/tl"><u>11r</u></a>),
                we found qualitative data to support a tentative historical
                identification of <em>cendres dazur</em> with verditer. Although
                <em>azur desmail</em> would seem to denote smalt, we as yet lack
                experimental justification for this conclusion. The
                reconstructions carried out for this essay demonstrate the
                complexity of blue pigment making and application during the
                Renaissance, and allow us to draw very tentative conclusions as
                to the identity of some of the manuscript’s terms for blue
                pigments.</p>

    <h2 id="azur-in-ms.-fr.-640"><em>Azur</em> in Ms. Fr. 640</h2>
    <p>In twenty-two entries in Ms. Fr. 640, the author-practitioner uses the
        term <em>azur</em> when discussing blue pigments. <em>Azur</em> refers
        to the color blue in French, but also is connected to the French term
        for azurite, a specific material used as a blue pigment mainly composed
        of copper carbonate, isolated from a naturally occurring ore. The
        author-practitioner may simply mean azurite when he uses <em>azur</em>,
        but he could also mean other contemporary materials. The
        author-practitioner had access to a variety of other blues in
        sixteenth-century Toulouse, including verditer (a synthetic copper
        carbonate), lapis lazuli (a mineral from Afghanistan) and smalt (crushed
        blue glass).<a href="#fn1"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref1"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> Fortunately, the author-
        practitioner sometimes qualifies <em>azur</em> with additional language:
        <em>azur desmail</em>, <em>esmail dazur</em>, <em>vert dazur</em>,
        <em>azur vray</em> and <em>cendres dazur</em>, among others. Analyzing
        these qualifications can help us better understand the physical meaning
        of <em>azur</em> in the manuscript.</p>
    <p>At the outset, we do not know whether the author-practitioner
        distinguishes pigments (e.g., <em>cendres dazur</em> referring to
        verditer and <em>azur vray</em> referring to lapis lazuli) or merely
        different grades of the same pigment resulting from different states of
        grinding or washing in a process known as levigation, which separates
        different-sized particles.<a href="#fn2"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref2"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> Randle Cotgrave defined “azur” or
        “asur” as “azure; skie-colour, or, the stuffe wherof tis made.” Among
        those “stuffes,” he lists “Asur d’Acre. <em>Naturall Azure, as it is
            taken out of the Mine</em>,” and “Asur d’Alemaigne; Germane Azure;
        <em>is an exhalation of silver Mines; from the tops and sides of whose
            stones it is choicely scraped, and gathered</em>.” He further
        defines “Asur de Levant” and “Asur d’outre mer,” as “Beyond-sea Azure;
        <em>the best kind of Azure, made of</em> Lapis Lazuli, <em>and resisting
            both fire and water</em>”; while “Cendrée d’asur” is “<em>The
            whitest kind of Azure</em>,” and “Vert asur” is “<em>A colour
            betweene a blonket, and a greene; found in mines of the copper which
            is mingled with silver; and an excellent purger of
            melancholie</em>.”<a href="#fn3"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref3"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> While such historical sources as
        Cotgrave’s dictionary can give us an idea of how people distinguished
        blues in the sixteenth century, we cannot know through terminological
        analysis alone whether the author-practitioner used the language in the
        same way as his contemporaries.</p>
    <p>The qualitative nature of the author-practitioner’s observations hinders
        us from judging definitively how they correspond to different materials.
        For instance, the author-practitioner frequently speaks of colors
        “dying.” What does this term mean? Our natural assumption is that blue
        “dies” when it becomes a lighter shade of blue. Modern physical and
        spectral analysis gives us a quantitatively defined “ideal blue,” but
        this modern conception of blue almost certainly differs from the
        author-practitioner’s due to our exposure to synthetic and digital blues
        as well as to our spectral understanding of color. For the
        author-practitioner, as we discuss below, lapis lazuli most likely
        represented the “ideal blue,” used in the most expensive and high
        quality paintings on canvas, panel, or parchment. Reconstructions of the
        <em>azur</em> entries can give us a better idea of what pigments the
        author-practitioner might be referring to, as they can test, or at least
        provide clues about, the various qualitative properties of pigments that
        the author-practitioner describes. Neither of these
        approaches—historical or experimental—nor a combination of the two can,
        however, answer this question definitively.</p>
    <p>This essay has three parts. First, a historical linguistic investigation
        of <em>azur</em> as a term helps give context for common usage during
        the sixteenth century, although the author-practitioner may have adopted
        an idiosyncratic, personal usage of <em>azur</em>. The possibility that
        he derived recipes from other sources complicates any assumption we can
        make about the consistent use of terminology across the various recipes.
        We will therefore investigate whether the experimental evidence proves
        irreconcilable with common usage by reconstructing the manuscript
        entries involving <em>azur</em> with the four most likely blue pigments
        (azurite, verditer, lapis lazuli and smalt). As a basis for this
        experimentation, we must conduct a second stage of linguistic research,
        in which we analyze the <em>azur</em> entries in the manuscript to
        identify patterns in the author-practitioner’s language (i.e., to
        isolate <em>azur</em> from <em>azur desmail</em> and from <em>cendres
            dazur</em>). We can then identify points in the reconstruction
        process at which a pigment should behave as the author-practitioner
        notes, for example, that <em>cendres dazur</em> dies in oil (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/11r/f/11r/tl"><u>11r</u></a>).
        This reconstruction of some of the <em>azur</em> entries forms the third
        section of this essay. Once we complete these three lines of inquiry, we
        can then attempt to discern what patterns govern the relationship of
        <em>azur</em> and specific pigments throughout the manuscript. We can
        get a sense of how the author-practitioner uses <em>azur</em>, but we
        will never be able to achieve enough data to adequately demonstrate a
        1:1 correspondence between terms and materials. Through this
        investigation, the ambiguous nature of blue in sixteenth-century artwork
        becomes clear. From reconstructing the <em>azur</em> entries, which
        typically mention blue in the context of painting, we get a sense of the
        high level of skill that sixteenth-century painting required. As the
        author-practitioner does not seem to have been a professional painter,
        our difficulty in preparing usable paints and then successfully painting
        them out perhaps sheds light on his own difficulties; hence, this may
        provide evidence that he experimented with various techniques.</p>
    <p>From the investigation outlined below, we can tentatively conclude that
        <em>cendres dazur</em> corresponds to verditer and that <em>azur
            vray</em> corresponds to azurite. Although research on
        <em>esmail</em> suggests that <em>azur desmail</em> denotes smalt,
        experimental inquiry has so far yielded no persuasive evidence in the
        lab for this conclusion.</p>
    <h2 id="azur-in-the-sixteenth-century"><em>Azur</em> in the Sixteenth
        Century</h2>
    <p>Modern terminology has been standardized in reference to blue and blue
        pigments; sixteenth-century makers and artists had a very different
        understanding. In modern nomenclature, azurite is <em>azurite</em> in
        French, <em>Azurit</em> in German, <em>azzurrite</em> in Italian, and
        <em>azzurro</em> in Spanish.<a href="#fn4"

        through a process called levigation. Should we not know if a blue
        pigment actually comes from azurite, we have a multitude of scientific
        processes which can give us the answer: microchemical tests, emission
        spectrographic analysis, X-ray diffraction analysis, visual
        spectrophotometry, neutron activation analysis, and others.<a

        appreciate the potential ambiguity the multiple terms pose to
        historians: both smalt and azurite had names associated with Germany,
        for instance. All the same, we should not forget the strong prestige of
        lapis lazuli in particular. Material certainly mattered when people knew
        what they were working with.</p>
    <p>In medieval Europe, artists chose between ultramarine/lapis lazuli (used
        in the finest manuscripts) and azurite (a cheaper, but still deeply-hued
        substitute).<a href="#fn13"

        apart when purchasing, some medieval artists or merchants used a test

    <p>It seems unlikely that the author-practitioner used lapis lazuli for the
        entries we are considering because he does not use any of the language
        typically associated with the rare Afghan blue, nor does he describe its
        production process. Thus azurite, smalt, or verditer seem the most
        likely candidates. Though we have discussed azurite and smalt, verditer
        requires explanation. By the end of the medieval period, synthetic
        copper carbonate blues—verditer—frequently appeared in artwork.<a

        could be synthesized, but also could be “formed by natural precipitation
        from flowing water from a copper mine, or on tailings.”<a href="#fn33"

    <p>The author-practitioner discusses these three blue pigments—azurite,
        smalt, and verditer—on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/11r/f/11r/tl"><u>11r</u></a>
        in the entry on “Painting <em>esmail d’azur</em> in oil.” He begins by
        discussing what appears to be azurite, referring to its need for
        levigation (to separate it from malachite and other impurities):</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>The main thing is to grind it well on marble, and before that, to
            have washed it thoroughly. Some grind it <del>with</del> thoroughly
            with an egg yolk &amp; then wash it in five or six waters and lay it
            on not with a paintbrush, which would be too soft, but with a brush
            thoroughly softened &amp; crimped, &amp; layering it thickly as if
            one were putting it down with a trowel; settling down it evens out
            and flattens. I have experienced that grinding <em>azur
                d’esmail</em> with egg yolk &amp; next washing it in several
            waters is good. However, it loses a little of its vividness in the
            grinding of it.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>Then he seems to turn to smalt
        (manufactured from glass and cobalt from German mines): “Those who make
        it in Germany compound it like enamel, in large pieces which they
        pestle, &amp; pass through several sieves &amp; wash.” Finally, he notes
        the synthesis of blue pigment carried out either in an alembic in a
        workshop or through channelling and settling runoff water from copper
        and silver mines:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>To make azures beautiful, they wash or soak them in a rock water, as
            they call it; it is a water distilled from mines where azure or
            <em>vert d’azur</em> is found, which distills naturally through the
            veins of the mountain or is distilled through an alembic <em>
                <del>par</del>
            </em> from mineral stones of azure or copper.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>This last passage apparently refers to the
        creation of copper carbonates as a byproduct of silver and copper
        mining. For example, a particular type of malachite of spherical
        particle form was manufactured in the area around Neusohl (now Banská
        Bystrica) where the Fugger-owned copper and silver mines of Herrengrund
        (now Spania Dolina), Sandberg (Piesky), and Altgebirg (Staré Hory) were
        located and which formed the main sources of azurite and malachite,
        often referred to as “Hungarian,” in this period. In <em>De Natura
            Fossilium</em> (1546), Georgius Agricola (1494–1555) described how,
        around Neusohl in the Carpathian Mountains, this water was channelled
        through tubs. The water deposited what Agricola called
        “<em>chrysocolla</em>” in the tubs, which was scraped off once a year
        and sold as a pigment referred to as <em>Schifergrün</em>,
        <em>Berggrün</em>, or mountain green (<i><u>Fig. 3</u></i>).<a

        eighteenth-century archival documents for pigment factories include

    <p>Although the author-practitioner’s understanding of blue pigments cannot
        be known with certainty from passages such as that on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/11r/f/11r/tl"><u>11r</u></a>,
        we can gain a sense of the period understanding of “ideal” blues through
        examining Renaissance works of art. The finest blue most often went to
        the robes of the Virgin Mary, a fact corroborated in scientific analysis
        of some Renaissance paintings; in Filippino Lippi’s <em>The Virgin and
            Child with Saint John,</em> the artists used azurite paint for the
        sky and lapis lazuli for the Virgin’s robes.<a href="#fn37"

    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>From the table above, we can see that the
        author-practitioner qualifies azur in the following ways (from most to
        least common usage): <em>azur desmail</em> (18); <em>azur</em>
        (unmodified) (17); <em>esmail dazur</em> (4); <em>cendres dazur</em>
        (3); <em>azur dacre</em> (2); <em>assiette dazur</em> (1); <em>azur la

        (1); <em>subtil de lazur</em> (1); <em>vermeillon azur</em> (1);
        <em>vert dazur</em> (1); and <em>vieulx azur</em> (1). Of these, we will
        focus on terms appearing more than once, which can best help us
        interpret a pattern of usage. These are <em>azur desmail</em>,
        <em>azur</em>, <em>esmail dazur</em>, <em>cendres dazur</em> and
        <em>azur d’acre</em>. <em>Azur desmail</em> and <em>esmail dazur</em>
        seem related to enamel in terms of language, which perhaps suggests
        smalt.<a href="#fn40"

    <p>The research essay by Amy Chang, “What is <em>Esmail</em> in Ms. Fr.
        640?,” suggests that a twenty-first century readership needs to
        understand sixteenth-century enamel in order to appreciate the

           role="doc-noteref"><sup>45</sup></a> Ana Matisse Donefer-Hickie’s
        research on glasswork provides insight into the author-practitioner’s
        meaning. She notes that sixteenth-century writers categorized “glass”
        into two categories, <em>cristallin</em> and <em>émail</em>.
        <em>Cristallin</em> was clear and expensive, whereas <em>émail</em> was
        opaque and of lower quality.<a href="#fn46"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref46"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>46</sup></a> In considering the text of Ms.
        Fr. 640, we cannot discern a clear relationship between <em>azur
            desmail</em> and <em>esmail dazur</em>. Fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/11r/f/11r/tl"><u>11r</u></a>
        begins with <em>esmail dazur</em> in its title but proceeds to use
        <em>azur desmail</em> in all subsequent mentions of (presumably) the
        same substance. This usage implies that the author-practitioner used the
        terms interchangeably. <em>Esmail dazur</em> in a later entry, on fol
        38r, seems to suggest a substance used in creating imitation gems.
        Considering Donefer-Hickie’s claim that <em>émail</em> was used in
        making glass beads, the author-practitioner’s use of <em>esmail
            dazur</em> for gem-making further supports its identification with
        glass, and therefore with smalt. The context tells us that one can melt
        <em>esmail dazur</em>, suggesting that <em>esmail dazur</em> might refer
        to the lump form rather than the powder. This deduction is speculative,
        as one could also melt an already ground pigment.</p>
    <p>Of the four most common <em>azur</em> terms, it seems that the
        author-practitioner systematically distinguishes <em>azur desmail</em>
        (possibly including <em>esmail dazur</em>), <em>cendres dazur</em> and
        possibly <em>azur d’acre</em>. In half the instances of <em>azur</em>,
        however, we only have an unqualified <em>azur</em> or a uniquely
        occurring term like <em>azur vray</em>. We can see, then, that
        <em>azur</em> blue constituted an ambiguous and broad category for the
        author-practitioner—while he certainly distinguished <em>azur
            desmail</em> as something specific, and probably distinguished
        <em>cendres dazur</em>, we cannot determine if <em>azur</em> refers to
        anything particular about material identity from his language alone.
        This idiosyncrasy suggests one of three things: that the
        author-practitioner simply referred to blue as a category, with little
        attention to specific materials; that the author-practitioner felt
        readers would easily understand what blue pigment he intended based on
        immediate context; or that the author-practitioner consistently
        identified one pigment with unqualified <em>azur</em> (e.g., possibly
        azurite) and only specified <em>cendres dazur</em> and <em>azur
            desmail</em> when he wished to indicate the use of other blue
        pigments. We must also entertain a final possibility: given that the
        manuscript may include entries copied from other sources, the
        author-practitioner may not use <em>azur</em> and its corresponding
        terms with any consistency.</p>
    <h2 id="experimental-methodology">Experimental Methodology</h2>
    <p>At several points, the author-practitioner acknowledges the difficulty of
        working with blue pigments, stating that, while “lake &amp; lead white
        &amp; ceruse are easy to work in oil,”</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>every kind of azure is difficult. And to make beautiful azure, one
            needs to layer it not with large strokes of the paintbrush but with
            small strokes of the point. Not only ash &amp; <em>azur d’Acre</em>
            but mainly <em>azur d’esmail</em> which one needs to choose to be
            very delicate, <del>for it</del> otherwise you will not <em>
                <del>v</del>
            </em> be able to work with it except with much work, and even then
            you need to allay it with turpentine to give it body (fol. <a
               href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/59r/f/59r/tl"><u>59r</u></a>).
        </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>Of “<em>azur d’esmail</em>,” he says that
        it “hates more than any other to be ground, especially with water, for
        it dies &amp; loses all its color. However, because it cannot be worked
        if it is coarse, grind not with water but with oil &amp; grind it
        thickly, and in this way it will not die as much” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/58v/f/58v/tl"><u>58v</u></a>).
        And, in order to work with “<em>esmail d’azur</em>” in oil, he relates
        on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/11r/f/11r/tl"><u>11r</u></a>
        “a secret that is hardly known to common painters,” saying that</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Some take the most delicate they can &amp; grind it with ceruse,
            which binds it, and next prick with an awl in several places the
            area they want to paint with <em>azur d’esmail</em>, in order that
            the oil enters &amp; leaks in, &amp; does not cause the azure, which
            in itself is heavy, to run. Others lay the panel flat &amp; put down
            the azure on it, which is also done in distemper.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>To respond to the difficult handling of
        this pigment, however, one can also</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>lay it on not with a paintbrush, which would be too soft, but with a
            brush thoroughly softened &amp; crimped, &amp; layering it thickly
            as if one were putting it down with a trowel; settling down it evens
            out and flattens (fol. 11r).</p>

    <p>The idea of a pigment “dying” was not unique to the author-practitioner.
        Conservation scientist Marika Spring suggests that it refers to a
        process whereby the pigment particles sink to the bottom of the oil
        medium after the paint has been applied, leaving a skin of oil on top
        which impacts the pigment’s vivacity.<a href="#fn49"

    <blockquote>
        <p>The death of colors is when the oil floating on top dries and forms a
            skin which blackens with the air. There are some colors—enamels
            [<em>esmaulx</em>], among others—that do not easily mix with oil,
            but always go to the bottom without binding, and thus die and
            blacken easily.</p>

    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>This explanation from Mayerne places the

        to “prick with an awl… in order that the oil enters &amp; leaks in”
        instead of forming a blackened layer of surplus oil.</p>
    <p>Among the many statements made by the author-practitioner about the
        properties and behavior of different blues, we chose three on which to
        perform experiments. These particular statements seemed possible to test
        relatively easily, and by this means we thought we might be able to
        differentiate the various blues to which he refers. The first experiment
        reconstructed blue paints from pigments bound in aqueous media and oil
        to compare change in color between the two; the author-practitioner
        suggested that <em>cendres dazur</em> in oil should “die,” or lose
        color, whereas <em>azur vray</em> should keep it (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/11r/f/11r/tl"><u>11r</u></a>).
        The second experiment reconstructed a separation method in which we
        immersed prepared oil paint in water to see if the pigment would
        separate from the binding medium; the author-practitioner suggested that
        <em>azur desmail</em> should separate from its binding medium (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/59r/f/59r/tl"><u>59r</u></a>).
        The third experiment reconstructed a test of pigment quality in which we
        added pigment to lead white; the author-practitioner suggested that high
        quality <em>azur desmail</em> should turn the lead white
        <em>turquine</em> whereas low quality should turn it lavender-gray (fol.
        <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/93v/f/93v/tl"><u>93v</u></a>).<a

    <h2 id="experiment-1-azur-vray-vs.-cendres-dazur">Experiment 1: <em>azur
            vray</em> vs. <em>cendres dazur</em></h2>
    <p>To attempt to understand the identity of <em>azur vray</em> and
        <em>cendres dazur</em> described on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/11r/f/11r/tl"><u>11r</u></a>,
        we considered the following text and devised an experimental test to
        investigate it: “azure ashes are only good for landscapes because they
        die in oil. Only true azure holds on” (fol. 11r). The
        author-practitioner provides qualitative properties for “azure ash”
        here—that it should die (i.e., lose color) in oil, whereas “true azure”
        should maintain its color. Through preparing the four pigments under
        consideration in both aqueous and oil media and subsequently analyzing
        color change, we can procure evidence for the identification of “azure
        ashes” and “true azure.”</p>
    <p>We prepared lapis lazuli, two grades of azurite, verditer, and smalt in
        walnut oil and glair. All pigments were purchased pre-ground from
        Kremer.<a href="#fn51"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref51"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>51</sup></a> In our reconstruction, we varied
        the pigments and binding media and attempted to keep all other variables
        constant. In preparing paints, there are several variables we can
        control to compare our paints effectively: mass/volume ratios,
        viscosity, or final color. As final color is our dependent variable, we
        considered varying viscosity (i.e., the ease with which paint adheres to
        the brush and releases onto the substrate) and the mass/volume ratio
        (i.e., the ratio of binding media to pigment). Of these two variables,
        it seemed the mass/volume ratio would be easier to keep constant.
        Despite this, the experiment was done twice, using mass/volume first and
        viscosity in the second iteration (<i><u>Fig. 4</u></i>).</p>

        three grams of binding medium. In the viscosity controlled paints, we
        added indeterminate amounts of binding media (always exceeding three
        grams) to achieve proper viscosity for painting. To isolate the pigments
        in small containers against a white background, we used white plastic

    <p>I attempted to compare the color of the prepared paints with my naked eye
        and using photography corrected for white balance using the GIMP GNU
        Manipulation Program; this program translated the color of the paints
        into RGB values, thus representing the intensity of red, green, and blue
        light reflected by each surface respectively on a scale of 0 (none) to
        255 (greatest intensity). Using the GIMP GNU Manipulation Program, the
        average value of a 3-pixel radius circle in the center of each well was
        taken and tabulated. Based on the data, it seems that azurite suffered
        the least change—starting dark and ending slightly darker—when bound in
        an oil medium rather than glair. Verditer, by contrast, shows the change
        more clearly both to the naked eye and under RGB-value analysis, going
        from a bright blue to a dark blue in oil while darkening substantially
        less in glair. Might azurite be the “true azure” while <em>cendres
            dazur</em> refer to verditer? As discussed above, verditer served as
        a synthetic substitute for azurite in the sixteenth century and
        typically appears in lower quality works than does azurite.<a

        us little about lapis lazuli and smalt, which each show only a slight

        azurite and verditer by <em>azur vray</em> and <em>cendres dazur</em>.
    </p>
    <p>While I had initially planned to assess the color change of the pigments
        in oil and glair by applying the paints I prepared to various supports
        (e.g., paper, canvas, panel), additional variables introduced by the
        painting process itself complicated this and thus prevented me from
        drawing any firm conclusions.<a href="#fn57"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref57"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>57</sup></a> Nevertheless, other insights
        emerged: whereas painting in oil proved intuitive and somewhat forgiving
        (one can apply paint onto a support and spread it around without it
        drying), glair posed several difficulties. Early attempts at painting in
        glair resulted in lumpy and uneven surfaces of paint. At the advice of
        Jo Kirby, we practiced painting first with modern watercolors and later
        with reproduction sixteenth-century paints. In accordance with her
        advice, we deduced that small strokes, quickly applied and in multiple
        coats, best achieve a deep, even color. The labor and precision required
        surprised us, revealing that painting even a uniform surface requires
        skill.</p>
    <h2 id="experiment-2-azur-desmail-immersion">Experiment 2: <em>azur
            desmail</em> immersion</h2>
    <p>On folio 59r, the author-practitioner writes that “Azur d’esmail tempered
        in oil, leaves it &amp; returns to its primary nature if you mix it in
        water” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/59r/f/59r/tl"><u>59r</u></a>).
        This prescription seems fairly straightforward; a prepared paint of
        <em>azur desmail</em>, once immersed in water, should separate back into
        oil and <em>azur desmail</em> powder. An alternate reading, however,
        might relate “primary nature” to color change. To test this observation,
        we prepared paint in walnut oil from azurite, lapis lazuli, smalt and
        verditer (using pigments from Kremer). We then placed this paint into
        the bottom of beakers, which we then filled quickly with water. We did
        this immediately, without allowing the pigments to dry. After letting
        them sit for several days, however, we did not see that the pigment had
        separated fully from the oil, though some oil had collected on top of
        the water.<a href="#fn58"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref58"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>58</sup></a> It seems that we either
        misinterpreted what “returns to its primary nature” means or that we
        should have added the paint to the water rather than vice versa. To
        determine anything further from this experiment, we would need to do
        more tests.</p>

            canvas, where it is imbibed immediately, than on wood. Varnish
            returns it to its vigor, because being imbibed, it becomes dark. To

        turquoise. While these properties suggest that the verditer might
        correspond to the “beautiful” turquine pigment, it seems
        counterintuitive as verditer was a cheaper substitute for the “real”

        it potentially suffers from confounding variables. First, the

        same pigment, rather than between different pigments. Second, we used
        too great a proportion of lead-white paint to pigment due to
        underestimating lead-white’s strong masking ability. We should also note
        that <em>couleur turquine</em>, according to Randle Cotgrave’s 1611

    <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>By investigating <em>azur</em> in Ms. Fr. 640, we can get a sense of
        sixteenth-century artists’ and makers’ often ambiguous use of “blue” as
        a category for colors and pigments. Historical research suggests that
        <em>cendres azur</em> likely corresponds to verditer or lower-grade
        azurite or lapis, and <em>azur desmail</em> likely corresponds to smalt.
        We can tentatively speculate that unqualified <em>azur</em> refers to
        azurite. From historical investigation of <em>azur</em> in the sixteenth
        century, textual analysis of <em>azur</em> in the manuscript and
        reconstructions of a few of the <em>azur</em> entries, we can
        tentatively identify <em>cendres dazur</em> with verditer and
        <em>azur</em> with azurite. Historical and textual analysis suggest that
        <em>azur desmail</em> corresponds to smalt, but we yet lack any
        experimental findings to support such a conclusion.</p>
    <p>The experience of attempting to reconstruct sixteenth-century blue paints
        and then of actually painting them out in a uniform fashion reveals the
        difficulty of using the evidence of experimental reconstruction in
        assessing historical documents and linguistic usage. Despite my
        expectation that modern materials and technical methods of analysis
        would help distinguish between the different materials, it became clear
        that the most important factor may actually have been my own lack of
        expertise in painting. Because I was learning as I went, and I did not
        have time to achieve skillful application of egg-based or oil-based
        paints, I could not draw definitive conclusions. Just as significant, we
        do not know the author-practitioner’s own level of painterly skill, his
        knowledge of the terms for <em>azur</em>, his familiarity with any of
        the pigments in question, nor whether he had firsthand experience using
        them. In sum, then, the author-practitioner’s different terms for blues
        on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/11r/f/11r/tl"><u>11r</u></a>
        must remain obscure. Avenues for further research include the
        author-practitioner’s interest in different blues, the mention of
        painters bringing their palettes to grocers, and the apparent
        familiarity that the author-practitioner has with the making of
        synthetic blues in his discussion of making blues from “rock water.” If
        the author-practitioner was indeed familiar with making verditer, it
        would shed light on his discussion of <em>azur</em> throughout the
        manuscript.</p>

                <p>Azurite (2CuCO<sub>3</sub>.Cu(OH)<sub>2</sub>) commonly
                    decomposes to form malachite (CuCO<sub>3</sub>.Cu(OH)<sub>2</sub>), a similar basic copper carbonate, although it can
                    also form other copper chloride isomers, including
                    atacamite, paratacamite, and clinoatacamite. See E. Mattei,
                    G. de Vivo, A. De Santis, C. Gaetani, C. Pelosi and U.
                    Santamaria, “Raman spectroscopic analysis of azurite

                    (2008): 302–306, here 302. Azurite is less stable under
                    atmospheric pressure than malachite, which can be seen in
                    the many pseudomorphs of malachite that occur after azurite.
                    Thus equilibrium partial pressures can be calculated with
                    data from Gibbs free energy for the transition of azurite
                    into malachite, as has been done by B. W. Vink. “Stability
                    relations of malachite and azurite,” <em>Mineralogical
                        Magazine</em> 50 (March 1986): 41–47. For applications
