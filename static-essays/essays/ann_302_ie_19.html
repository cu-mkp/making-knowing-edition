    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
    <p>The body and embodied sensory experience have long been the subject of
        historical inquiry. In the history of art and science, bodily knowledge
        of gestures and materials has come to the forefront, particularly in
        studies of artisanal ways of knowing. To early modern artists and
        artisans, the encounter with and understanding of the material world was
        a distinctly physical and sensory one, resulting in a kind of knowledge
        that was intimately linked to the body and hard to put into words.<a
           href="#fn1"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref1"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> In the history of medicine,
        understandings and experiences of the body have been reconstructed from
        both sides of the medical encounter. Following the impulse of Barbara
        Duden’s questions about the construction of the modern body, scholars
        have shown how physicians and, more importantly, patients, understood
        bodies in terms of inspection, palpation, auscultation, and “fluxes”
        felt within the body.<a href="#fn2"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref2"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> Although focusing on the same
        object—the body and bodily sensation as both object and tool of
        knowledge-making—approaches from the history of craft knowledge and the
        history of medicine have tended to remain within their respective areas
        of scholarship.</p>
    <p>BnF Ms. Fr. 640 represents a rare opportunity to bring questions about
        embodied knowledge and about the body in health and disease into
        conversation with one another. While even scholastic physicians clearly
        used their senses to assess diseases and remedies, few early modern
        sources describe sensory experience in such detail as the
        author-practitioner does. From the sound of the local bell named
        <em>Cardaillac</em>, which Toulousains claimed was the most beautiful in
        all of France (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/20v/f/20v/tl"><u>20v</u></a>),
        to the scratchy feeling of walking in “boots of hay” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/54v/f/54v/tl"><u>54v</u></a>)
        to the “pain of g[out]” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/7v/f/7v/tl"><u>7v</u></a>)
        or the smell of bread freshly drawn from the oven, where they are to be
        replaced with the drying bodies of animals (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/130r/f/130r/tl"><u>130r</u></a>),
        the quotidian and material-focused perspectives of the manuscript
        readily provide a rich imaginary of sensory perception.<a href="#fn3"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref3"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> Furthermore, in the context of
        complex technical processes, the author-practitioner explicitly
        discusses the body and senses as epistemic tools.</p>
    <p>I focus on the non-visual senses, partly for the sake of brevity, partly
        because the visual is usually given much more attention than the other
        senses, and partly because the latter can be said to have a clearer
        physical component and thus provide a more fertile ground for exploring
        <em>embodied</em> sensation.<a href="#fn4"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref4"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> Based on references to touch,
        taste, smell, and hearing in the manuscript, I explore what we might
        call the author-practitioner’s “material sensorium”—the set of sensory
        tools and how they resulted in knowledge and expertise of materials and
        processes. I then show how these interactions between body and materials
        change the body not only in terms of accrued embodied knowledge but also
        with respect to the fabric of the body and the practitioner’s health.
        Finally, I argue that the interaction cuts both ways: touch and
        exhalations may harm materials and affect processes just as the human
        body may be harmed by them. While this essay is an initial exploration
        and not a definitive assessment, it brings together key examples of the
        author-practitioner’s sense of the senses and opens up questions about
        the relationship between the body and the workshop.</p>
    <h2 id="touch">Touch</h2>
    <p>Unsurprisingly for someone who clearly worked with his hands a lot,
        touching plays an important and intriguing part in the
        author-practitioner’s practice and writing. Touching something is
        perhaps the most direct way to experience it, but while the tactile
        experience is highly immediate, it can also be fooled. Stick a coin to
        your forehead with saliva. Tell your friend that you will do the same to
        them, and challenge them to shake it off without using their hands.
        Instead, palm the coin and plant your well-licked thumb on your friend’s
        forehead, <em>et voilà</em>: “thinking he has the piece on his forehead
        due to the coolness of the saliva, he will shake his ears &amp; will get
        nowhere” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/33v/f/33v/tl"><u>33v</u></a>).
        Just like the sense of sight, that of touch can easily be misled by
        sleight-of-hand tricks, and all the more convincingly for the immediacy
        of the experience.</p>
    <p>To the well-trained touch of a craftsman, especially one who melted and
        cast metal, this immediacy could be immensely useful. In the absence of
        reliable objective means of measuring temperature, the subjective
        experience of touch was a ready guide. The water used to wet a
        particular kind of molding sand “should be of such heat that you cannot
        hold your finger there without feeling strong heat” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/137v/f/137v/tl"><u>137v</u></a>).<a
           href="#fn5"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref5"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> The temperature of the mold
        itself, too, was crucial, to ensure that it would not cause the molten
        metal to bubble or prematurely congeal during the cast. In an entry on
        casting tin, for example, the author-practitioner notes that the mold
        should only be moderately hot, “such that you can hold it in your hand”
        (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/115v/f/115v/tl"><u>115v</u></a>),
        whereas in another, on casting lead and tin, he writes that “your mold
        must not be cold, but of such a heat that you can handle it without
        harm, or that you can keep your finger in the gate without burning
        yourself” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/131v/f/131v/tl"><u>131v</u></a>).
        While bodies were different, and the well-callused finger of a seasoned
        metalworker surely embodied a different sense of what constituted a
        bearable temperature, the author-practitioner relied on the sense of
        touch as a guide to fairly specific temperature ranges such as the
        “lukewarm heat” required for a mold into which lead and tin is cast
        (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/116v/f/116v/tl"><u>116v</u></a>).
    </p>
    <p>In choosing and preparing the right sand for making molds for casting—one
        of the author-practitioner’s preoccupations—another aspect of touch
        comes into play: its ability to detect subtle differences in
        consistency. “Mineral sand,” for example, should “break apart between
        your hands &amp; have very small &amp; delicate grains &amp; of the same
        nature” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/88v/f/88v/tl"><u>88v</u></a>).
        Such fine, homogeneous sands could be achieved by artifice, but, as the
        author-practitioner points out, many artisans prefer their sand ready
        made by nature herself. In that case, one should</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>seek the one of the mine, which is not too fatty, the one that is a
            kin of earth, not too lean &amp; consequently without bond, but
            rather that which is pulled from the depths of the sand-bed in
            bricks &amp; clods that show its natural compaction, which is quite
            difficult to break &amp; which has a very small &amp; delicate
            grain, &amp; which is found soft when handling it between the
            fingers. (fol. <a
               href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/90r/f/90r/tl"><u>90r</u></a>)
        </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>The success of a detailed cast relied to a
        great extent on such specifics of particle size and bond of the sand,
        and the sense of touch was instrumental in assessing these and
        communicating them to others in writing.</p>
    <p>The author-practitioner uses the very limits of haptic sensation as just
        such a material indicator. Another sand for casting is made with “the
        bone of oxen feet, thoroughly burned &amp; pulverized &amp; ground on
        porphyry, until it is not felt between your fingers” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/84v/f/84v/tl"><u>84v</u></a>).
        Here, the reader is told to stop grinding not when they can feel a
        particular sensation but when they can no longer feel the material at
        all with their fingers. As it turns out, this criterion of eluding the
        sense of touch was an important technical concept for early modern
        artisans. Postdoc Jenny Boulboullé and students Raymond Carlson and
        Jordan Katz have shown that the term <em>impalpable</em>, that is to say
        “un-feelable” or “impalpable,” is central to the way the
        author-practitioner experiences and thinks about different kinds of
        materials used for casting molds. Furthermore, they found that he is not
        the only one: the use of the term “impalpable” is used in published
        works on metallurgy, such as the well-known book <em>De la
            pirotechnia</em> (1540), by the sixteenth-century Italian founder
        and metallurgist Vannoccio Biringuccio (ca. 1480–ca. 1539), and <em>De’
            secreti</em> (1555), a famous book of secrets by Alessio Piemontese,
        likely a pseudonym of polymath Girolamo Ruscelli (1518–1566). In his
        emphasis on the haptic sensation of a material being impalpable, then,
        the author-practitioner speaks to a sensory terminology widely shared by
        expert makers.</p>
    <h2 id="taste-and-smell">Taste and Smell</h2>
    <p>While touching could yield important information about structures and
        surfaces, materials’ more intrinsic, internal properties were more
        amenable to tasting and smelling. To make sal ammoniac water of the
        correct concentration, the author-practitioner notes that “the size of
        two chestnuts of pulverized sal ammoniac suffices in a pot of water,”
        but since such measurements could vary, he adds, “to the tongue, you
        find the water moderately salty, for too much is not good” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/111v/f/111v/tl"><u>111v</u></a>).
        While “moderately salty” is perhaps just as contingent as “two
        chestnuts” and “a pot,” the author-practitioner clearly thought it a
        useful indication of what should be aimed for.</p>
    <p>Perhaps more usually, the sense of taste was used in judgments of quality
        rather than quantity. Early modern Toulouse was a centre of the woad
        trade, so it is not surprising that the author-practitioner should
        record local expertise in the thorough assessment of the prized
        dyestuff: “The goodness of the pastel woad is known when, put in the
        mouth, it gives a taste as of vinegar” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/39r/f/39r/tl"><u>39r</u></a>).
        This was just one part of the rigorous assessment, which also involved
        detailed visual examination and a dyeing test, but it is striking that a
        quick bite of a fermented woad ball was seen as a definite clue to its
        quality.<a href="#fn6"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref6"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
    <p>It also points to another aspect of the author-practitioner’s sensorium:
        the use of material referents to describe sensation. He clearly assumes
        the taste of vinegar to be so widely familiar as to give most readers a
        good idea of what they should look for in a woad cake. Similarly, Emma
        Le Pouésard suggests in her essay that bread functions as a common
        material referent in Ms. Fr. 640, providing widely intelligible points
        of comparison for texture, consistency, and oven temperature.<a
           href="#fn7"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref7"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> Although the author-practitioner
        occasionally includes more specialist referents, such as “the smell of
        tin” that identifies a certain type of mercury, these comparisons
        suggest an effort to make the sensory experience of his workshop
        available in his writing by drawing on a shared material sensorium of
        everyday life in an early modern city (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/92v/f/92v/tl"><u>92v</u></a>).
    </p>
    <p>In addition to the artisan’s sense of taste, that of the buyer also had
        to be taken into account. Kitchen pots should be made in such as way as
        “not to give a bad taste to the food,” and while some producers were
        tempted to “mix in more latten to make them yellower, to make them more
        vendable,” the author-practitioner warns that “the latten by itself,
        &amp; at a mere touch, is stinking &amp; of bad odor” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/36v/f/36v/tl"><u>36v</u></a>).
    </p>
    <p>Here taste and smell overlap in their off-putting effect, but smell also
        stands on its own as a sensory tool in the manuscript. A strong smell
        was often a sign that things had gone wrong, as in the case of the
        malodorous kitchen pots, or, for example, when papier-mâché had been
        left to soak for too long and had turned rotten (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/81r/f/81r/tl"><u>81r</u></a>).
        However, smells could also help identify the materials needed for a
        recipe. The ingredient list for another alloy, for example, includes the
        intriguingly specific “congealed mercury with the smell of tin” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/92v/f/92v/tl"><u>92v</u></a>).
        A material’s smell could also give clues as to its properties and likely
        behavior in a given process. Returning to his favourite topic, the
        making and use of different casting sands, the author-practitioner notes
        that “white sand smells like sulfur when reheated, and I believe it
        would melt. And since the substance has been cast in it, it acquires in
        the mold a luster as if it were leaded or vitrified. I believe that
        glassmakers could use it” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/99r/f/99r/tl"><u>99r</u></a>).
        In addition to his observation of a vitreous glaze on the cast object,
        it is the sulfurous smell which suggests to the author-practitioner that
        this particular kind of sand is prone to melt and could even be used for
        making glass. This is particularly interesting in the light of sulfur’s
        frequent appearance in the manuscript as a material that can be easily
        melted and used to cast small objects, and even as a sort of material
        metonymy for transformation and experimentation.<a href="#fn8"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref8"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
    <h2 id="hearing">Hearing</h2>
    <p>The sense of hearing becomes itself the subject of a short entry. Under
        the heading “Hearing from afar,” the author-practitioner records another
        miscellaneous trick for daily life which are scattered here and there
        throughout the manuscript: “make a small hole in the earth, &amp; place
        your ear fully there, at night or at a silent time, &amp; you will
        easily hear the noise” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/125r/f/125r/tl"><u>125r</u></a>).
        In addition to such playful uses of hearing, specific noises could serve
        as helpful indicators in the workshop. Before casting metal into a mold
        made from cuttlefish bone, the author-practitioner writes, one has to
        make sure that it is completely dry: “you will recognize that they are
        dry enough when, after having brought the inside &amp; the imprint of
        these to the fire, they cry &amp; crackle once brought near the ear”
        (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/145r/f/145r/tl"><u>145r</u></a>).
        If one was prepared to listen carefully, the materials themselves could
        tell when they were ready to be worked upon. A similar notion emerges in
        Paracelsus’s (1493/4–1541) more explicitly articulated approach to
        embodied and sensory knowledge of the material world. In his
        philosophical apologia of experience as a powerful and legitimate way of
        knowing, he claims that rather than studying texts, it would be more
        profitable to “overhear” what nature herself had to say.<a href="#fn9"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref9"

    <h2 id="burns-fumes-and-toad-piss-sensory-experience-and-the-body">Burns,
        Fumes, and Toad Piss: Sensory Experience and the Body</h2>
    <p>Sensory experience does not leave the body unchanged. It is clear that
        the author-practitioner, through repeated touching, tasting, and
        listening, acquired a nuanced and sensitive material sensorium,
        calibrated to make fine-grained distinctions. It is also clear, however,
        that the sensory experience of the workshop could affect the artisan’s
        body in a distinctly negative manner.</p>
    <p>Working with high heat and using one’s finger to feel temperatures by
        touch carried obvious risks, as is attested by an entry titled “Against
        burn,” recommending crushed onions soaked in verjus, or black soap
        applied to the wound (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/20v/f/20v/tl"><u>20v</u></a>).
        A much longer entry—“Against burns, excellent”—gives a detailed and
        fascinating description of how to make a burn salve, including holy
        water and the recitation of prayers. To underline the efficacy of the
        remedy, the author-practitioner concludes, “a gunpowder maker, who had
        almost completely burnt himself &amp; showed no sign of the burn, taught
        me this” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/103r/f/103r/tl"><u>103r</u></a>).
        Touching things thus resulted not only in haptic knowledge of materials
        but also in expertise in dealing with the negative effects of that
        direct contact on the body.</p>
    <p>Lifecasting animals brought with it not only the dangers of metalwork but
        also those of catching and killing the creatures in the first place.
        Toads, lizards, and snakes were popular as lifecast objects due to their
        symbolic association with nature’s cycles of putrefaction and
        generation, but the very attributes which likely earned them this
        reputation could be a challenge for the artisan. Speaking of toads, the
        author-practitioner writes: “if by chance you want to mold this vile
        animal, &amp; if it were to piss in your hand, it would burn your hand
        &amp; itch, as if you had handled nettles. But the most powerful remedy
        for this is to put your hand into fresh earth &amp; to cover it as if
        you wanted to bury it” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/109v/f/109v/tl"><u>109v</u></a>).
        Snakes, on the other hand, could bite if not caught with great care, and
        the author-practitioner describes the precautions he observed from “the
        one who taught me to mold them” and, as with the toad, provides a remedy
        of damp earth to extract the venom (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/110r/f/110r/tl"><u>110r</u></a>).
    </p>
    <p>Fumes and smells, too, could be harmful to the body as well as revealing
        material properties. In an entry on casting with a copper alloy called
        latten, the author-practitioner discusses the addition of calamine, a
        zinc ore, to the mixture, including the warning: “if you cast with
        recent calamine, keep away from the fumes, for they are pernicious”
        (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/136v/f/136v/tl"><u>136v</u></a>).
        Elsewhere, describing a flux for silver which contains a range of toxic
        ingredients, he advises that one should only attempt this procedure with
        adequate personal protection, that is, “keeping your face covered, over
        the nose &amp; the mouth, from the eyes down, to avoid the exhalations
        of arsenic, sublimate, and orpiment” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/123r/f/123r/tl"><u>123r</u></a>).
    </p>
    <p>This was evidently a common enough problem for someone working with
        metals, and it is explicitly addressed in a short entry titled “Antidote
        against the fumes of metals.” It reads, “in the morning, take a piece of
        toast with butter, &amp; neither antimony nor any other vapor will be
        able to harm you. Or put half a pig’s bladder in front of the face”
        (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/79v/f/79v/tl"><u>79v</u></a>).
        One could either shield oneself from the fumes, the author-practitioner
        suggests, or counteract their deleterious action within the body with an
        “antidote” of buttered toast. This tells us much about the way he
        conceived of the body’s place in and interaction with the workshop
        environment. While there is a sense of an inside and an outside, the two
        could interpenetrate, and fumes could reach within the body and disturb
        its healthful workings.</p>
    <p>Other fumes, of course, could do the opposite and be conducive to health.
        The “medicine of the orientals against all maladies,” for example,
        consists in inhaling the smoke of dried rosemary from a pipe and holding
        it inside one’s mouth and nose to do its healthful work (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/77r/f/77r/tl"><u>77r</u></a>).
        On the very last page of the manuscript, we find a medical recipe “for
        preserving,” in Latin this time, which also relies on fumes: a mixture
        of vinegar and juniper berries is poured onto hot bricks, and “the vapor
        shall be received through the mouth &amp; nostrils” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/170v/f/170v/tl"><u>170v</u></a>).
        This vapor served to preserve the body when venturing into “infected
        air”—many diseases including plague were thought to be caused by bad
        air—but could also work outside the body, to remove such unhealthy
        miasmas from clothes or homes.</p>
    <p>Deleterious interactions between body and materials were not, however,
        unidirectional. When changing the brine for preserving olives, for
        example, “one ought not to touch [it] with the hands, for this makes
        them spoil” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/93r/f/93r/tl"><u>93r</u></a>).
        Likewise, one should avoid touching fruits to be preserved, “for where
        the hand will touch, it will rot, and it is even good not to breathe on
        them” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/121r/f/121r/tl"><u>121r</u></a>).
        Indeed, bad breath could even disrupt glass painting: “if the
        glassworker who is working has a stench from his nose or his mouth,
        &amp; he breathes on the glass, the color will not take on it” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/37v/f/37v/tl"><u>37v</u></a>).
        As hot metals, poison, and disease could adversely affect the human body
        through touch and smell, so could the body’s unhealthful touch or
        exhalations spoil the works of nature and of man.</p>
    <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>This exploration of the author-practitioner’s “material sensorium” shows
        that the knowledge he collected in his manuscript was deeply informed by
        physical, sensory experience, and that he attempted to capture this
        expertise in writing, for example by describing key sensory cues—the
        temperature of metals and molds, the salinity of brine—which could spell
        success or failure. It is clear that he developed a complex sensory
        repertoire allowing him to make fine-grained distinctions, for example
        between consistencies of sand, right up to the point of impalpability,
        where sensation ceases altogether. This bodily interaction with and
        receptivity to materials often came at a cost: even as sensory
        experience informed and shaped embodied knowledge, it also changed the
        body in other ways, burning its exterior or disturbing its internal
        balance with toxic fumes, while the right kinds of fumes could cure
        disease. Conversely, the touch or exhalations of the body could
        interfere with the material world, and the artisan had to be just as
        cautious not to spoil his work by the touch or exhalation of his body as
        he had to be in protecting his body from harm. It is clear, then, that
        the author-practitioner, like many early modern people, conceived of the
        body as permeable and in constant exchange with the environment—an
        exchange which was as likely to be valuable and fruitful as it was to
        harm.</p>
