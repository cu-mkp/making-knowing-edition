        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <div>
            <p>This essay traces the use of the term <em>corps</em> in Ms. Fr.
                640, investigating its occurrence, meaning, and translation.
                While the term—which literally translates as “body”—seems
                straightforward to understand at first sight, close reading and
                comparison with contemporary sources and dictionaries reveals
                its complex web of meaning. Reconstructions underscore this fact
                and allow insight into the polysemic qualities of
                <em>corps</em>. Employing concepts from linguistics and
                anthropology, we argue that the author-practitioner employed
                <em>corps</em> as a rich linguistic strategy that allowed him to
                navigate the fields of practice and theory, to document or
                communicate aspects of artistic practice that would otherwise
                remain ineffable.</p>

    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
    <p>In two experiments, one in 2014 and one in 2016, students set out to make
        “a cast of wax to represent an animal that one has not got,” following
        the instructions of a handwritten recipe in the French late
        sixteenth-century manuscript BnF Ms. Fr. 640.<a href="#fn1"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref1"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> The students gathered the
        ingredients listed in the recipe (fols. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/139v/f/139v/tl"><u>139v</u></a>–<a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/140v/f/140v/tl"><u>140v</u></a>)
        for making a “black sulfured wax” especially suited for modelling or
        casting a wax model that “melts with very little heat and exits without
        leaving any filth.” The recipe calls for “white wax, which is more
        appropriate for this work than anything else because it is firmer &amp;
        does not leave as much filth,” “charcoal, pestled &amp; finely passed
        through a linen or a sleeve,” and “as much sulfur as a large walnut,”
        pulverized and melted over a slow fire. The addition of charcoal and
        sulfur enhance the molding properties of the white wax, as the
        author-practitioner explains: “This wax is very soft &amp; amiable &amp;
        pliant as copper, and it is so strong because of the sulfur, which
        renders it meltable much before the other,” while “the charcoal gives
        color to the wax, which would otherwise be transparent &amp; the
        features would not be seen as well.” Apparently as an afterthought, the
        author-practitioner noted that charcoal not only gives color, but also
        body to this wax mixture for molding round figures that are burnt in the
        mold. The addition “and body” (<em>et corps</em>) in superscript is
        puzzling. How can additives “give body”?</p>
    <p>Rozemarijn Landsman and Jonah Rowen (2014), and Charles Kang (2016)
        explored in several trials the influence of sulfur on wax and the
        effects of varying amounts of the black colorants soot and charcoal.<a
           href="#fn2"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref2"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> Their experiments confirmed the
        author-practitioner’s observation about the increased visibility of
        features when using black sulfured instead of white wax (<i><u>Fig. 1</u></i>). However, the addition of charcoal not only affected
        the visual properties of the wax. Kang’s experiments with substantial
        additions of finely pestled charcoal resulted in a viscous wax, more
        difficult to pour into a mold. And black charcoal powder seemingly
        affected the casting properties of wax in more ways: Kang’s mixture
        yielded casts with less shrinkage after cooling. Moreover, black
        sulfured waxes were much harder to carve after cooling and setting than
        the control samples, made from beeswax to which no “color and body” had
        been added.<a href="#fn3"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref3"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> Reading through the students’
        accounts of their reconstruction experiments, even more questions
        surfaced: What does it mean “to give body” to wax? Is <em>corps,</em>
        like color, related to visibility? Or does <em>corps</em> relate to the
        consistency of the mold material, as sulfur strengthened the soft and
        pliable wax, which was also observed by students reworking another
        recipe for casting sulfur (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/140v/f/140v/tl"><u>140v</u></a>)?<a
           href="#fn4"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref4"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> Evidently, the
        author-practitioner found it important to add the words “and body”
        (<em>et corps</em>) in his technical description, yet what could he mean
        when referring to the <em>corps</em> of materials in his
        sixteenth-century workshop? Searching for more instances in which the
        author-practitioner mentions <em>corps</em>, we discovered that the term
        appears with conspicuous frequency in descriptions of diverse artisanal
        processes throughout Ms. Fr. 640. In this essay we trace the term across
        the manuscript and examine how the author-practitioner used the concept
        of <em>corps</em> to convey and communicate artisanal knowledge—not only
        in casting recipes but also in recipes for color and varnish making. We
        reflect on the diverse ways in which <em>corps</em> relates to
        materialities and processes of artisanal practice, as described in Ms.
        Fr. 640. We furthermore show how systematic textual analysis (word
        search, tabular presentations of content), applied to the transcription
        as a whole, can help to map out the rich and complex semantic field of
        the meanings of <em>corps</em> in the context of the
        author-practitioner’s writing about craft practices.</p>

    <p>Our comparative research suggests similarities between the
        author-practitioner’s conception of <em>corps</em> and that found in
        other earlier and roughly contemporary art technological sources, which
        also discuss the properties of artists’ materials in terms of
        <em>corps</em>, such as the more widely known fifteenth-century
        Strasbourg manuscript as well as the early modern miscellaneous
        collection of art technological notes Ms. Sloane 2052, compiled—mostly
        in French—by and for Sir Theodore de Mayerne (1573–1655) and often
        referred to as the “Mayerne Manuscript.”<a href="#fn5"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref5"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> Our observations suggest that the
        author-practitioner and De Mayerne partook in a more widely-used
        <em>corps</em> terminology to describe artisanal materials and
        processes. Theodore de Mayerne’s recipe collection, of which the first
        print editions and translations appeared in the nineteenth century, has
        a much longer and richer reception history than Ms. Fr. 640.<a
           href="#fn6"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref6"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> This allows us to discuss how
        other editors of modern editions have dealt with the translation and
        interpretation of <em>corps</em> in the context of artisanal practices,
        in particular historical recipes for colormaking, and preparations of
        paints, pigments, oils, and varnishes.&nbsp;This essay thus aims to
        contribute to the translation and interpretation of a term that invokes
        a surprisingly complex field of meanings.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>For our conceptual analyses we combine insights from the history of art,
        history of science, and conservation studies with related approaches in
        language studies and cultural anthropology. We draw, for example, on
        recent research in comparative color anthropology and linguistics,
        investigating “strategies that speakers have available to manage
        phenomena or domains of experience that are inexpressible or difficult
        to express in their language.”<a href="#fn7"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref7"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> This allows us to explore
        constructively <em>how</em> the author-practitioner deals with
        “ineffability” in his writings and how he works with practice-based
        conceptualizations to navigate domains of artisanal making that are or
        appear to be indescribable. We therefore propose in this essay to
        discuss the author-practitioner’s use of <em>corps</em> as a linguistic
        strategy with which he manages domains of experience in craft practice
        that are difficult to express in writing. Discussing <em>corps</em>
        terminology as a linguistic strategy for navigating ineffable domains
        allows us to move beyond the much-cited tropes in the historiography of
        early modern craft writing that tend to remain focussed on the
        inexpressibility of putting artisanal know-how into words. Consequently,
        instead of trying to provide a condensed and static definition of what
        <em>corps</em> means in context of the artisanal recipes we examined, we
        focus on <em>how</em> the author-practitioner made efficient use of the
        polysemic concept of <em>corps</em> to point to important perceptual
        aspects and sensory cues in casting, modelling, and paint, color, and
        varnish making.</p>
    <p>We show that his strategy is grounded in the expertise of a skilled
        practitioner, with a keen interest in&nbsp;experimental exploration of
        artisanal materials and techniques. We argue that performative and
        material engagements with the recipe texts by reconstruction experiments
        are a vital complement to qualitative and quantitative textual analysis
        in various ways. Many of the historical concepts that we encounter in
        recipe texts may appear self-evident to a modern reader, especially
        those that can be easily translated into modern nomenclature, as in the
        case of <em>corps</em> that is literally translatable into English as
        “body.” However, as we try to show here, technical historical concepts
        can reveal unexpected semantic richness, conceptual conciseness, and
        observational acuity, as well as partly unfamiliar or surprising
        meanings and connotations, when they are worked through alongside a
        combination of textual reading methods and hands-on methods.<a

           id="fnref8"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>While we observe that the author-practitioner of Ms. Fr. 640 certainly
        did not set forth a systematic corpuscular theory of colors, substances,
        or material interactions as they were developed in natural historical
        and philosophical writings around the same time, we do believe that the
        author-practitioner’s writings are a testimony to a sophisticated and
        fine-tuned conceptual framework grounded in a practice-based
        <em>corps</em> terminology.</p>

    <p>The author-practitioner judges the suitability of materials or varieties
        of materials for specific purposes. Practitioners choose the material
        with the optimal degree of <em>corps</em> for their specific needs and
        applications. For instance, the choice between two types of lead
        white—ceruse and <em>blanc de plomb</em>—depends on the <em>corps</em>
        best suited to the work at hand, for example, in the case of small-scale
        paintings (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/61r/f/61r/tl"><u>61r</u></a>):
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Lead white</p>
        <p>Without this, you cannot work on a small scale, for which one needs
            to soften with great care. But you cannot do it with ceruse because
            it does not have enough body [<em>corps</em>].</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>In another example, a recipe for a starch
        size for gilding on parchment, attention is given to preparing a ground
        layer with “no body” (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/10v/f/10v/tl"><u>10v</u></a>):
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Ground layer for gold leaf on parchment or paper</p>
        <p>Make very clear&nbsp;starch glue&nbsp;&amp; which does not show
            itself to have body. And make thereof six or five layers, &amp; on
            the last, once it is half dried, apply your&nbsp;gold.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>On the basis of the above text, one might be tempted to think of
        <em>corps</em> in terms of core features of materials or might assume
        that the concept connotes intrinsic affordances of specific materials.
        Yet other descriptions in Ms. Fr. 640 strongly suggest that what
        constitutes the <em>corps</em> of a material is not necessarily
        something fixed but rather that it connotes processes of transformation,
        enhancement, or material manipulation. What makes up the <em>corps</em>
        of a material can be adapted or changed by certain processes and
        treatments. Several recipes describe methods to actively modify the
        <em>corps,</em> such as a recipe for a quick-drying varnish for which
        the ingredients have to be processed until the mixture has gained the
        right amount of <em>corps</em> (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/60v/f/60v/tl"><u>60v</u></a>):
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Varnish dry in one hour</p>
        <p>Take white turpentine oil &amp; turpentine &amp; mastic, pulverized
            &amp; passed delicately through a sieve, &amp; boil together,
            stirring continuously with a stick until it is dry. And put in two
            liards’ worth of good eau-de-vie. And if you extract the tear of
            mastic, it will be whiter &amp; clearer. There is no need to put in
            turpentine, but only its white turpentine oil &amp; mastic
            pulverized at your discretion, until it has enough body
            [<em>corps</em>]. +</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>The author-practitioner added a “footnote”
        in the left margin, explaining a technique or method for assessing if a
        material has enough <em>corps</em>:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>+ which one knows when, being placed on a knife in the wind, it does
            not run. This one is excellent for panels and is dry within an hour
            and does not stick like the turpentine one.<a href="#fn13"
               class="footnote-ref"
               id="fnref13"
               role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>To evaluate or assess the <em>corps</em>
        of a material and estimate whether it has enough or too little body
        appears to be a matter of constant concern, not only for the compiler of
        Ms. Fr. 640 but also for painters, as documented by Sir Theodore de
        Mayerne in Ms. Sloane 2052.<a href="#fn14"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref14"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> We come across a similar
        description in De Mayerne’s hand on fol. 85v. This recipe provides
        instructions for a glazing lake that should be processed until its
        <em>corps</em> has the consistency of butter: “lake for glazing should
        be mixed with a little oil and ground as thick as butter so that it can
        be cut; otherwise it has no body &amp; is worthless.”<a href="#fn15"

    <p>Sometimes much <em>corps</em> is wished for, as in the lead white recipe
        above, while too much <em>corps</em> may also be undesirable. In some
        cases combining materials with and without <em>corps</em> works best, as
        the author-practitioner explains in detail in an entry discussing the
        merits of “Toulouse sand”<a href="#fn16"

    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>This example also illustrates how one and
        the same raw material can be worked by hand into different degrees of
        <em>corps</em> and then becomes suited to different purposes. Indeed,
        experiments with a batch of modern Toulouse sand from a region
        recommended by the author-practitioner (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/81r/f/81r/tl"><u>81r</u></a>)
        demonstrate how one can manually work the <em>corps</em> of sand of
        Toulouse in different ways, thus attaining a “finest sand”—which is
        pounced onto the surface of the medal in its dry form (without any
        binding additives) through a very fine linen cloth—and a coarser,
        moistened sand “which has more body” that is applied on top of this
        first fine layer. The metal expert Tonny Beentjes taught us in the
        Making and Knowing lab to prepare a sandcasting mold in this manner, a
        practice that we could also observe in one of the last extant
        professional sandcasting metal workshops in New York, which we
        visited.<a href="#fn17"

    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>Additional terms, used to describe varying
        degrees of <em>corps</em>, further confirm the high level of precision
        in the author-practitioner’s <em>corps</em> language: materials can have
        more (<em>plus de</em>) <em>corps</em> than others, they can take on
        (<em>prend de</em>) or maintain (<em>retient</em>) their <em>corps</em>
        throughout diverse manipulations, and there are numerous means and
        methods to give body (<em>donner</em> <em>corps</em>) to materials and
        to make body (<em>faire</em> <em>corps</em>). Furthermore, several
        techniques are described that allow practitioners to navigate the
        continuous scale of different levels of <em>corps</em> by playing with
        the amounts of ingredients or by modification of the materials
        themselves. The author-practitioner in one instance even notes that one
        can create “whatever body [<em>corps</em>] you want” (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/3r/f/3r/tl"><u>3r</u></a>).
        The many collocations (terms that occur next to one another) we found
        when tracing the use of <em>corps</em> through Ms. Fr. 640 and Ms.
        Sloane 2052 suggest that the compilers of these manuscripts had a rich
        vocabulary at their disposal from which they could choose when
        describing the <em>corps</em> of materials.<a href="#fn19"

        we find the following list of words that define crucial know-how for

        <em>compaction</em>, <em>pour despouiller</em>, <em>soubstenir</em>,
        <em>subtil</em>, <em>impalpable</em>, and <em>grosset</em> (for better

        those in recipes for sand casting confirms that connotations of the term
        may vary according to artistic medium the author-practitioner is
        discussing. When reviewing the varnish recipes that mention
        <em>corps,</em> it may seem that absence of body refers to clarity or
        transparency and (thin or aqueous) liquidity, while absence of
        <em>corps</em> in ingredients for casting recipes has different effects
        that may result in suboptimal release from the mold, less sharply
        detailed casts, or an insufficient bond of mold materials and thus a
        lack of structural integrity in the casting mold.</p>
    <p>The conceptual importance of <em>corps</em> in conveying material
        literacy and artisanal expertise became evident when reworking artisanal
        recipes from Ms. Fr. 640 and Ms. Sloane 2052. To explore the meaning of
        <em>corps</em> in different art-technological contexts, in the next
        sections we draw on close readings of recipe texts and on reports of
        experiences and experimental reconstructions that were performed by
        students and researchers involved in the project, including ourselves.
        The following thick descriptions of the term <em>corps</em> in casting,
        color, and varnish recipes will elucidate how <em>corps</em> operates in
        the context of different artisanal practices. Interestingly, we observed
        that connotations of <em>corps</em> can be clarified through corporeal
        interactions with the recipes, such as those that took place in the
        reconstruction laboratories at Columbia University and at the Atelier
        building in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. This highlights the
        methodological value of such an approach. A closer look at the casting
        recipes in Ms. Fr. 640 provides a first insight into the complex web of
        meaning associated with the term.</p>
    <h2 id="corps-in-casting-recipes"><em>Corps</em> in Casting Recipes </h2>
    <p>The author-practitioner’s keen interest in mold materials for casting
        techniques, in particular his focus on the right sand for metal casting,
        is evident in the number of recipes devoted to the topic and echoed in
        the frequency with which it is discussed by researchers and students who
        have engaged with this manuscript.<a href="#fn21"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref21"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a> In many instances, the
        author-practitioner of Ms. Fr. 640 makes assertions about the core
        qualities of molding sands, and the <em>corps</em> of a sand is clearly
        one of them. In the margins of a recipe for artificial sand (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/89v/f/89v/tl"><u>89v</u></a>),
        he notes: “all sand that releases well has body &amp; gives a good
        hold.” Terms connoting compaction, bond, and cohesion are frequent in
        the casting recipes. The concept of <em>corps</em> also appears to
        relate closely to a testing method we came to refer to in the Making and
        Knowing Lab as the “squeeze test,” used when trying to assess a sand’s
        quality and readiness to be used for molding. In order to “mold very
        neatly” with a mixture containing sal ammoniac, the author-practitioner
        advises to “moisten it&nbsp;in a damp place&nbsp;for two or
        three&nbsp;days, &amp; so that when you take&nbsp;fistfuls, it holds
        together, without, however, attaching itself &amp; being pasted to
        your&nbsp;hand” (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/89v/f/89v/tl"><u>89v</u></a>).
    </p>
    <p>We also observed a close proximity between <em>corps</em> and two other
        key concepts used by the author-practitioner to describe the complex
        process of making mold materials for metal casting and for assessing the
        quality of mold materials: the concepts “fat” (<em>gras</em>) and “lean”
        (<em>maigre</em>).<a href="#fn22"

        contributions to this Edition, these terms had important explanatory
        functions in early modern understandings of materials, not only in the

        he advises not to choose a sand “that is in any way so lean &amp; arid
        that it does not have bond, like&nbsp;the one from

            <del>desei</del>
        </em>&nbsp;from&nbsp;sandy paths&nbsp;dried out by the&nbsp;sun.”
        Instead, he recommends a local sand: “The sand near my area is very
        excellent. But one ought to, in order to make an excellent work, take it
        fresh, which has been hardly put to work. For it dries out after having
        been cast several times &amp; is lean &amp; has no body
        [<em>corps</em>].”<a href="#fn24"

           id="fnref24"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a>&nbsp;In a marginal note on the
        same folio, the author-practitioner provides a list of “fatty things” to
        compensate for a lack of <em>corps</em> in natural sand: “It is good for
        big work, but for small ones it is troublesome for releasing&nbsp;<em>
            <del>Il</del>
        </em>&nbsp;because it crumbles. It is good that it be a little alloyed

    <p>Ameliorating the <em>corps</em> of casting sand is discussed elsewhere in
        another recipe calling for the “Sand from a&nbsp;mine in&nbsp;Thoulouse”
        (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/84r/f/84r/tl"><u>84r</u></a>),
        which “is excellent in itself,” but can be enhanced for unlimited reuse:
        “[...] to make it withstand several castings, I mix it with pulverized
        sandever &amp; moistened, which hardens it, &amp; takes body &amp; bond
        with it, &amp; makes it withstand <del>more than five</del> as many
        castings as you wish.”</p>
    <p>In another recipe for “Sand for copper medals” (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/83r/f/83r/tl"><u>83r</u></a>),
        the author-practitioner gives advice on how to make artificial sands for
        molding from “hat felt burnt on a covered fire, dross of iron, &amp;
        burnt bone, all of which ground very finely
        &amp;&nbsp;pestled&nbsp;&amp; watered with&nbsp;saltwater.” He notes
        that “burnt hat felt molds very neatly and releases very neatly.” This
        observation is confirmed in a marginal note, where we also learn that
        burnt bone “has scarcely any body unless it has iron dross.”</p>
    <p>A master mold maker apparently needs not only the skill to recognize when
        a mold material has enough or the right amount of <em>corps</em>, but in
        order to produce high quality artefacts and to work efficiently, he also
        needs to learn how “to give body” to materials that are too lean and to
        make materials, that otherwise show insufficient resilience,“take
        body.”<a href="#fn26"

    <p>Students reworked several casting recipes to explore the use, merits, and

        term that appears to be used in roughly contemporary recipes for tin
        casting and alchemical recipes to describe a (liquid) agent that ensures
        a desired bonding in naturally occurring sands or in mixtures that often
        consist of mostly dry ingredients. Magistery is key for making good
        molding sands. Biringuccio warns that without magistery, the
        (artificial) sand would not hold its place, retain the dryness of a
        powder, and therefore, it would not mold well in a casting flask. In
        addition, he points out that magistery renders the sand molds hard and

        them withstand repeated casts (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/85r/f/85r/tl"><u>85r</u></a>):

    <blockquote>
        <p>This worked very well and I molded a medal of high relief very
            neatly, without any sticking, which a lot of good sands, such as
            felt, burnt bone &amp; iron dross, had failed to do on the first
            try. I reheated it &amp; my mold became hard like marble, and by
            this I knew that sands for molding high relief should be well
            moistened with some water, which gives them body &amp; compactness,
            such as glair, gummed water, <del>ea</del> wine boiled with elm
            root, &amp;c; and lightly oil the medal, it withstands as many
            castings as you wish, for it is as hard as glass.</p>

    <p>The reports of the author-practitioner’s trials with liquid binding
        agents convey a close conceptual proximity between the terms
        <em>corps</em> and <em>magistra</em>. In achieving the right
        <em>corps</em> when preparing sands for molding, a delicate balance is
        sought between hardness and malleability. Intuitively, liquid agents
        seem most appropriate to moisten dry/lean materials such as sands “that
        have no corps,” “dried out sand,” “sand from the mines, overheated,” and
        “burnt bones.” However, as experienced makers know, and as we discovered
        by reconstruction in the Making and Knowing lab, dry hygroscopic
        materials can serve the same purpose, when placed in a humid
        environment. Experiments following a recipe for “Sand of burnt ox bones
        and rock salt” (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/89r/f/89r/tl"><u>89r</u></a>)
        show that burnt and pulverized ox bone, which of itself is “very arid
        &amp; lean” (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/84v/f/84v/tl"><u>84v</u></a>),
        can be worked into an exceptional molding sand by folding it with rock
        salt into moistened paper wrapped in a moist cloth, preferably working
        in a humid environment like a cellar.<a href="#fn32"

        we find instructions on how Toulouse sand can be processed to yield the
        right sands for a first and second layer of a mold. The
        author-practitioner describes how “others” attain, through extensive
        grinding and gently heating, a sand that becomes so very fine it is
        “like impalpable.” By adding a liquid agent, this very fine sand can be
        worked into a mold material that releases very neatly:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Sand of the&nbsp;mine&nbsp;of&nbsp;Thoulouse</p>
        <p>[...] Others beat it well in a&nbsp;mortar, in small amounts at a
            time, &amp; thus it is&nbsp;pressed together&nbsp;and rendered very
            fine. Then they reheat it moderately, only to dry it. Next, they
            grind it dry on&nbsp;porphyry. And thus it becomes as if impalpable,
            and not too dried out,&nbsp;it&nbsp;and it retains the body &amp;
            the bond of the&nbsp;earth&nbsp;to which it is kin, and is better
            than when it is so burnt. Once moistened with&nbsp;glair of egg
            passed through a&nbsp;sponge, it releases&nbsp;<del>very
                neatly&nbsp;M</del>&nbsp;very neatly in low relief, but not for
            figures in high relief.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>The author-practitioner’s own experiments
        with extensive grinding and sieving of mold materials and the addition
        of binding agents are described in several locations, amongst which
        fols. <a

    <p>The entry on fol. 85v, entitled “Experimented sands,” suggests that the
        author-practitioner preferred local natural sand, possibly related to
        the previously mentioned distinct qualities of Toulouse sand. He praised
        it for retaining body and bond (<em>corps &amp; liaison</em>) when
        rendered impalpable—both properties required for a good mold. In fact,
        the author-practitioner comments frequently on the necessity of grinding
        mold material extremely finely, “until it is not felt between your
        fingers” (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/84v/f/84v/tl"><u>84v</u></a>),
        a quality that also characterizes the fine grain of today’s industrially
        manufactured commercial molding sands.</p>
    <p>During the lab seminars we experienced how much manual labor it actually
        takes to render our sands almost impalpable.<a href="#fn33"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref33"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a> The technical instructions in
        Ms. Fr. 640 thus testify also to the laborious embodied practices that
        are involved in manipulating the <em>corps</em> of sands. Based on such
        reworkings, we conjecture that the <em>corps</em> terminology in
        artisanal recipes hints perhaps also at the distinctive corporeal
        dimensions of the act of artisanal making and of manual transformation
        of materials, including the intensive and skilled bodily work needed to
        modify the <em>corps</em> of sands.<a href="#fn34"
           class="footnote-ref"

           role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
    <p>Working through the recipes in the Making and Knowing lab taught us that
        the author-practitioner employed—and perhaps also
        devised—conceptualizations that belong to concise technical terminology,
        grounded in embodied practices and sensory experiences of skilled
        makers. The term <em>impalpable</em>, mentioned above, is a good example
        of such a conceptualization: the term denotes a particular softness,
        perceived by touch. In Biringuccio’s metalworking treatise, “impalpable”
        (<em>impalpabile</em>) attains the meaning of a concise technical term
        that defines a key quality of (artificial) mold materials.<a
           href="#fn35"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref35"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>35</sup></a> Reconstruction experiments
        showed that the term is likely used in a similar specific technical
        sense in Ms. Fr. 640. This informed the decision to consistently
        translate <em>impalpable</em> as a technical term (using the same word
        in English). Further below, we make a similar argument for translating
        <em>corps</em> throughout as “body,” yet this time we seek
        terminological consistency in the English translation in order to convey
        the conspicuous multi-layered meanings of body notions (i.e.,
        <em>corps</em> terminology) in art technological descriptions.</p>
    <p>Attention to <em>corps</em> is very clear in sand recipes for metal
        casting. The concept of <em>corps</em> enables the author-practitioner
        to describe desired properties of sand mold materials, how they can be
        achieved through sourcing of suitable materials (e.g., choosing sands
        from the right location),<a href="#fn36"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref36"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>36</sup></a> by processing (e.g., heating,
        beating, pestling, sieving), or enriching with particular means and
        methods (e.g., with dry or liquid additives), much of which is explained
        in unmatched detail in Ms. Fr. 640. The right <em>corps</em> will ensure
        good releasing of the mold (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/29r/f/29r/tl"><u>29r</u></a>:
        “if it does not release well, mix in more flour until it has enough
        body”) and will provide strength, firmness, and durability so that the
        mold keeps its shape (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/70r/f/70r/tl"><u>70r</u></a>:
        “enough body to withstand copper;” fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/84r/f/84r/tl"><u>84r</u></a>:
        “to make it withstand several castings”). <em>Corps</em> is also
        instrumental in achieving a precise and sharply detailed cast (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/70r/f/70r/tl"><u>70r</u></a>:
        “molds very neatly”).<a href="#fn37"

           role="doc-noteref"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
    <p>Methods and agents for ensuring a better release of the cast, like
        vegetable oils, are also discussed in terms of having/not having
        <em>corps</em>. For instance, an entry for casting <em>en noyau</em> to
        make “wax&nbsp;images or&nbsp;lead&nbsp;medals and such like” gives
        instructions to “anoint your images of&nbsp;wax&nbsp;or
        of&nbsp;lead&nbsp;with&nbsp;olive&nbsp;oil, very thinly &amp; very
        lightly, such that the&nbsp;oil&nbsp;makes no thickness nor body
        [<em>corps</em>] on the medal” (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/116r/f/116r/tl"><u>116r</u></a>).<a

        oil “that is appropriate to anoint” the finest and most delicate parts
        of an animal, like “the hair of a butterfly,” by heating the oil first.
        Similarly, the author-practitioner added a marginal note in which he
        recommends to use wheat oil (<em>huile de froment</em>) for molding
        “something delicate, like a pansy,” instead of rubbing the petals with
        butter as others do “to give it a little thickness, more than what is
        natural” (fol. <a

        &amp; does not obstruct the small lineaments as much, and makes the
        flower firm” (<i><u>Fig. 7</u></i>).<a href="#fn39"

    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>Note, however, that in the context of
        casting recipes for “Molding a fly” (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/156v/f/156v/tl"><u>156v</u></a>)
        and “Molding a rat” (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/152r/f/152r/tl"><u>152r</u></a>),
        the author-practitioner warns against this same wheat oil as an
        anointing agent, exactly because of its thickness and <em>corps</em>,
        adding in the margins that butter is better for anointing hairy animals,
        like rats, “because it is more amiable [<em>amiable</em>]” (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/152r/f/152r/tl"><u>152r</u></a>).
        Apparently, preparing delicate things for molding demands not only acute
        attention to body parts of animals and flowers but also to the
        <em>corps</em> of release agents. Not only oils and fats but also
        well-chosen carbon-based blacks are recommended as release layers in
        casting (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/84v/f/84v/tl"><u>84v</u></a>):
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Charcoal for pouncing makes for a good release, but one finds that
            the one of willow makes it porous. The one of oak or beech does
            <del>make it porous</del> well without making it porous.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>In a recipe for <em>en noyau</em> casting
        (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/158v/f/158v/tl"><u>158v</u></a>),
        the author-practitioner also attributes the suitability of the smoke of
        a candle as a release layer to its lack of <em>corps</em>:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Candle smoke</p>
        <p>It makes it come out neater, &amp; even if it is a little thick, it
            does not hold to any place because it has no body [<em>corps</em>].
            I have thus fumigated my <em>noyau</em> molds for tin &amp; lead,
            and have cast in the cold mold, well dried beforehand, and it came
            out very neat.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>We have seen in other recipes that
        <em>corps</em> is often associated with thickness, implying that a lack
        of <em>corps</em> may relate to thinness. When discussing the quality of
        release agents that are applied on top of the surface patterns of
        casting models, it seems perhaps most likely that a release agent with
        no <em>corps</em> connotes a material that can be applied as a very thin
        separation layer. However, the above recipe makes plain that lack of
        <em>corps</em> is not synonymous with thinness: the author-practitioner
        observes here that even if the smoke of a candle is “a little thick,” it
        still works very well as a release agent “because it has no body.” The
        recipe subsequently makes clear that candle smoke makes for such a good
        release agent, because “it does not hold to any place” (fol. 158v). A
        lack of adhesion certainly makes practical sense, as a release layer is
        applied to ensure that the mold material separates easily from the cast
        medal. So, while smoke black might have some thickness, a characteristic
        that could elsewhere classify it as a material in possession of some
        <em>corps</em>, it is recommended here because it has “no body.” This
        shows that in the context of casting, at least in the particular context
        of release layers, no <em>corps</em> may refer to low adhesive
        properties. This delicate shift of meaning points towards a certain
        polysemic quality of the term; <em>corps</em> is fluid and takes on
        different meanings depending on context and purpose.</p>
    <p>Polysemy in <em>corps</em> language can also be observed in wax molding
        recipes. In a marginal note on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/153r/f/153r/tl"><u>153r</u></a>,
        the author-practitioner advises to mix wax with black colorants, like
        the smoke of a lamp, that have “hardly any body, in order that you see
        the imprint better” when carving a pattern into your wax model, a remark
        that makes clear that carbon-based blacks can occur in casting recipes
        as both release agents and colorants: nothing sticks to candle smoke,
        and the very fine black lamp smoke gives a dark color to molding wax.
    </p>
    <p>Indeed, as we have already seen at the beginning of this essay, the
        rendering of delicate features in wax is an issue demanding acute
        attention to <em>corps.</em> Students also explored the
        author-practitioner’s recommendation for adding another black—charcoal
        (<em>charbon</em>)—to the wax for making a model for “casting in wax an
        animal that one has not got” (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/139v/f/139v/tl"><u>139v</u></a>).
        In this recipe the author-practitioner explains that tinted waxes are
        better suited for wax modelling because the colorant reduces the wax’s
        transparency:<a href="#fn40"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref40"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Take some&nbsp;white wax&nbsp;which is more appropriate for this work
            than anything else, because it is firmer &amp; does not leave as
            much&nbsp;filth, as much as you need to mold the animal that you
            propose, &amp; no more, and&nbsp;half&nbsp;as
            much&nbsp;charcoal,&nbsp;pestled&nbsp;&amp; finely passed through
            a&nbsp;linen&nbsp;or a&nbsp;sleeve. The&nbsp;charcoal&nbsp;gives
            color&nbsp;<sup>and body [<em>corps</em>]</sup>&nbsp;to
            the&nbsp;wax, which would otherwise be transparent &amp; the
            features would not be seen as well.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>Only upon close examination of the folio
        did it become apparent that the addition “and body” (<em>et corps</em>)
        had likely been made later, suggesting—as mentioned above—that the
        author-practitioner realized only after writing, maybe in practice, that
        charcoal black has more affordances besides color, and that working fine
        charcoal powder into the white wax might enhance or enrich the molding
        wax in more ways than one (<i><u>Fig. 8</u></i>). Perhaps the pestled
        and finely sieved charcoal also helped—like the addition of sulfur—to
        give firmness to the wax, which by itself tends quickly to become (too)
        soft and pliable when worked by hand.<a href="#fn41"

    <p>These examples show how the author-practitioner—as writer and as

        fine-tune intricate details of practice, details that embody physical
        and workable aspects as well as visual or perceptual ones. The above

        charcoal, serve well to illustrate how <em>corps</em> terminology
        stretches across the disciplinary distinctions of casting and painting,
        which are separated in art history and conservation studies today.</p>

        in early modern Europe.<a href="#fn43"

        Mayerne provides a list of “Colors that have no body or very little
        body.” His list includes smoke black, which is here described as having
        body, “but not much”:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Colors that have no, or very little, body. The Lake has none of it.
            The verdigris has none of it. The one and the other serve for

            much. Ivory black or bones of sheeps’ trotters is much better has

    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>In an entry on “Ordinary colors for oil”
        (<em>Couleurs ordinaires pour huile</em>), De Mayerne documents in
        detail the production and application of ivory and bone black, favored
        by painters for having “less body” than smoke black:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>The strongest black is made with ivory, burnt in a well-closed iron
            vessel, with Lutum &amp; salt. The black has no body, &amp; is to be
            placed over another black of lamp as in glazing, &amp; then it is
            black in extremity.<a href="#fn46"

               id="fnref46"
               role="doc-noteref"><sup>46</sup></a></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>Ivory black is used here as a glaze,
        implying that the pigment retains a certain translucency in oil. Applied
        as a second layer over a black first layer, the glaze deepens the black
        tonality. The suitability of colors with little or no <em>corps</em> for
        glazing is also discussed by the author-practitioner in Ms. Fr. 640 in a
        recipe entitled “Glazing” (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/65v/f/65v/tl"><u>65v</u></a>).
        He adds advice on how to render colors with more body suitable for
        glazing by adding <em>cristallin</em>—a material described as having no
        <em>corps</em>:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Glazing</p>
        <p>One commonly glazes with colors that do not have body, such as lake
            &amp; verdigris. However, to use other colors, one mixes in a
            quantity of calcined &amp; ground <em>cristallin</em>, which also
            has no body &amp; <del>makes</del> lightens the density of the
            others.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>In both the author-practitioner’s and De Mayerne’s recipes, the lack of
        <em>corps</em> appears closely associated with clarity and transparency.
        Note, for example, the correction and the use of the Middle French term
        <em>esclarcist</em>, which is defined in the <em>Dictionnaire du Moyen
            Français (1330–1500)</em> (DMF) as “giving light to” (<em>donner de
            la lumière à</em>), or “illuminating” (<em>illuminer</em>).<a
           href="#fn47"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref47"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>47</sup></a> The term is further associated
        with making “clear” and “brilliant” (<em>rendre clair</em>,
        <em>brilliant</em>), thus not only carrying connotations of transparency
        and translucency but also of luminosity and shimmer. The “lightening”
        effect of calcined and crushed <em>cristallin</em>, due to its lack of
        body, is described by the author-practitioner as a modifier for the
        “thickness” or heaviness (<em>espesseur</em>) of other colors.</p>
    <p>Similarly, De Mayerne’s recipe collection contains a description of a
        painting technique for rendering the appearance and texture of
        “transparent linen,” in which “no body” (<em>nul corps</em>) is closely
        associated with transparency:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Crêpe or transparent linen. A crêpe is made by trailing one’s white
            so dry that it does not leave any body to cover all one will see
            through &amp; at the same time, one dashes off only the traces and
            soft folds and leaving the rest void.<a href="#fn48"

    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>Turning back again to Ms. Fr. 640, we
        encounter the phrasing “clear as water” (<em>cler comme eau</em>) on
        fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/58v/f/58v/tl"><u>58v</u></a>
        in a recipe where it is related to an oil that “has no body” (<em>nha
            poinct de corps</em>) and in a recipe for “scratching satin” (fol.
        <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/42v/f/42v/tl"><u>42v</u></a>)
        that describes a method for pouncing a pattern onto satin fabric using
        flour or chalk and then tracing it with a special sizing “which will
        immediately make it [i.e., the pattern] clear up like water, &amp;
        without becoming thick [<em>sans faire corps</em>], it will keep the
        trace.”<a href="#fn49"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref49"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>49</sup></a> This phrase was translated as
        “without becoming thick, it will keep the trace.” However, despite the
        close conceptual proximity between “thickness” and <em>corps</em> in
        color and casting recipes, the recurring contrast between clarity and
        <em>corps</em> in Ms. Fr. 640 becomes lost when substituting “becoming
        thick” for the polysemic concept <em>corps</em>.</p>
    <p>Notably, in De Mayerne’s compilation we can find more examples where
        <em>corps</em> terminology is used to describe both the different colors
        for painting and the structural qualities of colorants. For example, in
        a recipe for <em>damasquinerie</em>, a decorative technique in which a
        pattern is scratched into a paint layer applied over gold or silver
        leaf, he added a note, describing how to make a paint that can withstand
        the scratching of a (metal) point without flaking off. The description
        testifies to De Mayerne’s own first hand observations of this artisanal
        technique:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>NB I have seen it done. When you grind your color, when it has no or
            little <em>corps</em> like lake you have to mix in a little chalk to
            give it <em>corps</em>, to sustain the cut of the point, otherwise
            it flakes.<a href="#fn50"
               class="footnote-ref"
               id="fnref50"
               role="doc-noteref"><sup>50</sup></a></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>While <em>corps</em> has connotations of thickness and fattiness in both
        casting and color recipes, associations with transparency appear to be
        idiosyncratic for color and painting recipes. This is manifest in a note
        by the author-practitioner next to an entry entitled “Fatty colors”
        (<em>Couleurs grasses</em>) on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/65r/f/65r/tl"><u>65r</u></a>.
        His observations illustrate a close association of a color’s “thickness”
        (<em>espesse</em>) and its “fattiness” (<em>grasse</em>) with having
        <em>corps</em>, while “clarity” (<em>claires</em>) seems to denote a
        lack of <em>corps</em>:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>All fatty colors, such as ceruse and minium, massicot, ocher, lead
            white, are good for making gold color. Every color or thing that
            becomes dense [<em>qui se rend epaisse</em>] when water is put in
            during the grinding has body [<em>corps</em>]. But those which do
            not have it, such as pestled glass, lake, &amp;c, become clear.<a

        has been translated as “paint” (rather than “color”) in Donald C. Fels’s
        English edition of the “Mayerne Manuscript,” a choice for emphasis on
        the material instead of the coloring aspect of the term. Such editorial
        choices call for more in-depth research into the semantics of

        <em>corps</em> to describe the consistency of a varnish:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Oils suitable for making varnish are those of walnut, and of linseed;
            these alone, rendered dessicative with litharge or (which is better)

    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>The meaning of <em>corps</em> in this
        recipe remains elusive without knowledge of the other oils that walnut
        oil or linseed oil are compared to. <em>Corps</em> may relate to
        properties like fatness or consistency, to layer thickness, or to the
        gloss of a varnish. And possibly the rich varnishes that were made with
        nut oil had a bit of each: fattiness, thickness, and glossiness. Ernst
        Berger chose, in the first comprehensive print edition and German
        translation of De Mayerne’s manuscript, published in 1901, not for a
        literal translation of <em>corps</em> into the German <em>Körper</em>,
        but used instead an explanatory description and interpreted the term as
        <em>konsistenter</em>, translated verbatim as “more consistent” in the
        more recently published first English translation by Fels.<a

        as it seems unnecessary. Why did both editors choose to abandon the rich
        connotations of <em>corps</em> for a more restricted—and
        debatable—alternative term? In another recipe, describing the
        preparation of materials for “the true a varnish for lutes and viols” on
        fol. 43v, De Mayerne describes how <em>carabé</em> resin transforms when
        heated on a fire: “Il se fond en un corps obscure qui semble la
        colophone,” translated by Berger as “Er schmilzt zu einem schwarzen
        Körper, der wie Kolophonium aussieht” (“It melts into a black body that

        semantic ambiguity becoming lost in translation, as the possible

        while the <em>corps</em> of <em>carabé</em> resin might resemble the
        properties of colophony in more ways. Fels takes us even a further step
        away from <em>corps</em> in his English edition, by translating Berger’s
        “schwarzen Körper” as “black mass.”<a href="#fn58"

        range of material as well as immaterial aspects, both visual and
        perceptual.</p>
    <p>There are other instances, in particular in the section with varnish
        recipes, where Berger and Fels felt tempted to (over)interpret
        <em>corps</em> in translation. The dated recipe for an amber varnish on
        fol. 48v, “vernix d’Ambre. 8 Febr. 1631,” testifies to De Mayerne’s
        difficulties with dissolving <em>carabé</em> resin in spike oil and
        turpentine oil. The addition of “a little very clear distilled Carabé
        oil” provided a solution for the issue, as it “instantly penetrated the
        <em>corps</em>.”<a href="#fn59"

        Fels into English as “substantial body” in a recipe for yellow which
        appears on folio 122v in the “Mayerne Manuscript.”<a href="#fn60"

        technological writings. This is apparent in a compelling description of
        the production of artists’ pigment from an early fifteenth-century copy

        as having no substance, the author clearly refrained from simply

            conceal them, on account of its thinness, transparency, and rarity,
            owing to which other colors appear through it, wherefore this color
            as well as the said green color is overpowered, and shows little or

    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>Luckily, our comparative survey of De

        translations showed that divergent translations of <em>corps</em>
        terminology are exceptions. In most instances both editors opted for a
        literal translation of <em>corps</em> as <em>Körper</em> or “body.”
        Indeed, this policy seems most true to the original term and its
        polysemic qualities. Moreover, sticking to body terminology invokes the
        living, changing nature of materials and the corporeal dimensions of
        working (with) the <em>corps</em> of materials in an artisanal context.

        Conclusion: <em>Corps</em> as a Linguistic Strategy to Navigate
        “Ineffable” Domains</h2>
    <p>Considering the rich and varied connotations discussed above and the
        semantic spectrum the term <em>corps</em> covers, conceptualizing a
        material’s <em>corps</em> appears to have mattered to the writer and
        maker of the exceptionally detailed document of artisanal know-how that
        is Ms. Fr. 640. Through attentive reading of the handwritten folios and
        by executing experimental reconstructions of casting, color, and varnish
        recipes, we could observe how efficiently the author-practitioner worked
        with <em>corps</em> in practice and on paper. As a linguistic tool or
        strategy, <em>corps</em> allowed him to express specific phenomena that
        were key to mastering artisanal procedures otherwise difficult to
        express in words. After working ourselves through the <em>corps</em>
        recipes, we come to the conclusion that the author-practitioner’s use of
        this concept allowed him to successfully navigate “ineffable” domains of
        artisanal practice. His conceptualization and use of <em>corps</em> can
        best be understood when we describe the concept in its different
        contexts of use and define it dynamically as a linguistic strategy,
        rather than trying to provide a concise definition of the meaning of
        <em>corps</em> in early modern artisanal discourse. With this focus on
        semantic richness and the creative strategies speakers (and writers, in
        our case) use to express themselves, we followed the approach of
        linguistic anthropologists and argued against a tendency in scholarship
        on craftsmanship to emphasize only the shortcomings and impossibilities
        of spoken and written language to voice the idiosyncratic experiential
        and material phenomena of craft practices.</p>
    <p>The lively and detailed descriptions of the sensory experiences of the
        author-practitioner furthermore demonstrate how his use of the term
        <em>corps</em> was grounded in the skilled vision and trained touch of
        an experienced practitioner. Building on Pamela Smith’s work, our
        discussion of <em>corps</em> reveals what we could tentatively call an
        artisanal corpuscular epistemology, i.e., an emergent conceptualization
        of <em>corps</em> as a technical term to describe manual modifications
        and transformative processes of materials through an intimately
        entangled practice of making, knowing, and writing.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Our comparison between Ms. Fr. 640 and Ms. Sloane 2052 strongly suggests
        that <em>corps</em> terminology in art technological writings belonged
        to a more widely shared corpuscular discourse in premodern arts and
        crafts. Perhaps further research will reveal etymological connections
        between early modern <em>corps</em> language and current technical
        terminology in color writing, like the German “Farbkörper,” employed by
        Berger and still in use today. De Mayerne’s recipe trials and
        observations, though dated slightly later, provide an interesting
        comparison on account of the close bodily proximity of writer and
        workshop. We can discern in De Mayerne’s notes on color and varnish
        making a similar broad semantic spectrum for <em>corps</em> with a
        conspicuous variety and fluidity of meaning<em>,</em> indicating
        material characteristics related to consistency and transparency.
        Finally, both the author-practitioner of Ms. Fr. 640 and De Mayerne
        testify in their writings to their roles as close observers of
        contemporary artisanal practices and as hands-on experimenters.</p>
    <p>In addition to evidence that the polysemic qualities were recognized and
        used in art technological sources, a quick excursion to contemporary
        dictionaries leads to a puzzling observation. Although bilingual
        dictionaries such as those by Cotgrave (1611) and d’Arsy (1633) include
        the term <em>corps</em>, they do not necessarily show awareness of the
        uses of the term as we described them above. D’Arsy’s French–Dutch
        dictionary translates <em>corps</em> only as a physical body, either
        human or natural (e.g., “le corps d’un arbre”), and as an assembly of
        people (“compagnie de gens”); it also includes the term in the context
        of “body and soul” (<em>corps &amp; coeur</em>).<a href="#fn65"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref65"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>65</sup></a> Cotgrave gives as the primary
        meaning “a bodie, a corps,” but follows with terms more closely related
        to material quality: “the whole bulk, or substance of; also, a volume
        ... also, (in cloth, or stuffe) substance, tacke, stuffinesse.”<a
           href="#fn66"

           role="doc-noteref"><sup>66</sup></a> No description of <em>corps</em>
        as a quality of a material is included. Godefroy’s <em>Dictionnaire de
            l’ancienne langue française et de tous ses dialects du IXe au XVe
            siècle</em> includes several terms that have corp* as their basis
        (e.g., <em>corpuleux – en parlant de chose, volumineux, corpora – qui a
            un corps</em>), but also only documents the use of the term
        <em>corps</em> as <em>le corps d’un object</em> (“the body of an
        object”) in French language from this period.<a href="#fn67"
           class="footnote-ref"

           role="doc-noteref"><sup>67</sup></a> A rare early reference to the
        modification of <em>corps</em> is found only in the 1606 French–Latin
        dictionary <em>Trésor de la langue françois tant ancienne que
            modern</em>, which includes <em>prendre du corps</em> in the
        <em>corps</em> entry.<a href="#fn68"

        above dictionaries relate <em>corps</em> to opacity or lack thereof,
        while this essay has demonstrated that this connotation was common
        knowledge to both the author-practitioner and contemporary
        practitioners. It is surprising that the wide-ranging and interesting
        web of meaning for <em>corps</em> which emerges from the artisanal
        sources discussed in this essay is not reflected in contemporary
        dictionaries, which emphasize the structural qualities of <em>corps</em>
        and seem to neglect its implications for transparency. Whether this
        points to a more general discrepancy between early modern artisanal
        vocabulary and the codification of language in contemporary dictionaries
        is still an open question—a topic for further research.<a href="#fn70"

                <p>The author-practitioner probably refers here to sand from the
                    area of Toulouse, see above. As kindly brought to our
                    attention by Colin Debuiche, Toulouse sand had some fame. In
                    his description of the history of Toulouse, <em>Les gestes
                        des Tholosains,</em> ([1515] 1517), Nicolas Bertrand
                    praised the quality of Toulouse sand, which he attributed to
                    the local climate and the positive influence of the planet
                    Mercury on the city. For more on the historical context of
                    Toulouse see Debuiche and Muñoz, “Le Ms. Fr. 640 et le

                <p>Cotgrave gives for “Estaim de glace” a specific kind of tin
                    that is used e.g., “in the tinning of the backsides of
                    Looking-glasses,” which is described as “being of a
                    substance most thinne, small, even, dry, and little subject
                    to giving by any change of weather.” Cotgrave,

                    18r. De Mayerne’s comparison of smoke black to black
                    pigments made from ivory or the bones of sheep feet, has
                    been imprecisely translated by Ernst Berger in his 1901
                    German editions as “Elfenbeinschwarz oder Beinschwarz (von
                    Schafsknochen) ist viel besser, wenigstens bezüglich des
                    Körpers.” Berger, <em>Quellen für Maltechnik</em>, 132. Fels
                    follows Berger in the first English edition from 2004,
                    translating the last sentence verbatim from Berger as:
                    “Ivory black or bone black (from sheep bone) is much better,
                    at least in regard to body.” Fels, <em>Lost Secrets,</em>
                    153. De Mayerne’s positive assessment of ivory black as
                    “having less body” (<em>moings corps</em>) is lost in Fels
                    and Berger’s translation. Also, the translation of “black
                    from smoke” as “soot black” is problematic, as it is more
                    restrictive in meaning than the French phrasing.
                    Interestingly, Ms. Fr. 640 evinces a similar general
                    categorization of colors within artisanal discourse, listing
                    colors that have body and have none; see fols. 58r, 64v,

                    keeps as close as possible to the manuscript and diverges
                    from Berger’s 1901 German translation: “Krepp oder

                    man Weiss so trocken, dass es nirgends Körperhaft deckt und

                        für Maltechnik</em>, 287. See also Fels’s 2004 English
                    edition, which translates from Berger’s German edition
                    rather than from the French manuscript: “CREPE, OR
                    DIAPHANOUS CLOTH. A crepe cloth is done by applying a white
                    so white that it nowhere substantially covers and leaves
                    everything transparante.” Fels, <em>Lost Secrets</em>, 238.
                    In both cases the translators chose, unwisely in our
                    opinion, to substitute <em>corps</em> with other phrasings
                    when translating the French “qu’il ne laisse nul corps.”<a

                    extensive list of the different meanings, which include
                    those described by d’Arsy. Here, we find the following
                    description, which seems to overlap in part with the use of
                    <em>corps</em> by the author-practitioner: “Corps, se dit
                    aussi des choses qui ont plus de force, de consistence, de
                    solidité que d’autres qui ne laissent pas d’être
                    corporelles. Les étoffes qui ont bien du corps durent plus
                    que les autres. Un papier qui n’a gueres de corps est suject
                    à boire. Les vins qui ont bien du corps se gardent sur
                    l’arriere-saison<em>.</em>” (“<em>Corps</em>, is also said
                    of things that have more strength, consistency, solidity
                    than others that do not appear corporal. Fabrics that have
                    <em>bien de corps</em> last longer than others. A papier
                    that has no <em>corps</em> is subject to absorbing. Wines
                    that have a good <em>corps</em> are kept until the late

                    includes the following definition, within an entry on
                    <em>corps</em> that stretches over more than five densely
                    filled columns on two pages: “Corps, se dit aussi en parlant
                    de la solidité &amp; de l’épaisseur de certaines choses qui
                    sont ordinairement un peu minces. Ce parchemin, ce papier

                    is also used when talking about the solidity &amp; the
                    thickness of certain things that are ordinarily a little
                    thin. This parchment, this paper has no <em>corps</em>, has
