        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <div>
            <p>One of many recipes in BnF Ms. Fr. 640 devoted to making sand
                molds for metal casting, “Sand of burnt ox bones and rock salt”
                on fol. <a
                   href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/89r/f/89r/tl"><u>89r</u></a>
                contains only two components: “burnt ox bone” and rock salt.
                Most sand mold recipes contain a dry and a wet component, but
                this one specifies two dry components. This essay discusses
                sands and binders, solves the puzzle of how two dry molding
                components create a successful bond in the sand, and concludes
                by discussing the experiential and conceptual categories of fat
                and lean in the author-practitioner’s material imaginary.</p>

    <p>This recipe on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/89r/f/89r/tl"><u>89r</u></a>
        “Sand of burnt ox bones and rock salt” describes a “sand”
        (<em>sable</em>) to be used for making molds. This sand has only two
        components: “burnt ox bone” and rock salt, which are to be pulverized
        and mixed, then “moistened [...] in paper, folded in a wet napkin, which
        is previously made in the <em>serain</em> of the night or in the
        moisture of the cellar.” The resulting sand, according to the
        author-practitioner, is good for casting tin or lead. Many recipes in
        BnF Ms. Fr. 640 are devoted to making sand for molds suitable for
        casting metals. Most of these recipes contain a dry and a wet component.
        The dry component is the “sand,” and the wet component is the binder
        that holds the sand together. For example, on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/84v/f/84v/tl"><u>84v</u></a>,
        the recipe includes burnt bone of ox foot and a broth of elm root.<a

           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref1"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> And on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/118v/f/118v/tl"><u>118v</u></a>,
        the sand is a powder of plaster, brick, and feather alum, and the wet
        binder is sal ammoniac, water, and wine.<a href="#fn2"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref2"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> The recipe on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/89r/f/89r/tl"><u>89r</u></a>,
        however, contains two dry components.</p>
    <p>Other sixteenth-century authors also list various materials used as sand.
        According to Biringuccio, sand is usually composed of powders “made of
        crushed brick, tripoli, vine ashes, tiles, and glazed drain pipes, or
        burned emery, calcined tin, straw, and of burned paper and horse dung as
        well as of young ram’s horn ashes and many other things,” and the binder
        is usually a “magistry of salt.”<a href="#fn3"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref3"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> Good sand should be finely ground
        and take the metal well, and the binder should make the sand strong and
        hold together when the mold is dried.<a href="#fn4"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref4"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> Based on a comparison of the
        recipe on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/89r/f/89r/tl"><u>89r</u></a>
        with other recipes in Ms. Fr. 640 and in Biringuccio’s
        <em>Pirotechnia</em>, the sand detailed on fol. 89r seems unusual
        because of the absence of an obvious wet binder other than the “moisture
        of the cellar.” This recipe raised other questions as well: What is
        powder of ox bone, and how is it made? Can the powder of ox bone and
        rock salt bind together without a liquid binder? If not, what serves as
        the binder? How fine must the powder be, and how is that achieved?
        Additionally, the author-practitioner notes that “The bone of the foot
        of oxen is always so lean on its own that, without being mixed with one
        or two parts of some fatty sand &amp; one that has bond, such as
        tripoli, salts, felt, ashes &amp; similar things, it would not release
        &amp; would not mold neatly, for it crumbles.” What is the meaning of
        “fatty sand?” These questions impelled our reconstruction of this
        recipe.</p>
    <p>This essay first treats the two components in this recipe—ox bone and
        rock salt—and their preparation methods, then it turns to the question
        of what serves as the binder in this recipe, and it concludes with a
        discussion of the experiential and conceptual categories of fat and
        lean. As will become clear, our reconstruction process provided answers
        to the questions raised by this seemingly implausible sand, and it gave
        many insights into the author-practitioner’s material imaginary.<a

    <p>Fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/89r/f/89r/tl"><u>89r</u></a>
        does not give any information about the production of the powder of
        burnt ox bones, but clues appear in other recipes in Ms. Fr. 640, for
        example, on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/67v/f/67v/tl"><u>67v</u></a>,
        a recipe, “Bones of the foot of oxen for sand,” mentions the bone is
        “burned well twice &amp; pulverized,” and on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/69r/f/69r/tl"><u>69r</u></a>–<a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/69v/f/69v/tl"><u>v</u></a>,
        the recipe for “Sand” again mentions “Sand from oxen feet, burned twice
        &amp; finely ground.” These statements informed our conclusion that the
        powder of ox bone is produced by calcining and grinding ox bones into
        bone ash.</p>
    <p>Bone ash seems to have been a common material for sand casting.<a
           href="#fn6"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref6"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> In addition to the recipe on fol.
        <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/89r/f/89r/tl"><u>89r</u></a>,
        the author-practitioner also mentions the use of bone ash on fols. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/67v/f/67v/tl"><u>67v</u></a>,
        <a

           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/69v/f/69v/tl"><u>v</u></a>,
        and <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/84v/f/84v/tl"><u>84v</u></a>–<a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/85r/f/85r/tl"><u>85r</u></a>.
        The author-practitioner seems to regard bone ash as an ideal material
        for casting because he claims that it enables easy removal of the cast
        objects from the mold: on fol. 67v, he states that “bones of foot of
        oxen,” form “the neatest sand that can be found for copper.” In “Sand of
        burnt ox bones and rock salt” on fol. 89r, he notes that</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>I have not found anything else which releases more neatly than this
            one. It wants to be rather humid. And if you want to cast very thin,
            make sure it is very hot. It came out very neatly in soft tin, like
            the principal [i.e., the pattern], and withstood several casts. For
            tin, I believe that it is not necessary to seek a better one, nor
            for fine lead either, which comes out almost as neatly as tin.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>Our reconstruction confirmed that bone ash
        and rock salt molds do take tin well and can be removed cleanly, while,
        in contrast, cast sulfur objects cannot be removed cleanly from molds
        made according to fol. 89r.</p>
    <p>The source of bone ash, according to fols. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/67v/f/67v/tl"><u>67v</u></a>
        and <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/89r/f/89r/tl"><u>89r</u></a>,
        should be the “bone of the foot of oxen.” This refers to the digital
        bones including proximal phalanx, middle phalanx, distal phalanx (coffin
        bone), proximal sesamoid bones, and distal sesamoid (navicular) bone (<i><u>Fig. 1</u></i>). Contemporary sources point to other kinds of bone
        used for bone ash: Biringuccio, for example, mentions ash made of young
        ram’s horn, leg bones of horses, donkeys, and mules.<a href="#fn7"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref7"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> In a recipe for sand stretching
        from fol. 69r through 70v, the author-practitioner states on fol. <a

        that “sheep foot bones are even better than those of oxen foot,” and
        “human bones are the best for casting once calcined.” Because the
        author-practitioner chose ox foot bone so often, we sought out the same,
        however, we could not obtain ox bones, and instead settled for bovine
        foot bone and calf leg bone for our reconstruction, which we purchased
        from a kosher butcher shop.<a href="#fn8"

           role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> On comparing the bone in the foot

        source of bone ash (<i><u>Fig. 2</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 3</u></i>).</p>

    <p>The process for calcination is not described in the manuscript: the
        author-practitioner does not give any information about the temperature
        and time needed for this process in those recipes that mention burnt
        bones. Other recipes from the same period are similarly opaque about the
        process. For example, fourteenth-century painter Cennino Cennini
        describes the production of bone ash from chicken bones for panel
        paintings: “put them into the fire; and when you see that they have
        turned whiter than ashes, draw them out, and grind them well on the
        porphyry.” <a href="#fn9"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref9"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> Biringuccio mentions using a
        furnace to calcine the bone and then pound and sift the bone ash, but he
        does not provide any information about time or temperature. The absence
        of descriptions of calcination suggests that the knowledge about this
        process was common in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Cennini
        uses burnt and pulverized bone ash for preparing a ground layer for
        panel paintings,<a href="#fn10"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref10"

        (752°F) and then turn gray between 450°C (842°F) and 600°C (1112°F). At
        650°C (1202°F), the bones become white.<a href="#fn16"

        lowest temperature that would result in calcination.</p>
    <p>We prepared the cow’s foot bones for calcination by boiling them for 104
        minutes (<i><u>Fig. 4</u></i>). We removed the remaining skin,
        cartilage, and other soft tissues from the bone using knives and
        brushes. Then we put the cleaned bone in the oven to dry at 200°F (93°C)
        for 1.5 hours and 300°F (149°C) for five hours. For the sake of
        comparison, we also prepared the leg bones in the same manner. However,
        the heads of the leg bones became spongy and soft after boiling, and
        turned gray after being dried in the oven. The foot bone turned white
        and hard after being dried in the oven, and its pieces rang like
        porcelain when tapped (<i><u>Vid. 1</u></i>). Since the foot bone was
        cleaner and denser than the leg bone, we consider the foot bone—as
        stipulated in the manuscript—to be a better source of bone ash.</p>

    <p>We calcined the foot bone in an electronic ceramic kiln (Paragon Dragon
        kiln) (<i><u>Fig. 5</u></i>). We increased the temperature at a rate of
        1100°F (593°C) per hour to 400°F (204°C), then held the temperature at
        400°F (204°C) for 30 minutes, after which we increased the temperature
        at a rate of 1100°F (593°C) per hour to 1500°F (816°C) and held it there
        for 60 minutes. At around 692 °F (367°C), much smoke issued from the
        kiln, changing color from white to black, and then from black to gray
        and to white. At around 800°F (427°C) a gust of smoke again issued from
        the kiln, but by 834°F (427°C) the smoke had almost disappeared. This
        suggests that the organic components in the bone started to burn above
        800°F. Upon opening the kiln, we found the bones had become extremely
        white, with only some gray parts remaining. These white bones were easy
        to grind in the mortar. When we ground the bone, we found some bones had
        a black layer inside of them, although their surface was completely
        white. This suggests that the bone was not completely calcined and still
        had some organic components. Overall, the ground bone ash felt like fine
        sand and was a grayish color. For comparison, we also purchased
        commercial bone ash, which is calcined using modern industrial methods,
        with the result that it is extremely white and fine, and looks and feels
        like flour.</p>

    <p>The physical characteristics of the bone ash that we made in the
        kiln—fine and powdery—correspond to the author-practitioner’s
        description of the powder of ox bone. The author-practitioner pointed
        out that the ash of ox foot bones is dry and crumbles if not mixed with
        fatty sand. On fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/84v/f/84v/tl"><u>84v</u></a>,
        the author-practitioner mentions that ox foot bone “on its own it is
        very arid &amp; lean, it wants to be well moistened &amp; dampened with
        wine boiled with elm root.” We can thereby deduce that the ox foot bone
        ash is too dry a substance to bind together by itself.</p>
    <h2 id="rock-salt">Rock Salt</h2>
    <p>Rock salt is the mineral form of sodium chloride (NaCl). It is mined in
        mountains, for example, one major salt mine is located in Berchtesgaden
        in Rheinberg, Bavaria. Biringuccio states that it is “made by Nature in
        the form of stone,”<a href="#fn17"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref17"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> and he viewed Hungary as an
        abundant source of rock salt.<a href="#fn18"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref18"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> Although the color of rock salt
        varies in each mine, the main component, sodium chloride, is the same.
        Because it was easily available, we chose Himalayan salt from the Khewra
        Salt Mine in Pakistan for our experiment (<i><u>Fig. 6</u></i>). The
        chemical composition of Himalayan salt includes 95–96% sodium chloride
        and iron oxide, which gives the salt a pink color.</p>

    <h2 id="what-is-the-binder">What is the Binder?</h2>
    <p>“Sand of burnt ox bones and rock salt” on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/89r/f/89r/tl"><u>89r</u></a>
        stands in contrast to other recipes for sand casting because no liquid
        binder or <em>magistra</em><a href="#fn19"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref19"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a> is mentioned. Instead the
        author-practitioner instructs the reader to place the sand made from
        bone ash and rock salt “moistened [...] in paper, folded in a wet
        napkin, which is previously made in the <em>serain</em> of the night or
        in the moisture of the cellar.” On fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/88v/f/88v/tl"><u>88v</u></a>,
        the author-practitioner uses a similar method to moisten sand containing
        rock salt: “put them on a marble in a cellar. In one night, they had
        been moistened enough by themselves without dampening them further.”
        Thus we can see that in recipes which use ground rock salt as part of
        the sand, the author-practitioner advises moistening it in the air or
        paper instead of directly adding liquid into the sand. Insight into this
        technique comes on fol. 88v, where the author-practitioner states that
        “rock salt, like all other salts, dissolves in the damp.” Our
        reconstruction sought to replicate the cool moisture of the night and/or
        cellar by using a specially constructed humidifier to both imitate and
        accelerate this process. We enveloped our “sand” in a damp piece of
        paper, laid it on a glazed ceramic plate, then wrapped it in a piece of
        linen, wet it with just enough water that it no longer dripped. (<i><u>Fig. 7</u></i> and <i><u>Fig. 8</u></i>). Then we put the plate
        on an improvised open grill shelf system so that it could receive the
        steady stream of cool moist air from a cold vapor humidifier below (<i><u>Fig. 9</u></i>).</p>

    <p>The author-practitioner did not specify the type of material from which
        the paper and napkin were made. In the early modern period, cotton was a
        luxury item from Asia, and household textiles were commonly made from
        hemp or linen; thus we used a 100% linen cloth for the napkin. Early
        modern paper was made from rags that contained raw flax and hemp
        fibers,<a href="#fn20"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref20"

        is specified when the author-practitioner writes, “I mixed as much of

        binds with humidity from the air. This raises the question of which
        ingredient acts as the binder.</p>
    <p>We knew that the bone ash could not be the binder because it is too dry
        and crumbly. Interestingly, in Ms. Fr. 640, rock salt is used both in
        liquid and solid form in making molds. On fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/84r/f/84r/tl"><u>84r</u></a>,
        dissolved rock salt is an ingredient in the <em>magistra</em>, or liquid
        binder, which the author-practitioner notes “will give it a bond to
        withstand several castings.” On fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/89r/f/89r/tl"><u>89r</u></a>,
        he mixes dry salt and calcined ox bones, and on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/88v/f/88v/tl"><u>88v</u></a>,
        he mixes dry rock salt and quarry sand and dampens them with water. Both
        these methods were said to create durable molds, which the
        author-practitioner also clearly stated on fol. 89v in a recipe for sand
        made from sal ammoniac and alabaster powder: “There is no better bond
        than salts appropriate for metals, for once mixed in powder, they get
        moistened together &amp; dry &amp; reheat together.”</p>
    <p>We concluded that it is the combination of rock salt and water that binds
        the sand. Without salt, water holds the damp sand together by its
        viscosity and hydrogen bonding. But when the water evaporates, the sand
        falls apart again into grains because there is nothing to hold the
        grains together. But, by adding salt to the sand, as the water
        evaporates, the salt begins to crystallize. The main content of rock
        salt, sodium chloride (NaCl), forms hydrohalite (NaCl • 2H<sub>2</sub>
        O), and develops an elongated crystal structure during the
        crystallization process.<a href="#fn25"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref25"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a> The salt crystallized around the
        grains of sand holds the mold together.<a href="#fn26"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref26"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a> And, indeed, our molds made from
        rock salt and bone ash became very hard and durable when dried.</p>
    <p>We tested the effect of grinding the sand after the moistening process.
        Because the binder created by rock salt and moisture formed crystals, we
        had to regrind the sand after moistening in order to get rid of coarse
        grains before molding with it. By regrinding, we also mixed the bone ash
        and the rock salt more thoroughly. Mold 1, made with once-ground
        homemade sand, left a rough surface on the cast, suggesting that
        regrinding is necessary (<i><u>Fig. 13</u></i>). In comparing the casts
        from Mold 2 (commercial sand) and Mold 6 (homemade sand), we found that
        the commercial sand created a sharper and more detailed cast (<i><u>Fig. 14</u></i>). The eagle’s feathers and the letters came out more
        sharply in Mold 6 (<i><u>Fig. 15</u></i>) than in Mold 2. This suggests
        that the finer the sand, the better and more detailed the resulting
        cast. Therefore we can say that the regrinding process has at least
        three effects: first, to mix the bone ash and rock salt well; second, to
        make the sand finer so that the cast is more detailed; and third, to
        break down the clumps in the sand and enable the rock salt to
        crystallize more evenly.</p>

    <p>We tested brandy and charcoal powder as separating agents, as instructed
        by the manuscript, to keep the pattern from adhering to the sand. Brandy
        had little effect. In contrast, charcoal powder was effective in

    <h2 id="what-is-fatty-sand-the-categories-of-fat-and-lean">What is Fatty
        Sand? The Categories of Fat and Lean</h2>
    <p>Where we attribute the binding power of this sand of calcined bovine foot
        bones and rock salt to the slow crystallization of the salt, the
        author-practitioner attributed it to the fatty nature of the salt,
        writing, “The bone of the foot of oxen is always so lean on its own
        that, without being mixed with one or two parts of some fatty sand &amp;
        one that has bond” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/89r/f/89r/tl"><u>89r</u></a>).
        On fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/89v/f/89v/tl"><u>89v</u></a>,
        he notes that another frequently used binder, sal ammoniac, is also
        fatty. The terms “fat” (<em>gras</em>) and “lean” (<em>maigre</em>)
        appear in many entries in Ms. Fr. 640.</p>
    <h3 id="clays">Clays</h3>
    <p>We get a sense of what characterizes “fatty” materials in the
        author-practitioner’s notes about clays, for example, in his
        instructions about the right type of clay to choose to make the mold
        walls in plaster molds: “Clay... should be very fatty &amp; handleable
        .... one ought only to choose the quite fatty kind, and beat very well,
        &amp; moisten it moderately with some water” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/108v/f/108v/tl"><u>108v</u></a>).
        Clay is in fact named as “fatty earth” (<em>terre grasse appellee
            ardille</em>) (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/112v/f/112v/tl"><u>112v</u></a>).
        The clay-like substance, Armenian bole, is also viewed as fatty, indeed
        as excessively so: “Finely sieved brick is better, because the bole is
        too fatty” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/12v/f/12v/tl"><u>12v</u></a>)
        Clays are used by tanners and fullers, and the artisan who makes sheaths
        for swords uses “small, very delicate skins of lambs and young goats,
        almost like parchment ...When they want to imprint some history, they
        layer them in the hollows of their figure, then put over the top fine
        fatty earth with which cloths are rid of grease [i.e., fuller’s earth]”
        (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/57v/f/57v/tl"><u>57v</u></a>).
        On fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/12r/f/12r/tl"><u>12r</u></a>,
        we hear that this material is known as “<em>terre chimolée</em>,
        otherwise known as fuller’s earth, with which they dress the cloth, is
        excellent for molding hollow or in relief; &amp; if you want to reheat
        it, it must first be warm, &amp; reheat it on a gentle fire at a
        distance &amp; little by little, otherwise it would crack.... It is very
        soft, neat &amp; beautiful.”</p>
    <p>The utility of clay or “fatty earth” for metalworkers, and, in
        particular, for founders, is made clear on fols. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/77r/f/77r/tl"><u>77r</u></a>
        and <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/41r/f/41r/tl"><u>41r</u></a>
        in “Fatty earth” (<em>Terre graisse</em>): “Founders, to make the
        handles of their bells, use it. And before it is used, they beat it very
        well, then leave it to dry in the shade, little by little &amp; for a
        long time, and mold with it very neatly. But it must not be sandy <del>
            &amp;</del>, but rather well chosen &amp; soft” (fol. 77r). Further
        characteristics of this fatty earth that are useful to founders are
        revealed on fol. 41r:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Earth for casting, for founders</p>
        <p>It renders itself fatty once beaten and also mixed with horse dung.
            Potter’s earth would be too fatty and would crack &amp; would not
            hold in the fire, but one needs to mix it with half as much sand and
            a quarter or a fifth of <sup>horse</sup> dung. And leave it to dry,
            then turn it to powder, then sift it to render it fine &amp; purged
            of gravel, which would prevent it from casting neatly. The dung
            renders the earth more amenable &amp; easier to deal with, but it is
            necessary that it be well free of straw &amp; other things. And when
            the earth is very fatty, one needs to give it more sand &amp; more
            dung. But one does find fatty earths, in and of themselves mixed
            with sand. If they are not, do it by artifice. One always needs to
            reheat the earths before casting.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>This passage makes clear that the natural
        properties of fatty and lean earths can be transformed by the artifice
        of the metalworker. It also indicates that fatty earths are soft,
        malleable, but also crack more easily on drying, and must be dried
        slowly. This is affirmed on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/165r/f/165r/tl"><u>165r</u></a>
        in an observation about plaster molds: “When it is long to set &amp;
        dry, it is a sign that it is too fatty &amp; moist, which is what makes
        it contract in fire &amp; crack, causing flashing. That which is drawn
        from lean soil is the best. Molds of fatty plaster ought not to be kept
        for a long time, for they act like fatty earth, which when drying by
        itself, cracks.”</p>
    <h3 id="other-fatty-materials">Other Fatty Materials</h3>
    <p>Materials other than clay had the property of fattiness as well,
        including black pitch (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/44v/f/44v/tl"><u>44v</u></a>),
        tallow, especially that “which is fatty &amp; shiny, from the big
        kitchens” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/93r/f/93r/tl"><u>93r</u></a>),
        feather alum (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/107v/f/107v/tl"><u>107v</u></a>),
        and sugar (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/126r/f/126r/tl"><u>126r</u></a>).
        Interestingly, the author-practitioner states that “Sugar is fatty
        <sup>when runny and brittle &amp; breakable when dry</sup>” and,
        additionally, sugar can also be sour &amp; brittle (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/126r/f/126r/tl"><u>126r</u></a>).
        Lye, when new, is not “fatty” and can be used to degrease objects cast
        from tin (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/157r/f/157r/tl"><u>157r</u></a>).
        Pots and mortars used for heating or grinding certain materials can turn
        “fatty” and ruin good fish glue (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/159r/f/159r/tl"><u>159r</u></a>).
    </p>
    <h3 id="varnishes-and-colors">Varnishes and Colors</h3>
    <p>Varnishes can also be fatty, for example, on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/3v/f/3v/tl"><u>3v</u></a>,
        in “For varnishing:” “Turpentine varnish does not need any glue because
        it is fatty &amp; viscous &amp; it is not absorbed in the wood.” On fol.
        <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/4r/f/4r/tl"><u>4r</u></a>,
        in “Varnish of spike lavender oil,” “the sandarac is well melted, which
        you will know by taking a little of the said varnish on a plate, and if
        it is fatty when you handle it with a finger, it is ready.” Fattiness is
        also a factor in gilding, for example, on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/6r/f/6r/tl"><u>6r</u></a>,
        where we learn that “Ceruse &amp; lead white is not appropriate for
        polished white nor for burnishing because it is fatty, but it is quite
        good for <em>or mat</em> which is made with oil.” Indeed, in discussing
        fatty oil in connection with gilding and painting, we learn quite a lot
        about the properties of fatty materials: “take only fatty oil, which is
        made in seven or eight days in the sun with walnut oil and lead white
        <del>&amp; with</del>, stirring it often, or cooking it on the fire if
        one is in haste” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/7r/f/7r/tl"><u>7r</u></a>).<a
           href="#fn28"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref28"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a> In the entry on “Fatty oil”
        (<em>Huile gras</em>), we learn that it “is not good for working with
        colors because it makes them thick, &amp; as difficult to work as
        <em>azur d’esmail</em>. Therefore use the clearest walnut oil that you
        can, &amp; the freshest.” Some colors, however, need fat to give them
        body: “The azure requires a little fatty oil because it has no body”
        (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/58v/f/58v/tl"><u>58v</u></a>).
    </p>
    <p>Indeed, gold colors, including mordant gilding, are made successfully
        from “fatty colors:” “All fatty colors, such as ceruse and minium,
        massicot, ocher, lead white, are good for making gold color” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/65r/f/65r/tl"><u>65r</u></a>),
        and again on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/100r/f/100r/tl"><u>100r</u></a>,
        in an entry on quickly making a “Gold color,” starts by producing a
        “fatty walnut oil in the sun or on the fire, as said above, for it
        thickens by itself in this way, although there is neither lead nor
        ceruse.”</p>
    <p>On fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/60r/f/60r/tl"><u>60r</u></a>,
        we learn that oil needs to have a little “body,” which, as we have seen
        above, is created by exposing the oil to the heat and light of the sun,
        or by adding lead, by heating it, or by adding calcined pulverized
        glass.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Walnut oil extracted like peeled almonds is very white. The one of
            palma christi. And when the oil has a little body, the colors soften
            in it. For if the oil is too clear, the colors run &amp; do not have
            bond, even those that hardly have any body. Fatty oil that is not
            easily imbibed is appropriate for varnish. The oil is desiccative
            enough when it dries out as quickly as common varnish. Oils do not
            dry as quickly in cold countries as in hot countries. Oil exposed to
            the sun is clarified well. But it fattens, if you put in ceruse or
            lead filings or lead white or calcined pulverized <em>
                <del>p</del>
            </em>glass.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>Oil should not, however, have too much
        body or fattiness, and “To avoid this, put the vial [of oil] in clear
        water,” presumably to keep the sun from affecting it (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/60r/f/60r/tl"><u>60r</u></a>).
        In painting in distemper (e.g., glue and pigment), “All colors that have
        no body in oil have none in distemper, <del>and</del> but in distemper
        they sink to the bottom. Distemper colors want to be fatty, which is
        recognized when they take hold on the palette once tempered in oil”
        (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/64v/f/64v/tl"><u>64v</u></a>).
    </p>
    <p>If we tally up these characteristics of “fatty” so far, we have
        “handleable,” malleability, softness, moistness to the point of
        liquidity (such as in the sugar example: “Sugar is fatty <sup>when runny
            and brittle &amp; breakable when dry</sup>”, fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/126r/f/126r/tl"><u>126r</u></a>).
        This liquidity can be contrasted to dryness, and fatty things must be
        carefully dried because they crack easily. Fattiness also gives body or
        substance to colors, is especially useful in gold colors, and is
        associated with lead and lead-based pigments, but renders hard-to-work
        materials, such as <em>azur d’esmail</em> (here probably meaning a
        pigment made of blue glass), even more difficult.</p>
    <p>The visual appearance of fattiness is indicated on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/10r/f/10r/tl"><u>10r</u></a>
        in the recipe for “Counterfeit Jasper,” in which the “horn presents a
        luster &amp; fatty polish like jasper.” In this process, the
        author-practitioner seeks to imitate the lustrous, silky “fatty polish”
        of jasper by using horn. Fattiness is also characterized by
        slipperiness: in “For diamond points for engraving,” “when these points
        are fatty &amp; cannot bite, one needs to rub them diamond against
        diamond” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/11v/f/11v/tl"><u>11v</u></a>).
        The slipperiness of the diamond points means that they do not get
        traction and bite the engraving plate. More clarity on these nature of
        fattiness as sticky or slippery is found in entries to do with lead as a
        metal used in actions of cutting, filing, and chasing: in “Cleaning
        files,” the author-practitioner notes that “Sometimes they are fattened,
        &amp; by means of the grease, the lead, which is fatty in itself, or
        other filings, attach to it. And you will be able to clean them either
        with hot charcoal or a scratch brush made of wires of latten” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/159v/f/159v/tl"><u>159v</u></a>).
        In “Cutting lead,” because the lead “is fatty &amp; grips &amp; sticks
        to the knife or chisel, wet it &amp; you will cut it like glass” (fol.
        <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/154r/f/154r/tl"><u>154r</u></a>).
        Here a fatty stickiness is resolved by wetting the material. In chasing
        (i.e., afterwork to an object after casting), “Lead is so fatty &amp;
        soft that one cannot strike it boldly, &amp; one needs to have a very
        light hand. The other great metals [i.e., the nobler metals] are easier”
        (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/156r/f/156r/tl"><u>156r</u></a>).
    </p>
    <p>Taking these passages all together, we can see that the property of
        fattiness is homologous with fat itself: shiny, moist, slippery,
        malleable, but also sticky (which can be remedied by wetting with
        water), easily transformed to a runny liquid, tending to viscous
        especially when mixed with some materials, slow of drying, and prone to
        cracking.</p>
    <h3 id="fatty-sand">Fatty Sand</h3>
    <p>It is in the sand recipes, however, that the meaning, properties, and
        utility, as well as the means of transforming the fattiness by artifice
        come into sharper focus. Some sands are naturally fatty: “Sand from <em>
            <del>corp</del>
        </em> rock is always better, which seems like <em>tuf</em> in lumps,
        which has a beautiful &amp; very fine grain, &amp; a little fatty” (fol.
        <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/70r/f/70r/tl"><u>70r</u></a>).
        Too much fattiness can render the sand unfit for casting because it can
        destroy its bonding capacity: “Thoroughly burnt sand loses its bond.
        Slate is reheated &amp; molds neatly. Next, it is true that it often
        becomes porous, as burned earth also does, as fatty sand also does”
        (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/87v/f/87v/tl"><u>87v</u></a>).
        If sand is “too fatty, one ought to reheat it and sieve it again” (fol.
        <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/82v/f/82v/tl"><u>82v</u></a>).
        Good molding and casting sands must be sought out carefully; the
        author-practitioner tells us what to look for:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Sand</p>
        <p>You should not choose for casting the one that is in any way so lean
            &amp; arid that it does not have bond, like the one from the sea or
            <em>
                <del>desei</del>
            </em> from sandy paths dried out by the sun. But <sup>choose</sup>
            them <del>or in <em>t</em></del> in the first place from quar<em>
                <del>reries</del>
            </em>ries or rock caves, because that one is best, provided that it
            is very fine. You will recognize the vein of it if, among the
            greyish rocks or quarries <em>
                <del>qu</del>
            </em> that seem to be made of <em>arene</em>, you see, after rainy
            weather, certain small patches like dust attached to the said rocks,
            or if due to the humidity, a small piece of it flakes off, which
            easily crushes between your hands. You will also find in lean soils
            some which comes off in <em>
                <del>lop</del>
            </em> large lumps like stones of <em>tuf</em> <em>
                <del>et ne</del>
            </em>, or among <em>terres bolvenes</em>, which are much better than
            those in fatty &amp; strong earths. And one ought not to take it
            from the surface, for fear that it be mixed with common earth, but
            three or 4 feet below &amp; the closest to the <em>tuf</em> or
            stone. Since it comes out in large lumps one would say that it
            starts to take shape as a stone. But when it is wet, it comes apart
            easily. One needs to make sure that when breaking it up it is quite
            granular, &amp; that when crushed between the fingers, it renders
            itself into very great subtlety, <del>like impalpable</del>, keeping
            nevertheless its sandy asperity, without muddying the fingers like
            clay. It is dried slightly on the <em>
                <del>[illegible]</del>
            </em> fire, then it is pestled &amp; passed finely through a double
            sieve or a linen sleeve, then is moistened with wine or
            <em>magistra</em> &amp;c (fol. <a
               href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/69r/f/69r/tl"><u>69r</u></a>).
        </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>Excellent sand can also be made by the
        artisan:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>It is necessary that lean sands be more moistened than others, namely
            with <em>magistra</em> or good pure wine or boiled wine with elm
            tree roots &amp; similar things. But very fine sands, like burned
            linen, which is fatty &amp; soft on its own, want to be applied dry
            (fol. <a
               href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/69v/f/69v/tl"><u>69v</u></a>).
        </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>Some molders, like those from Foix, “make
        their sand with <em>crocum</em> &amp; calcined slate, but slate always
        retains its asperity &amp; becomes porous, because it is fatty [....]
        They sieve their sand, grind it on porphyry, and wet it in water, &amp;
        they take away the finest, which is on top, then reheat it” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/143r/f/143r/tl"><u>143r</u></a>).
    </p>
    <p>The author-practitioner engaged in intensive experimentation with sands
        in order to find the correct mix of lean and fat:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>The sand <del>cast</del> for casting should be chosen neither so lean
            that it has no hold, nor too fatty. And although it is found in
            nature, it is nonetheless not everywhere. And if you are in a place
            where it is not found, you can make it, but not with fatty earth,
            for the sand does not want it at all, for it makes it very porous.
            But you can give it bond with brick thoroughly ground on marble, or
            plaster or calcined alabaster or something similar, or the burned
            marrow of ox horn or burned <em>aspalte</em> throughout. If you
            grind it quite finely on porphyry, it <em>
                <del>s</del>
            </em> acquires hold &amp; then you can burn it with <em>aspalte</em>
            or mix it with a quarter part of tripoli. Guard against bread
            falling into your sand because it makes it very porous. Try mixing
            in soot black (fol. <a
               href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/41r/f/41r/tl"><u>41r</u></a>).
        </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>On fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/89v/f/89v/tl"><u>89v</u></a>,
        he emphasizes that color of the sand does not matter, but rather its
        bond and/or its small particle size:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>It does not matter if the color is white or yellow. Above all it must
            be in one piece &amp; as if taken from a quarry or rock formation,
            &amp; the deeper one takes it from, the better. The signs of its
            goodness are that it is thus amassed, and that when removing itself
            in the form of rock, it comes out in lumps &amp; <em>
                <del>qu</del>
            </em> bricks, which demonstrate its bond &amp; that it is not too
            lean. However, it should break apart between your hands &amp; have
            very small <em>
                <del>men</del>
            </em> &amp; delicate grains &amp; of the same nature.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>But, again, he affirms that artifice can
        transform a deficient sand:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>If it is not delicate enough, you can pass &amp; grind it finely,
            either through water or through a sieve <del>&amp; when it</del> or
            on the porphyry, &amp; in this way, from <em>
                <del>sil</del>
            </em> lean they become fatty &amp; well bound. You can mold with it
            in <em>
                <del>sa</del>
            </em> frame or <em>en noyau</em> without cloth waste, &amp; try it
            with lead, for if with this it does not become porous &amp; casts
            neatly, it will also behave well with copper. Some say that the
            fatty sands do not want the metal to be cast too hot. Artisans who
            work in large works &amp;, who for profit, do not need to grind
            &amp; seek the curiosities of artificial sands, benefit more from
            seeking some that is ready-made by nature, which has the finest
            grain possible, &amp; for small works, they only pass it through a
            sieve. But those who work in small works, finely grind it &amp;
            grind it impalpable, because they do not need a lot of it (fol. <a
               href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/89v/f/89v/tl"><u>89v</u></a>).
        </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>And, indeed, he affirms that “any sand can
        be rendered good:”</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Artisans who work in large works &amp; who need to further their
            profit by seeking things already prepared in nature, because she
            does not sell her wares to her children, and to also save the time
            they would use for grinding finely &amp; for artificially preparing
            sands, seek the one of the <em>
                <del>s</del>
            </em> mine<del>s</del>, which is not too fatty, the one that is a
            kin of earth, not too lean &amp; consequently without bond, but
            rather that which is pulled from the depths of the sand-bed in
            bricks &amp; clods that show its natural compaction, which is quite
            difficult to break &amp; which has a very small &amp; delicate
            grain, &amp; which is found soft when handling it between the
            fingers. And because the latter is only found near the rocks in
            mountainous areas or lean territories, &amp; akin to the
            <em>arene</em>, it cannot be found <del>in</del> in the surroundings
            of all the <em>bonnes villes</em> where artisans willingly gather.
            And thus, if they do not have it close to their house, they prefer
            to have it come from afar, like from Lyon, Venice, Paris near the
            Sainct Chappelle &amp; similar places, rather than prepare it.
            However, you can be certain that in all places you can render the
            sand from a mine good &amp; proper for molding. For if it is coarse,
            pass it through a sieve, and if it is not yet fine enough, wash it,
            &amp; when the water has rested a little, empty that which is still
            troubled in some separate vessel. The coarse will promptly fall down
            to the bottom of the first vessel, but the one which will have come
            from the troubled water, set apart, having settled, will be very
            fine. And then, if it does not have enough bond, grind it quite dry
            on porphyry, &amp; you will render it impalpable, &amp; which will
            have bond like chalk. Then, if it seems right to you, you will
            reheat it &amp; again will grind it &amp; mix it with salts, or
            linen, <sup>or</sup> burnt felt, or ashes of paper &amp; similarly
            washed things (fol. <a
               href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/90r/f/90r/tl"><u>90r</u></a>-<a
               href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/90v/f/90v/tl"><u>v</u></a>).
        </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>In order to be used for casting, sands
        need to possess binding capacity, which is created by the addition of
        fatty materials, often salts. These passages reveal, however, that very
        finely ground substances also work to create a bond.</p>
    <h3 id="fatty-metals">Fatty Metals</h3>
    <p>Sands and the metals cast into them operate in a reciprocal relationship
        because metals, too, have fat and lean properties: “lead being fatty
        &amp; weighty, carries more,” thus “one lb of the latter, two ℥ of tin”
        is needed to cast thick things, for if there is too little tin, porosity
        will result (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/131v/f/131v/tl"><u>131v</u></a>).
        When beaten, tin does not crack as easily as lead “although [lead] is
        more fatty,” notes the author-practitioner with surprise (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/159r/f/159r/tl"><u>159r</u></a>).
        Adding lead to silver will make the alloy “fatty” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/164r/f/164r/tl"><u>164r</u></a>).
        Lead’s low melting point makes it easily molten, and it is “ lively
        &amp; runny &amp; liquid” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/131v/f/131v/tl"><u>131v</u></a>),
        while gold is dry and lean (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/153v/f/153v/tl"><u>153v</u></a>).
        Lead and tin can be better molded in stone molds than in copper molds,
        “because copper is fatty &amp; sticks” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/48v/f/48v/tl"><u>48v</u></a>).
        The iron substance, <em>crocum ferri</em>, made from iron filings
        oxidized in vinegar, can work an ameliorative effect on molds: “And when
        your mold is soft &amp; fatty when scraping it with the fingernail, it
        is a sign that the <em>crocum</em> is good, very fine, &amp; well
        prepared” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/132v/f/132v/tl"><u>132v</u></a>).
    </p>
    <p>While seeking a suitable sand for lead, the author-practitioner thinks
        back over his trials:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Since then I have realized that this sand, even though it is
            excellent &amp; endures many castings &amp; molds very neatly,
            nevertheless is fatty and makes things porous. Thus, soft lead <del>
                and the</del> does not come out so well. But try to mix it with
            a lean sand, such as pumice, scales &amp; similar things to give
            them body &amp; so that they release better. For lean sands barely
            release well and yet they receive metal well (fol. <a
               href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/85r/f/85r/tl"><u>85r</u></a>).
        </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>Then, in his account of his “Experimented
        sands,” he has something like an epiphany, even underlining his
        important conclusion in the text:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><u>I find that</u> when a sand is so finely ground that it renders
            itself dense as ceruse &amp; even, <del>like</del> without knowing
            it to be arid, rarefied, sandy &amp; rather spongy, that it molds
            very neatly, but it does not receive metal so well as if it were
            porous to absorb the substance. But rather, once fatty &amp; even,
            it becomes porous &amp; does not receive fine features. I believe
            that the secret to cast well lies in finding a sand that receives
            the metal well, one for lead, the other for another, for each one
            has its particular one (fol. <a
               href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/86r/f/86r/tl"><u>86r</u></a>).

    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>And, on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/84v/f/84v/tl"><u>84v</u></a>,
        he generalizes, “A fatty metal needs lean sand.”<a href="#fn29"

    <p>Fat and lean are also connected in the author-practitioner’s material
        imaginary with another set of qualities—sweet and sour—especially as
        they apply to metals. Sweetness (<em>dous, doulx, doux, douls)</em>
        causes softness and malleability and is associated with purity,
        sonorousness, and newness (i.e., newness in a metal means not being
        reheated many times, e.g., fols. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/48v/f/48v/tl"><u>48v</u></a>,

        associated with brittleness and porosity. These properties in metals can
        be enhanced or ameliorated by the qualities of the sand: “Lead &amp; tin
        come out well in white chalk but the softer [<em>plus doulce</em>] it is
        the better....Note that any brittle [<em>aigre</em>] metal comes out

    <p>Base metals like lead can cause souring (and brittleness): “Goldsmiths do
        not work at all with the silver from reals that is not alloyed, because
        it is leady &amp; when forging it sours” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/154r/f/154r/tl"><u>154r</u></a>).
        Quicksilver (mercury) also sours metals, if left in molds after cleaning
        (fols. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/115r/f/115r/tl"><u>115r</u></a>,
        <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/117v/f/117v/tl"><u>117v</u></a>).
        Sourness causes cracking (as does fattiness), and, in order to sweeten
        silver, the author-practitioner recommends throwing into the well-melted
        silver “some dry mortar composed of sand &amp; good lime which has been
        worked, &amp; pulverize it.” This appears to be an action analogous to
        adding dry, finely ground powder to remedy a fat sand in order to
        prevent porosity and cracking (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/154r/f/154r/tl"><u>154r</u></a>).
    </p>
    <p>Gold is especially sensitive to the presence of the base metals, and can
        be soured by lead and tin in the forge (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/124v/f/124v/tl"><u>124v</u></a>),
        in the mortar (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/128r/f/128r/tl"><u>128r</u></a>)
        and in the crucible, and even by a mold into which these metals have
        been poured (fols. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/108v/f/108v/tl"><u>108v</u></a>,
        <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/119v/f/119v/tl"><u>119v</u></a>).
        Great care must be taken not to bring gold and silver into contact with
        lead, and, if “figures of wax composed of ceruse &amp; lead white” were
        used as models in the mold, the mold should not be employed to “cast
        gold &amp; silver... this would sour it” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/131r/f/131r/tl"><u>131r</u></a>).
        Sweetening the noble metals of gold and silver implies softening them so
        they run better when molten, and the author-practitioner includes
        recipes for making gold and silver more fluid by adding a substance that
        warms and sweetens (or softens) them. For example, in “Softening [or
        sweetening] gold,” he writes, “Sometimes, there is gold so dry <del>it
        </del> that neither cement nor antimony can soften [or sweeten] it. But
        only verdet can render it soft [or sweet]” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/153v/f/153v/tl"><u>153v</u></a>).
        On the next page, he includes a recipe for “Softening [sweetening]
        silver” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/154r/f/154r/tl"><u>154r</u></a>).
        The addition of what we would nowadays name a “flux,” such as that
        containing “verdet” (or verdigris) as is indicated here, can soften a
        metal so it becomes more liquid and “runs” better through a mold, thus
        showing itself more “tractable” (<em>traictable</em>, fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/106r/f/106r/tl"><u>106r</u></a>).
        The term <em>adoulcir</em> thus has several meanings that are largely
        interchangeable: it can connote “to soften,” “sweeten,” and “smooth.” In
        metals, this can mean to make them more malleable, tractable, or liquid;
        in painting, it can mean to blend the colors, shades, or shadows to
        create a more lifelike effect, while in drawing, it is used to mean
        blending a round form to give it an illusion of volume. The senses of
        <em>adoulcir</em> merge to a degree, all tending toward “tempering” and
        “mollifying” (as Cotgrave’s 1611 <em>Dictionarie</em> also gives), which
        signifies bringing a material or process toward a new, more desirable or
        useful balance among its qualities, or in its outcome.<a href="#fn31"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref31"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a> This understanding of the
        process as “tempering” is part of the early modern worldview in which

    <h2 id="material-imaginary">Material Imaginary</h2>
    <p>The foregoing survey of fat, lean, sweet, and sour in Ms. Fr. 640
        demonstrates that the fatty sand of fols. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/84r/f/84r/tl"><u>84r</u></a>
        and <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/89r/f/89r/tl"><u>89r</u></a>
        with which this essay began is part of a material imaginary, in which
        substances are understood as embodying qualities that can be ranged
        along a spectrum framed by the binary categories of fat-lean and
        sweet-sour. These qualities are simultaneously experiential and
        conceptual, for they are known by experience and the senses, but they
        also organize thought and action.</p>
    <p>These qualities can be observed visually by paying attention to the look
        of the sand bank, or the fluidity of a molten metal, as when the
        author-practitioner notes, “Lead wants not only to be red, but also
        lively &amp; runny &amp; liquid” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/131v/f/131v/tl"><u>131v</u></a>).
        The qualities of the materials are also sensed by feeling, for example,
        in how the sand runs between the fingers, whether the mold materials are
        dry and crumbly or soft and handleable. Material properties are sensed
        by taste, as when the author-practitioner specifies that sal ammoniac
        water used as a fatty <em>magistra</em> for molding sand must taste
        “moderately salty” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/111v/f/111v/tl"><u>111v</u></a>).
        In sensing the qualities of metals, even hearing comes into play, as in
        judging if your alloy of metals contains the correct balance of fat and
        lean metals: “If you put too much lead into the tin, it does not run
        very thin. And to know <sup>this</sup>, if <em>
            <del>l</del>
        </em> the tin cries loudly, it is a sign there is not too much lead. If
        it cries weakly, that means that there is too much” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/131v/f/131v/tl"><u>131v</u></a>).<a

           id="fnref32"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
    <p>The ability to recognize these qualities and to generalize about the
        behavior of materials based on this framework enabled the artisan to
        engage in a process of balancing materials, not just by combining metals
        into different alloys, for example, but also in balancing the fatty
        metal with a lean sand.<a href="#fn33"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref33"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a> The artifice of the
        author-practitioner consisted in broad experience and much trial of
        materials, during which he paid close attention to their behavior, and
        he classified them within this framework—or material imaginary—of binary
        qualities. This gave him the ability to generalize and hypothesize about
        materials and to plan future trials (hence the many notes to “try”
        various materials throughout the manuscript). This material imaginary
        enabled him to make choices about the kinds of sands, binders, and
        metals he sought out, and to test them against his expectations about
        their interactions. And, above all else, the material imaginary
        underpinned his art of rectifying and rendering workable and useful the
        materials provided by nature.</p>

                <p>Other texts of metalworking practice display this same
                    material imaginary, which in many cases worked in tandem
                    with the Aristotelian categories of hot, dry, cold, and wet,
                    as, for example, in Biringuccio’s definition of salt as
                    having a hot, dry nature (Biringuccio, <em>Pirotechnia</em>,
