        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <div>
            <p>The recipe for an “excellent mustard” on fol. <a
                   href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/48r/f/48r/tl"><u>48r</u></a>
                appears to produce a condiment destined directly for the table.
                By contrast, most other entries in the manuscript that concern
                foodstuffs—a relatively small group—give instructions for the
                cultivation and preservation of fruits and other perishables.
                Contemporary authors often stressed the hot and drying effects
                of mustards, and the particular additives used in the
                author-practitioner’s mustard recipe, namely cinnamon and
                cloves, were also understood to have such effects. This suggests
                that the recipe for an “excellent mustard” may relate to the
                various practical medical recipes peppered throughout the
                manuscript.</p>

    <p>At first glance, the recipe for mustard in BnF Ms. Fr. 640 appears to be
        one of very few culinary recipes in the manuscript. This recipe, on fol.
        <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/48r/f/48r/tl"><u>48r</u></a>,
        lies beneath a drawing showing the design of an oven for melting metals,
        and between two sets of instructions—how to cure a dog of mange (above)
        and how to stuff animals and birds (below). Other “culinary” recipes in
        the manuscript include those for vinegar (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/40r/f/40r/tl"><u>40r</u></a>)
        and “Mulled and sugared wine” (<em>Vin brusle et sucre</em>) (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/71r/f/71r/tl"><u>71r</u></a>).
        Most of the “food” recipes in the manuscript are actually related to
        food preservation (fols. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/16v/f/16v/tl"><u>16v</u></a>,
        <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/50r/f/50r/tl"><u>50r</u></a>,
        <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/98v/f/98v/tl"><u>98v</u></a>)
        or medicines (fols. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/7v/f/7v/tl"><u>7v</u></a>,
        <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/20v/f/20v/tl"><u>20v</u></a>,
        <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/37r/f/37r/tl"><u>37r</u></a>,
        <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/47r/f/47r/tl"><u>47r</u></a>,
        <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/77r/f/77r/tl"><u>77r</u></a>).
        For example, “Medicine for the stomach which heats it and unstops the
        liver” (<em>Medecine pour lestomach qui leschaufe et desopile le
            foye</em>) (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/37r/f/37r/tl"><u>37r</u></a>)
        is an opiate which clears gas and phlegm and heals the stomach. There
        are also several recipes related to keeping fruit- or nut-bearing trees.
        A cursory look through the manuscript’s entries left us wondering why
        the author-practitioner had included this particular food recipe for
        mustard in a compilation largely focused on other bodies of knowledge.
        While his curiosity was clearly wide-ranging, it does not seem to have
        extended to the vast body of culinary knowledge that was likely
        available to him. Why mustard then?</p>
    <p>Mustard is mentioned elsewhere in the manuscript as a point of reference
        for the desired thicknesses of different substances (fols. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/89v/f/89v/tl"><u>89v</u></a>,
        <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/113v/f/113v/tl"><u>113v</u></a>,
        <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/121v/f/121v/tl"><u>121v</u></a>).
        These instances suggest that mustard had a relatively consistent
        viscosity that the target reader, if we can speak of one, would have
        been familiar with. These three non-culinary recipes in Ms. Fr. 640
        helped us form a clearer image of what our reconstructed mustard should
        look and feel like—a spreadable paste thicker than sauce. Still, the
        main early modern uses and qualities of mustard were unclear to us
        before beginning our experimentation and research.</p>
    <p>As we ground our yellow mustard seeds by hand in a marble mortar with a
        marble pestle, we noticed no spicy smell wafting up towards our faces,
        only the physical challenge of breaking each tiny, firm seed open and
        pulverizing it (<i><u>Fig. 1</u></i>).<a href="#fn1"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref1"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> The ground cinnamon and cloves,
        added to dried bread, smelled familiarly warm and aromatic (<i><u>Fig. 2</u></i>). In our first trial, we used red wine to soak our
        spiced bread; our second trial was tripartite in that we used Concord
        grape juice, muscat wine, and red wine for three different mustard
        variations (<i><u>Fig. 3</u></i>). In all cases, shortly after the
        spiced liquids combined with the mustard seeds, we were able to smell
        the pungent seeds (<i><u>Fig. 4</u></i>). The initial smell was
        incredibly sweet due to the sugars in the liquids combined with cinnamon
        and cloves, spices we associate with sweet foods and drinks. This
        eventually gave way to the stronger, stinging smell of mustard.</p>

    <p>After tasting it, our first batch of mustard seemed to remain present as
        a burning sensation in our mouths, throats, and stomachs far longer than
        we desired. We later related this tingling to the early modern belief
        that mustard, when applied topically, could draw diseases to the skin’s
        surface so that other medicines could access them.<a href="#fn2"

        made with the three different liquids mentioned above varied in color
        and flavor. The mustard made with muscat wine differed from the other
        two samples primarily in color—it had a golden color familiar to us from
        contemporary mustard (<i><u>Fig. 5</u></i>). Its flavor was milder than
        the red wine mustard but sharper than the Concord grape juice mustard (<i><u>Fig. 6</u></i>).</p>

    <p>A few clues helped us clarify certain aspects of the recipe. First, we
        considered the suggestion about consistency, mentioned above. After our
        first trial, we noticed that the mustard seeds might make a more
        consistent and finer powder if the seed husks were removed (<i><u>Fig. 7</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 8</u></i>), which was confirmed by Hugh
        Plat’s 1602 recipe for “Mustard Meale:”</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>IT is usuall in Venice to sell the meale of Mustarde in their markets
            as we do flower and meale in England: this meale by the addition of
            vinegar in two or three dayes becometh exceeding good mustard, but
            it would bee much stronger and finer, if the husks or huls were
            first divided by searce or boulter, which may easily bee don, if you
            drie your seeds against the fire before you grind them. The Dutch
            iron handmils, or an ordinarie pepper mill may serve for this
            purpose.<a href="#fn3"

               id="fnref3"
               role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>Based on this and our experiences in our
        first trial, we decided to sieve the husks from the seed kernels in our
        later trials, which gave us better results.</p>
    <p> In Plat’s recipe, we learned also that we might have saved time by using
        a hand-mill instead of a mortar and pestle. An illustration in
        Bartolomeo Scappi’s 1570 treatise <em>Opera</em> shows a nutmeg grinder
        (<i><u>Fig. 9</u></i>), suggesting that specialized grinding tools were
        available, and a recipe for “Terre fondue of potters” (<em>Terre fondue
            des potiers</em>) (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/90v/f/90v/tl"><u>90v</u></a>)
        in Ms. Fr. 640 makes use of a “mustard mill” (<em>moulin de
            moustarde</em>).<a href="#fn4"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref4"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> A second image in Scappi’s
        treatise helped us imagine what <em>lestamine</em> (a tammy cloth)
        mentioned in the mustard recipe on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/48r/f/48r/tl"><u>48r</u></a>
        might look like (<i><u>Fig. 10</u></i>). We used a cotton cheesecloth,
        single or doubled-up depending on the thickness of our liquid, as a
        readily available modern substitute for a tammy cloth.</p>

    <p>Our greatest challenges in executing the author-practitioner’s recipe for
        mustard consisted in establishing the correct proportions of liquid to
        dry ingredients and in understanding how long to leave the spiced bread
        in this liquid to achieve the desired thickness. Our first trials left
        us with an extremely thick paste (<i><u>Fig. 11</u></i>), nearly
        impossible to squeeze through one layer of our cotton cheesecloth (<i><u>Fig. 12</u></i>), but later trials left us with a very thin
        liquid. The type of bread used and the way it reacts to manipulation and

    <p>Early European mustard recipes date back to ancient times,<a href="#fn5"

           role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> and black mustard (<em>Brassica
            nigra</em>) and its less pungent relative white (sometimes called
        “yellow”) mustard (<em>Brassica alba</em>) grew in Western Europe at the
        end of the sixteenth century. The availability of the seed and the
        frequency with which mustard is mentioned in early modern recipes
        suggest that the substance was not rare. A 1606 declaration in Rouen,
        reproduced in a nineteenth-century publication, demonstrates that local
        mustard-makers (<em>moutardiers</em>) as well as makers and merchants of
        vinegar (<em>vinaigriers</em>) and sour goods (<em>aigriers</em>) and
        makers of eau-de-vie (<em>faiseurs d’eau de vie</em>) were regulated as
        a profession in response to unhealthy practices like the addition of
        improper ingredients to mustard, such as, “cabbage seeds and rapeseeds,
        which make it oily and bad-tasting, and from one day to the next rotten,
        therefore unfit to enter the human body” (<em>des graines de choux et de
            rabettes qui la randaient huileuse et de mauvaise goût, et du jour
            au lendemain putrefaicte, conséquemment indigne d’entrer au corps
            humain</em>).<a href="#fn6"

           id="fnref6"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> The account mentions that the
        king himself attached such significance to this ordinance as to see it
        through quickly, though the author seems to attribute this haste to
        fiscal reasons. The accompanying ruling stated that active members of
        the aforementioned professions, including <em>moutardiers</em>, had to
        be apprenticed to a master for at least three years. Interestingly,
        although production was limited to authorized masters, “the bourgeois
        will nevertheless be able to make it for their own use” (<em>sera
            néanmoins permis aux bourgeois d’en fair pour leur usage</em>).</p>

           id="fnref7"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> mustard played a unique role,
        though not exclusively a culinary one. According to Galenic humoral
        theory, foods and people were understood to have complexions which
        generally had combinations of two of these four qualities: hot, cold,
        wet, and dry. Substances which had certain of these qualities would
        sometimes, but not always, influence the balance of the associated
        humors within the human body. In his treatise <em>De simplicium
            medicamentorum</em>, Galen mentions that pepper, for example, is
        cold to the touch but has the effect of heating the human body.<a

           id="fnref8"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
    <p>In Robert Pemell’s 1652 treatise on medicinal simples, the mustard seed
        is “hot &amp; dry in the fourth degree.”<a href="#fn9"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref9"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> Accordingly, mustard seeds were
        thought to be good for those suffering from cold and wet diseases like
        gout or “cold stomach” but bad for cholerics. The medicinal properties
        of mustard were directly tied to its influence on cold and wet humors;
        as Pemell writes of mustard: “by the sharpnesse thereof it pierceth to
        the Brain, and purgeth it by sneesing and drawing down rheume and other
        tough humours which by their residence do much offend.”<a href="#fn10"

           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/48r/f/48r/tl"><u>48r</u></a>
        seem to share these basic characteristics. Pemell categorizes cinnamon
        as being “hot and dry in the third degree, or hot in the third-degree
        and dry in the second,” while cloves are “hot and dry in the second or
        third degree.”<a href="#fn11"

           role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> Both are described as being
        used, like mustard, to combat cold and wet disease and are not
        recommended for cholerics. Wine was known to contribute to the general
        revival of spirits, increasing blood flow because it was believed to be
        easily converted into blood.<a href="#fn12"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref12"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> Mustard was also included in the
        category of “aperients,” substances which dilate the inner body,
        increasing flow; again, substances of this category would be detrimental
        to a choleric’s health.<a href="#fn13"

    <p>It would be incorrect to apply our own distinction between medicines and
        foods to the early modern usage of mustard. Nevertheless, it appears
        that the recipe for “excellent mustard” on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/48r/f/48r/tl"><u>48r</u></a>
        is, rather than a culinary anomaly within the manuscript, another
        example of a substance with medicinal properties. The thick and spicy
        paste maintained its “hot and dry” nature even when used as a condiment
        for meats.</p>
    <p>Several early modern authors recommend mustard as a corrective to the
        less desirable qualities of meats and other heavy foods.<a href="#fn14"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref14"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> This union of meat and mustard
        was about more than just flavor. Ken Albala describes a culture in which
        physicians might use ready examples from established culinary practice
        to apply their theoretical principles, for instance that “mustard’s
        cutting and abstersive qualities” might help one to digest heavy meats
        such as pork.<a href="#fn15"

    <p>Our own experience in the kitchen and in the lab confirmed the difference
        between the inert mustard seed’s status as a cold and dry substance and
        its activation into a hot and dry substance through the process of
        making mustard. Chemically, we came to understand that the spiciness in
        the mustard seed, caused by irritants called isothiocyanates, emerges
        when it reacts with liquids: “the combination of moisture and cell
        damage revives the seeds’ enzymes and allows them to liberate the
        pungent compounds from their storage forms.”<a href="#fn19"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref19"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
    <p>Interestingly, using an acidic liquid such as wine or vinegar, the two
        liquids most commonly used in early modern mustard recipes, slows down
        this reaction and makes the pungent taste last longer.<a href="#fn20"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref20"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> This sheds light on a
        recommendation in <em>Le Menagier de Paris</em>: “If you want to make a
        supply of mustard that will keep long, make it during the picking-season
        (of wine grapes) from fresh stum [must].”<a href="#fn21"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref21"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a> In fact, in our own experiments
        making mustard with three different liquids, we found that our mustard
        made with red wine kept for several weeks in a refrigerated airtight
        container and held its sharp flavor even after the other two mustards
        had lost theirs.</p>
    <p>Through a combination of research and direct observation of the powerful
        sensory experience of making and eating mustard, we can now suggest that
        our author-practitioner’s recipe for mustard is as much about its
        medicinal properties as its appeal as a food substance. A powerful
        antidote or accompaniment to other foods, mustard fits into a series of
        recipes for wine- or vinegar-based remedies and other medicines for cold
        and wet diseases (see note 1) within the manuscript. What first appeared
        to us as a superfluous condiment might in fact have been a common
        ingredient in early modern meals, prized for its clearly defined
        physical properties and its effect on the human body.</p>

                <p>In our most successful experiments, we used the following
                    ingredients and protocol: 11 oz. bread (whole wheat or
                    white); 2 sticks cinnamon; 50 cloves; 1.5 cups of red wine,
                    muscat wine, or Concord grape juice; 1 tbsp. yellow mustard
                    seeds. If the bread is not already dry (hard), preheat oven
                    to 300 F. Slice bread into 1-1 ½-inch thick slices. Place
                    bread directly on oven tray and leave until dry, about 18
                    min. In the meantime, grind cloves and cinnamon roughly in
                    mortar with pestle. Grind mustard seeds finely and sift
                    through tight sieve to remove large husks. Remove bread from
                    oven, combine in a bowl with cinnamon and cloves, add 1.5
                    cups liquid of choice, crush all together with pestle, and
                    leave to soak for 20 min or longer, depending on bread.
                    Strain through cotton cheesecloth and combine enough of
                    resulting liquid with ground mustard seeds to produce
