                other entries in Ms. Fr. 640 that aim to produce imitations of
                more expensive materials and to create the impermanent artworks

    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
    <p>The recipe “Damasked cloth” (<em>Drap damasse</em>) on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/15r/f/15r/tl"><u>15r</u></a>
        describes how to make imitations of damask cloth and embroidery by
        creating patterns with dyeing techniques.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>You can damask a cloth with two different colors and imitate
            embroidery without adding anything to it, in this way. Once it is
            dyed yellow, pounce onto it such a pattern as will please you. Then
            you will baste some string or a thicker cord onto the pouncing and
            thrust it into a dye of <em>guesde</em> woad or pastel woad &amp; it
            will become green, except that which is beneath the string, which
            will remain yellow because the green dye will not have penetrated
            there. And you can do thus with other colors, and instead of cord or
            string, add some pieces of paltry cloth, cut into moresque shapes,
            on top of the first color. In that manner, you will have cheap
            embroidery (fol. 15r).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>This recipe is unusual in that it is one
        of the few entries with instructions for dyeing textiles in Ms. Fr. 640.
        It explains how to create patterns by dyeing fabrics yellow first, then
        overdyeing them with a blue dye, with instructions on how to block out
        areas where patterns are to be created. The recipe, however, neither
        mentions materials for obtaining yellow colors nor discusses processes
        of making dyes. What does the missing information on dyeing—necessary
        for the execution of the recipe—tell us about the context of the
        authorship? Did the author-practitioner have any knowledge of dyeing? If
        not, how was he able to write the recipe? Was it simply the result of
        his collecting recipes in circulation, or was it essential to his
        practice? This essay aims to answer these questions by examining
        relevant contemporaneous recipes and conducting hands-on experiments.
    </p>
    <p>Despite being unusual in the manuscript in terms of technique, the recipe
        is not separate from other pursuits in the manuscript: the
        author-practitioner’s interest in imitation is clear throughout Ms. Fr.
        640, and the recipe “Damasked cloth” should be considered in this
        context. Whereas the author-practitioner’s ultimate goal in the numerous
        recipes for casting flowers and imitating gems seems to be to imitate
        the shapes and colors of nature, his concern in this recipe is to
        imitate artifacts. His interest in making fancy fabrics inexpensively is
        similarly found on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/67r/f/67r/tl"><u>67r</u></a>,
        where he mentions techniques to make cheap banners with ephemeral
        materials.</p>
    <p>The ephemeral art of civic and courtly celebrations, which flourished in
        early modern Europe, provides an important perspective for understanding
        the end use of damasked cloth and thus the author-practitioner’s
        intention in writing the recipe. “Ephemeral art” is a generic term for a
        variety of festival decorations and monuments, produced for public
        events such as civic processions, royal entries, weddings, court
        funerals and coronations.<a href="#fn1"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref1"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> As these decorations would
        usually be demolished once the event was over, they were made of
        impermanent materials and thus were not meant to last long.<a

    <h2 id="what-is-damasked-cloth">What is “Damasked cloth”?</h2>
    <p>We initially translated <em>Drap damasse</em> as “Damask cloth,” but, as
        with many other reconstructions of manuscript entries, the process of
        preparing or carrying out a reconstruction leads to a closer reading of
        the text. This revealed that <em>damasse</em> (actually
        <em>damassé</em>) derives from the verb <em>damasser</em> and can thus
        better be translated as “Damasked cloth.”<a href="#fn4"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref4"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> Randle Cotgrave’s <em>Dictionarie
            of the French and English Tongues</em> defines “<em>drap</em>” as
        “cloth,” “woolen cloth,” and “broad cloth,”<a href="#fn5"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref5"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> but it has no entry for the
        adjective “<em>damasse</em>” (i.e., <em>damassé</em>). The
        <em>Dictionnaire du Moyen Francais (1330-1500)</em> defines
        “<em>damassé</em>” as a “pattern in the fashion of damask,” and
        Frédérique Godefroy’s <em>Complément du dictionaire de l’ancienne langue
            française et des tous ses dialectes du IX siècle au XVe siècle</em>
        says that it is “cloth from Damascus, made or fabricated in the fashion
        of damask.”<a href="#fn6"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref6"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> What is “damask”
        (<em>damas</em>)? In the same dictionaries, “<em>damas</em>” is defined
        as a fabric or silk-like cloth originally from the city of Damascus,
        with the <em>Dictionnaire du Moyen Francais</em> describing it as a
        cloth “whose design stands out on matt satin or conversely.”<a
           href="#fn7"

    <p>The definition of “damask” in the early modern period thus generally
        matches more recent definitions. The <em>Dictionary of Textiles,</em>
        published in 1915, states that “the true or double or reversible damask
        is woven both the ground and the large floral Jacquard patterns in
        eight-leaf satin and the single damask in five-leaf satin weave.…
        Usually made of cotton or linen and&nbsp;used on the table.”<a
           href="#fn8"

           id="fnref8"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> <em>Fairchild’s Dictionary of
            Textiles,</em> published in 1959, provides further information on
        its history and use:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Originally a rich silk fabric with woven floral designs made in China
            and introduced into Europe through Damascus, from which it derived
            its name… Damask has been made for centuries and is one of the
            oldest and most popular staple cloths. Used for upholstery and
            draperies, table cloths, napkins, bedspreads, face towels, evening
            wear, etc.<a href="#fn9"

    </blockquote>
    <p>The Victoria and Albert Museum defines “damask” as “a woven material
        whose effect depends on the differing play of light on its pattern
        surfaces, which alternate between the smooth face and the contrasting
        reverse of satin weave.”<a href="#fn10"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref10"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> This definition makes it clear
        that the patterns of “damask” are created using identical colors of
        threads for warp and weft. In other words, its patterns are created by
        difference in luster rather than color, as we can see from a damask
        cloth made in Italy between 1600 and 1650 (<i><u>Fig. 1</u></i>).</p>

    <p>To sum up, in the early modern period, “damask” referred to “patterned
        woven textiles,” often used for “interior decoration.” The
        author-practitioner’s goal in the recipe “Damasked cloth” is to imitate
        “damask” not by weaving but by dyeing. His plan is to first dye a cloth
        yellow, then block out desired areas with string or cloth pieces, and,
        finally, overdye the fabric with a blue dye. In this way, while the
        ground would turn green, the blocked areas would remain yellow and thus
        create patterns. His instructions on how to block areas on the cloth
        with string, cord and cloth pieces is very detailed, suggesting a strong
        possibility that he designed and carried out the recipe himself.<a
           href="#fn11"

           id="fnref11"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
    <p>However, over the course of preparing for the reconstruction, we began to
        doubt the feasibility of the procedure. We initially translated <em>tu
            faulfileras</em> as “you will sew loosely.” But given dye’s tendency
        to run through the fibers of cloth, it seemed unlikely that the desired
        dye-resist effect would be obtained by sewing strings “loosely” to block
        out the targeted area. To achieve dye-resist effects, the area has to be
        blocked out very tightly (something I learned from my hands-on
        experience of tie-dye at an indigo-dye specialist’s workshop in northern
        Thailand).<a href="#fn12"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref12"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> Moreover, the Centre National de
        Ressources Textuelles et Lexicales (CNRTL) defines “faufiler” as
        “attaching big ornaments provisionally onto a piece of cloth,” thus we
        realized that a better translation of <em>tu faulfileras</em> would be
        “you will baste.”<a href="#fn13"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref13"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> With tight basting, the blue dye
        might be kept from penetrating the side where the string was sewn, but
        it seemed to us that the blue dye would ultimately penetrate the cloth
        from the other side, where string was not sewn. Similarly, adding “some
        pieces of paltry cloth, cut into moresque shapes, on top of the first
        color” did not seem as if it would be effective, as when the whole cloth
        was soaked in the woad dye, the blue dye would easily penetrate the
        cloth pieces that were supposed to resist it, and reach the areas
        beneath that were designed to remain yellow. In this way, it seemed the
        blue dye would color the entire cloth evenly green.</p>
    <h2 id="dyeing-yellow-weld">Dyeing Yellow: Weld</h2>
    <p>The recipe “Damasked cloth” does not specify which materials can provide
        yellow dyes, however, Ms. Fr. 640 includes the following ingredients for
        yellow dyes and pigments: saffron (<em>safran</em>, fols. <a

                ml beaker. We imagined a tin dish, whose surface area would not
                have been greater than that of the kettle. Then we sourced a

    <p>What differentiates this recipe from most modern dye recipes is not only
        the lack of precise quantities but also the use of ash. Wood ash,
        generally made into lye, was used to help extract dyes from plants when
        making them into pigments,<a href="#fn24"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref24"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a> and from this, we can presume
        that the ash was used to help extract yellow dye from the weld. Most
        modern recipes, however, do not include ash or lye. Instead, they define
        weld as a plant requiring mordants such as alum and copper.<a
           href="#fn25"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref25"

        mordant, for instance, weld dye produces an intense yellow.<a

        including this one.</p>
    <p>The liquid mixture of water, weld, and ash—made as instructed in the
        recipe—was murky throughout the experiment (<i><u>Fig. 3</u></i>).
        However, after washing off all the residues, we obtained good yellow
        colors of varying shades: a light yellow on the white silk (<i><u>Fig. 4</u></i>), a relatively dark yellow on the unbleached cotton (<i><u>Fig. 5</u></i>), and a greenish yellow on the unbleached linen (<i><u>Fig. 6</u></i>). It is hard to tell precisely what caused the
        shades to vary, because both the properties of the fibers and the ground
        colors of the fabrics before dyeing have an effect. For instance, even
        though cotton is harder to dye than other fabrics, we achieved a fairly
        deep yellow on the cotton fabric. That was in part because we used
        unbleached cotton, whose ivory color was already close to yellow.</p>

    <p>With potash alum, a typical mordant used in modern recipes for weld
        dyeing, we might have obtained a far stronger yellow color on all the
        fabrics. But it is uncertain if such an intense color is what the recipe
        intended. Although alum was available in the late sixteenth century, the
        recipe does not specify its use. More importantly, our reconstruction
        proves that this weld solution can yield good yellow colors. The
        relatively simple procedure also suggests that yellow dyes were easy to
        obtain, in contrast to blue dye made from woad.</p>
    <h2 id="dyeing-blue-woad">Dyeing Blue: Woad</h2>
    <p>For the blue dye, unlike the yellow, the recipe “Damasked cloth” suggests
        specific materials for achieving the color: woad, or as the
        author-practitioner called it, <em>guesde ou pastel</em>.<a href="#fn27"

        the limited choice of materials for blue. Whereas Europeans could obtain
        yellow dyes from a wide variety of plants, for blue dyes, they depended
        on woad as their major source, at least before the indigo plant
        proliferated over the course of the sixteenth and seventeenth
        centuries.<a href="#fn28"

        other materials in small quantities do not keep double-entry books,
        those who sell in bulk and deal in woad have double-entry books because
        it is important for them to keep detailed records.</p>

        practical instruction on how to process the leaves, which suggests that
        the author-practitioner did not practice woad-dyeing himself. This
        becomes even more apparent in the line that reads: “One assays it in the
        dyers’ vat, and to fill a vat with it, one needs six balls of it (fol.

        author-practitioner was not the dyer, however, just before this, the
        author-practitioner writes, “The goodness of the pastel woad is known
        when, put in the mouth, it gives a taste as of vinegar, or when
        crumbling &amp; breaking it, it has some mold-like veins which are as if
        golden or silver.” These vivid descriptions would seem to have come from
        first-hand accounts or even from his own experience of the woad dye.</p>

        for extracting dyes from flowers contains similar information, although
        no details about the process of making dyes. Both these recipes prove
        his interest in the uses of flowers and where they can be found—rather
        than the process of dyeing per se—and explain the meager description of
        the dyeing process in the recipe “Damasked cloth<em>.</em>” His interest
        in these plants perhaps also connects to the numerous recipes for making
        life cast flowers in Ms. Fr. 640. Over the course of sourcing flowers
        for casting, he may have become familiar with their habitats and
        characteristics, including their dyeing properties.</p>
    <p>Although the author-practitioner apparently did not practice woad dyeing,
        by being based in Toulouse, which at that time was the center of woad
        production and trade, he would not have had much difficulty sourcing
        woad dyes from one of the local dyers. The early modern method of making
        woad dyes was laborious and complicated. After harvesting, the leaves
        were crushed and reduced to a paste, which then was molded into balls
        and dried. The dried woad balls could be kept for a long time and were
        easily transported. To be used for dyeing, these balls were broken up,
        mixed with water, and fermented.<a href="#fn32"

    <p>The contrasting results on the cotton and on the silk can be explained in
        two ways. One is that cotton is generally harder to dye than silk.
        Another explanation is that the cotton fabric used in the experiment was
        thicker than the silk. It would have taken longer for the blue dye to
        penetrate the cotton cloth. If we had used thicker and coarser fabrics,
        we could have obtained much better results. This suggests that, if the
        author-practitioner intended thick and coarse fabrics in the recipe, his
        procedure makes sense, and he may actually have experimented himself
        with this technique. With his skill and the good quality woad dyes made
        in Toulouse, he might well have produced much better “damasked cloth”
        with clearer patterns.</p>
    <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The reconstruction of the recipe “Damasked cloth” suggests that the
        author-practitioner may have practiced the technique himself. Our
        initial doubt about the recipe’s feasibility—on the basis of the scanty
        explanation of the dyeing process and the seemingly infeasible procedure
        provided—was partially laid to rest over the course of reconstruction.
        The author-practitioner does not seem to have been a specialist in
        dyeing. Even if he made yellow dyes himself, the procedure for which is
        relatively simple, he does not seem to have made woad dye. Instead, he
        probably sourced those dyes from elsewhere. Our reconstruction also
        reveals that his instructions were not as implausible as they first
        appeared. The patterns created on the cotton cloth confirm that the
        desired effects suggested in the recipe could be obtained, and thus the
        text could have been based on the author-practitioner’s own practice. As
        noted throughout this essay, preparing and carrying out a reconstruction
        prompted us to engage with the manuscript more actively, critically, and
        carefully, and thus can be viewed as a powerful method of close,
        critical reading.</p>
    <p>The “Damasked cloth” would never have matched the elegant luster of
        authentic damask but the imitation could have had its own uses. By
        examining the recipe “Damasked cloth” in the historical context of the
        ephemeral art in early modern Europe, we can surmise why the
        author-practitioner might have collected and carried out this recipe.
        Given that damask was often used for “interior decoration,” there was
        probably high demand for cheaper imitations for decorative purposes at
        festivals and public events. As many craftsmen and artists were employed
        in preparing such events,<a href="#fn42"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref42"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>42</sup></a> it is possible that the
        author-practitioner was involved in such work and that the recipe was
        written for such temporary ends.</p>
    <p>Versatility was an important virtue of the artist and the craftsman in
        the early modern period.<a href="#fn43"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref43"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>43</sup></a> Even court artists were often
        employed to produce practical and decorative works, thus it is difficult
        to draw a line between “applied or decorative art” and “high art.”<a
           href="#fn44"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref44"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>44</sup></a> Such versatility is well
        observed in the author-practitioner’s work, which encompasses a wide
        variety of techniques, mediums and materials, and demonstrates
        applications of known techniques to different materials. The recipe
        “Damasked cloth” is evidence of this versatility as well as the probable
        significance of ephemeral art in the author-practitioner’s life.
        Scholarly research on ephemeral art has relied largely on chronicles and
        texts written by court historians,<a href="#fn45"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref45"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>45</sup></a> thus Ms. Fr. 640 helps broaden
        our source base and allows us insight into the production of ephemeral
        works of art and daily life from the perspectives of materials,
        techniques, and artisanal production.</p>

                    This seemingly minor change in translation, from “sew
                    loosely” to “baste” has an impact on the feasibility of the
                    recipe. If we do not have to sew strings loosely, but rather
                    sew them firmly albeit provisionally, the likelihood that
                    they will block the absorption of woad dye into the cloth
                    increases. As the strings are to be removed after dyeing,
                    the term “provisionally,” as is the intention of basting,
                    also makes sense here.<a href="#fnref13"

                <p>Kirby et al., <em>Natural Colorants</em> provides a modern
                    English translation of the original Dutch recipe, which we
                    referred to when reading the sixteenth-century English
                    translation. The authors translated it from the original
                    Dutch text, <em>T’Bouck van wondre.</em> Their translation:
                    “Idem for four pounds of wool yarn or cloth you shall take
                    two pounds of weld. This weld is put in a kettle and clean
                    water is added. To that is also added half a tin dish of
                    ashes from the fire. And then, as soon as it boils, take
                    your wool yarn and put it in. Thus let it boil for [the time
                    of reciting] eight or nine Pater nosters. Then take out your
                    yarn and put some water in your kettle and add also some ash
                    from the fireplace. Then again put in your wool and let it

                    simply another name for “woad.” Secondary sources describe
                    “pastel” as a French term for “woad.” Cardon states that
                    “after harvesting, the [woad] leaves were crushed in woad
                    mills and reduced to a pulp or paste…[t]his is why woad is

                    defines “pastel” as “Dyers Woad (of a finer sort then that

                    Guesde, and the finer Pastel.” Cotgrave,

                <p>Kirby et al., <em>Natural Colorants</em>, 17-19. The dye
                    named “indigo” can be obtained from both woad and the indigo
                    plant. More specifically, the blue coloring matter,
                    indigotin, which is insoluble, exists in the form of soluble
                    precursor glycosides in the leaves of these plants. Woad and
                    the indigo plant have one of these glycosides in common,
                    which is known as indican; woad has additional precursor
                    glycosides called isatan A and isatan B. When the leaves are
                    crushed, the indican reacts to the oxygen in the air,
                    forming insoluble blue indigotin, which is then processed
                    into indigo. In order to dye textiles, the indigotin needs
                    to be rendered soluble again in an alkaline solution so that
                    it can impregnate the fibers. Once the fibers are exposed to
                    the air, the indigotin re-forms. The indigo plant was
                    imported into Europe even before medieval times but used
                    mostly as a pigment. Its use as a dye was prohibited to
                    protect the woad industry until the sixteenth or seventeenth
                    century. The major difference between woad and the indigo
                    plant is their efficiency in dyeing. When used in the same
                    amount, the indigo plant yields a larger quantity of indigo
                    dye than woad, and this is why the indigo plant ultimately
                    came to replace woad in Europe. See C.P. de Lasteyrie, <em>A

                <p>Chemical dyeing dates back to the eighteenth century, when
                    scientists began to search for ways to reduce indigotin
                    faster than fermentation. In 1870, a French chemist invented
                    a method that used sodium dithionite (sodium hydrosulphite)
                    and caustic soda as powerful reducing agents; this formed
                    the basis of contemporary manuals for synthetic and natural
                    woad dyeing. Cardon, <em>Natural Dyes</em>, 351-52. For our
                    experiment, we used thiourea dioxide, a safer substitute for
                    sodium dithionite (sodium hydrosulphite), and soda ash
                    (sodium carbonate) instead of caustic soda. For the

                <p>Extracting indigo from woad is a relatively recent procedure.
                    It began in the early nineteenth century, inspired by the
                    technique of extracting indigo in the form of powdered
                    pigment from the indigo plant. Cardon, <em>Natural
                        Dyes</em>, 370. We used imported woad extracts from
                    France.<a href="#fnref40"

                <p>For “moresques,” we searched “Moresque,” “between 1350-1750,”
                    “made in France” on the V&amp;A website, which yielded
                    numerous prints for goldsmith’s ornaments. This suggests
                    that the moresque designs were circulating among French
                    artisans for use in various crafts.<a href="#fnref41"
