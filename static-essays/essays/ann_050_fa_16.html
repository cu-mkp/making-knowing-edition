        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <div>
            <p>This essay addresses the role of materials not as physical
                ingredients or tools but as mediators between familiar and
                unfamiliar processes, taking bread and baking in the manuscript
                as a case study. References to bread in entries that do not
                employ this food use the familiar activity of baking to
                elucidate unfamiliar technical processes, such as when making
                stucco, to “knead it as if you wanted to make bread” (fol. <a
                   href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/29r/f/29r/tl"><u>29r</u></a>).
                The author-practitioner turns assumed tactile memories in his
                reader into descriptive devices and implies the primacy of touch
                in craft practice. Current neuroscientific research argues that
                touch is the most sensitive of the senses and is strongly linked
                to memory-making; this might help explain the prominence of
                tactile descriptions in craft and technical writing. The use of
                familiar materials and processes as mediators in written
                accounts enables craftspeople recording procedural and embodied
                knowledge to bridge the gap between experience and words.</p>

    <p>The compilation of recipes in Ms. Fr. 640 is the result of interest in
        craft practice in early modern Europe. At this time, artisans and
        practitioners began committing their knowledge to paper, an impulse that
        both revealed the wealth of their technical knowledge and the challenge
        of using words to describe processes.<a href="#fn1"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref1"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> Their reliance on the senses in
        their practice is evident in many of these writings, and Ms. Fr. 640 is
        no exception; the manuscript’s position between various genres of
        technical writing makes this reliance even more significant.<a
           href="#fn2"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref2"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> Other essays have treated
        the author-practitioner’s references to the visual appearance of
        materials; this essay, however, will focus on the tactile qualities
        of everyday materials and their role as mediating devices<a href="#fn3"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref3"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> between familiar and unfamiliar
        processes, with bread and the experience of baking as a case study.<a

           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref4"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> Using a familiar process such as
        baking bread, the author-practitioner elucidates a less familiar
        technique by assuming that the reader has tactile memories of bread. In
        this essay, the tactile experience of bread making and its capacity
        to mediate is illuminated by the Aristotelian theory of memory, its
        reception by medieval authorities, and current neuroscientific research
        on touch and tactile memory.</p>
    <p>Ms. Fr. 640 is an intriguing manuscript that features an array of
        different recipes for such incongruous processes as disguising a horse,
        molding sulfur, plucking forehead hairs, and making mustard. As such, it
        sits somewhere between the miscellany and the encyclopedia.<a
           href="#fn5"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref5"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> Indeed, the author-practitioner’s
        struggle for a structure reminiscent of the encyclopedia, most
        noticeable in his efforts to group related recipes together, is offset
        by the nature of the manuscript as a work in progress, with sections
        interrupting others and certain folios rendered all but illegible by an
        abundance of marginal notes and additions.</p>
    <p>The experimental quality of the manuscript makes classifying it
        difficult. Its use of vernacular French and its wide array of topics
        align it with books of secrets.<a href="#fn6"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref6"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> And yet, the fact that so many of
        the recipes in Ms. Fr. 640 are works in progress distances this
        manuscript from this genre. The books of secrets generally did not
        include experimental content, as William Eamon argues, but instead
        adopted an authoritative tone that encouraged the reader to follow the
        procedure to the letter.<a href="#fn7"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref7"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> The experimentation evident in
        Ms. Fr. 640 might constitute the work necessary for compiling a book of
        secrets, which would have been elided in the final version.<a
           href="#fn8"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref8"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
    <p>The recipe collection is another genre in which to locate Ms. Fr. 640.
        Certainly, the manuscript is similar to a recipe collection in medium,
        form, genesis, and content. A recipe book simultaneously functions as a
        repository of knowledge and as an <em>aide-mémoire</em>, offering up new
        information to its readers and engaging their know-how through
        references to tacit knowledge.<a href="#fn9"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref9"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> Corrections and additions were
        not foreign to this genre. The author-practitioner demonstrates varying
        degrees of involvement with the recipes he records in Ms. Fr. 640. Some
        recipes he clearly tried and reworked, while others he appears to have
        copied from elsewhere and perhaps never attempted. Recipes in recipe
        books were often collected through personal relationships with members
        of a community.<a href="#fn10"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref10"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> In Ms. Fr. 640, certain recipes
        appear to be the result of contact or even relationships with artisans,
        as seen, for example, on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/61v/f/61v/tl"><u>61v</u></a>
        where the author-practitioner describes how Germans make
        <em>chassis</em>.</p>
    <p>Despite its similarities to a recipe book, Ms. Fr. 640 features few
        culinary recipes, and none for bread, although foodstuffs are ubiquitous
        in the manuscript. The essay “<em>Pain, Ostie, Rostie</em>: Bread
        in Early Modern Europe” examined evidence for the physical presence of
        bread in artisanal contexts, and it showed the particularity and variety
        of what constituted bread and the widespread familiarity with bread and
        its baking in early modern Europe.<a href="#fn11"

    <p>Ms. Fr. 640 features several passing references to bread that, while
        appearing unremarkable, in fact point to several significant features,
        notably the sensory and embodied process of making, and the tactile
        memories presupposed in the reader (Table 1).</p>

    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>These references in Ms. Fr. 640 touch on
        various stages in the production of bread, from kneading to baking to
        eating. For example, fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/29r/f/29r/tl"><u>29r</u></a>
        presents a recipe for making stucco that instructs the reader to handle
        the material in ways analogous to bread making: “knead as if you wanted
        to make bread.”<a href="#fn13"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref13"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> It is striking that the word
        <em>paste</em>, meaning “dough,” is used to refer to the mixture of all
        the ingredients that are to be kneaded in such a manner, a designation
        that may have come naturally to the author-practitioner as two of the
        ingredients for stucco—flour and water—are essential elements for making
        bread.<a href="#fn14"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref14"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> Logically, the kneaded mixture
        is then likened in firmness to “bread dough that is ready for the oven.”
    </p>
    <p>Baking comes next in the production cycle of bread making. An important
        group of recipes refers to the temperature of the oven after baking
        bread to indicate the heat of the oven for processes unrelated to bread
        baking, such as drying animals. These recipes curiously relate to others
        on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/140v/f/140v/tl"><u>140v</u></a>
        for casting in wax and sulfur, in which the physical material of the
        mold is bread. While the recipes for casting animals specify the
        temperature of the oven to be “as hot as when bread has been taken out,”
        in those for casting in wax and sulfur the author-practitioner states
        that “bread straight from the oven is best” to make the molds, implying
        a similar degree of heat for two different processes. Even so, the
        injunction to use bread straight from the oven may not be as helpful as
        it appears. Bread can be composed of a variety of ingredients, and
        baking requirements vary accordingly.<a href="#fn15"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref15"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> The consistent reference in Ms.
        Fr. 640 to an oven might offer a clue to the kind of bread baked, and
        thus to how hot the oven might have been. Indeed, wheat bread required a
        moderately heated oven, unlike bread made with other flours, which could
        be baked at lower temperatures before the hearth in earthenware pots.<a
           href="#fn16"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref16"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> The abundance of wheat available
        in Toulouse makes it likely that the author-practitioner meant wheat
        bread.<a href="#fn17"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref17"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> Furthermore, we might speculate
        that the oven to dry animals should not have been so hot as to singe
        their fur, thus the moderate heat for wheat bread seems likely.</p>
    <p>The cycle of bread making concludes with its consumption. On this point,
        a recipe on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/114v/f/114v/tl"><u>114v</u></a>
        instructs the reader to pull apart two halves of a mold “as if you
        wanted to tear bread apart,” referring to bread ready for eating. Here
        again, the differing consistencies characteristic of different bread
        varieties renders this reference less than straightforward. A coarser
        rye bread would require more force to tear than a fine, light wheat
        bread. Regardless of what kind of bread one was accustomed to eating,
        this simile prompts a vivid memory that every reader would share:
        breaking bread for a meal. Thus, a familiar action is used here to
        illuminate the unfamiliar or less familiar one of pulling apart two
        halves of a mold for casting.</p>
    <p>The role of bread baking in the manuscript recalls the embodied nature of
        craft knowledge and betrays a “sensory appreciation” for the feel and
        form of materials.<a href="#fn18"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref18"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> This sensory knowledge finds its
        parallel in the writings of Theophrastus Bombast von Hohenheim, known as

        become akin to a religious ritual, a meditative act repeated over and
        over until it became second nature.</p>
    <p>Bread speaks eloquently to the potential spiritual dimensions of embodied
        craft practice. The act of kneading, in which human flesh and
        bread-flesh become as if one, may have reminded an artisan of material
        transformations of religious sacrament, ritualized practice, and the
        enspiriting of matter. In the Eucharist, bread transforms into the flesh
        of Christ, whereas in the act of baking, the body of the baker becomes
        part of the bread as sweat and saliva permeate the dough.<a href="#fn23"

        eyewitnesses described how the agony of the baker—bare-chested, crying,

        kneading.<a href="#fn24"

    <p>The union of human body and bread is, of course, most complete in the act
        of eating. Galen of Pergamon, the renowned second-century Greek
        physician, described the relationship between eating and cognitive
        functions like memory. Galen’s humoral theory elaborated the gradual
        transformation of foodstuffs into the four humors—blood, black bile,
        yellow bile, and phlegm—that nourished the flesh of the body.<a

    <p>There is a long tradition of ancient and Christian thought dealing with
        the relationship between the material and the immaterial, perhaps best
        exemplified by the Eucharist, evoking both simultaneously. The problem
        of matter is considered in Aristotle’s <em>De memoria et
            reminiscentia</em> and Thomas Aquinas’s <em>Summa Theologiae</em>.
        In the first, Aristotle expounds on how memories are formed as an image
        of an object that travels from the outer senses (sight, hearing, smell,
        touch, and taste) through to the internal senses (imagination, memory,
        common sense, estimation, and cogitation) by way of the animal
        spirits.<a href="#fn29"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref29"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a> The corporeal senses thus
        function as springboards for the formulation of mnemonic images. That
        the internal senses are superior precisely because they lack
        corporeality, as Grant Williams argues, was succinctly stated by
        Aquinas: “Thus the intellect, which abstracts species not only from
        matter, but even from the individuating material conditions, has more
        perfect knowledge than the senses, which, while they receive the form of
        things known without matter, do not do so without these material
        conditions.”<a href="#fn30"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref30"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a> The abstracted matter is
        acquired through the senses, of which touch is the most sensitive.
        Aquinas, in his <em>Commentary on Aristotle’s De Anima</em>, makes an
        argument for touch being the most embodied of the five senses:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Yet it might seem that mental capacity corresponded rather to
            excellence of sight than of touch, for sight is the more spiritual
            sense, and reveals better the differences between things. Still,
            there are two reasons for maintaining that excellence of mind is
            proportionate to fineness of touch. In the first place touch is the
            basis of sensitivity as a whole; for obviously the organ of touch
            pervades the whole body, so that the organ of each of the other
            senses is also an organ of touch, and the sense of touch by itself
            constitutes a being as sensitive. Therefore, the finer one’s sense
            of touch, the better, strictly speaking, is one’s sensitive nature
            as a whole, and consequently the higher one’s intellectual capacity.
            For a fine sensitivity is a disposition to a fine intelligence.<a

               role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>For Aquinas, then, human intelligence is
        best sparked by the sense of touch because it is the most sensitive.</p>
    <p>Recent neuroscientific work resonates with Aquinas’s argument. The
        mechanisms that perceive touch have been shown to be the same as those
        that make tactile memories, linking both functions intimately.<a
           href="#fn32"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref32"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a> Tactile memories are formed
        implicitly, and tactile information is stored without a person being
        aware of perceiving the information.<a href="#fn33"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref33"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a> In other words, according to
        recent research, we are highly sensitive to tactile stimuli and remember
        them although we may not have noticed acquiring the memories. In bread
        making, the process of kneading becomes familiar through repetition and
        forms tactile memories over time. According to this research, both touch
        and tactile memory are multisensory, involving tactile as well as visual
        elements, which renders more vivid the memories of tactile experiences.
        Tactile memories often involve a visualization of the touch event, which
        may make employing the tactile information easier.<a href="#fn34"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref34"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a> Thus when the
        author-practitioner invokes the memory of pulling bread apart, what
        comes to mind is both the tactile experience of tearing a loaf of bread
        and the visualization of this act.</p>
    <p>The sense of touch is multisensory also because it is made up of several
        sensory systems: the kinesthetic, which enables us to perceive movement;
        the cutaneous, which involves perceiving through the skin; and the
        haptic, which may also be called active touch, and characterizes those
        tactile perceptions that are initiated by the perceiver, rather than
        those in which he or she is a passive receiver of touch.<a href="#fn35"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref35"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>35</sup></a> These sensory systems play a
        role in our experience of the life of bread. Kneading and eating involve
        haptic and kinesthetic touch through the movement of the hands and their
        interaction with bread. Taking bread out of the oven involves these two
        sensory systems in addition to the cutaneous, as heat is perceived
        through the skin.</p>
    <p>The primacy of the kinesthetic and haptic sensory systems for our
        experience of the life of bread is enabled by the hand, which carries
        out all of these processes. The hand is well-suited to perform these
        tactile processes for several reasons. First, the hand, unlike the eye,
        is both a sensory and a motor organ.<a href="#fn36"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref36"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>36</sup></a> The hand can thus move and
        perceive at the same time, for instance, gathering tactile information
        as it kneads dough. Second, the fingertips are more sensitive to tactile
        stimuli than other parts of the body, thus they collect more information
        for the creation of tactile memories.<a href="#fn37"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref37"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>37</sup></a> These memories make processes
        such as kneading or pulling bread apart familiar to their performer.
        Third, as Raymond Talis argues, human intelligence “develops in parallel
        with manipulative precision and not with increasing visual acuity and
        more complex visual awareness.”<a href="#fn38"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref38"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>38</sup></a> The intellect is therefore more
        closely associated with the sense of touch than with that of sight. The
        hand thus simultaneously acts, knows, and communicates.<a href="#fn39"
           class="footnote-ref"

    <p>The writings of the author-practitioner and other artisans attempt to
        convey their embodied—often visceral and ineffable—knowledge in words.
        Their use of material mediators, such as bread, draw on tactile memories
        and tacit know-how, and employ similes to overcome the problem of
        expressing embodied knowledge in words. Bread, with its symbolic and
        material multivalence, exemplifies this practice.</p>
