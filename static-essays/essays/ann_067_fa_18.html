        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <div>
            <p>BnF Ms. Fr. 640 contains a number of entries about image transfer
                techniques, including “For writing as well from the left as from
                the right” (fol. <a
                   href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/19v/f/19v/tl"><u>19v</u></a>),
                “Pounced design for scratching satin” (<a
                   href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/42v/f/42v/tl"><u>42v</u></a>),
                and “Making counterproofs” (<a
                   href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/51r/f/51r/tl"><u>51r</u></a>).
                Using reconstruction and historical research, this essay
                considers these image transfer techniques in terms of the
                principles they employ and the ways they transform the original
                image in the process of transferring it onto a new surface. It
                compares these entries with an image transfer technique used in
                Tokugawa Japanese woodblock printing, examining in particular
                whether the techniques transfer the image as a mirror image and
                the degree to which the techniques destroy the original image in
                the process. This comparison reveals that the technique used to
                transfer an image from one surface to another is inherently
                intertwined with the kinds of values that are assigned to the
                original image and its copy.</p>

    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
    <p>Techniques for transferring an image from one object to another can be
        found as intermediary steps in a wide variety of craft procedures,
        including metal casting, printmaking, and embroidery. Ultimately, any
        time an artist or craftsperson translates a sketched design into a
        finished product, he or she is making use of some kind of image transfer
        technique. Given its ubiquity as an intermediary process in artistic
        production, it is not surprising that many of the author-practitioner’s
        recipes outline image transfer techniques. Among these are recipes for
        “writing as well from the left as from the right” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/19v/f/19v/tl"><u>19v</u></a>),
        “pounced design for scratching satin” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/42v/f/42v/tl"><u>42v</u></a>),
        and “counterproofing” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/51r/f/51r/tl"><u>51r</u></a>).
        Along with historical research, reconstructions of these three recipes
        demonstrate the principles of image transfer used in each, highlighting
        how each technique deals with problems common to the image transferring
        process, such as mirroring and destructiveness.</p>
    <p>As BnF Ms. Fr. 640 is one of the few known sixteenth-century sources to
        describe counterproofing, this essay pays particular attention to the
        author-practitioner’s entry on this technique. It situates this entry
        within its historical context and compares it with other recorded
        counterproofing methods from the sixteenth century to the nineteenth
        century. It also compares counterproofing as a technique for
        transferring images with other methods described in the manuscript as
        well as a method from an entirely different historical context: Japanese
        woodblock printing. By considering the kinds of intermediary steps and
        principles these various techniques employ, this essay develops an
        understanding of the different ways an image is transformed when it is
        transferred.<a href="#fn1"

    <h2 id="counterproofing-in-context">Counterproofing in Context</h2>
    <p>Counterproofing is a printing technique used for many different purposes
        since at least the sixteenth century. It involves offsetting ink from a
        printed surface onto a new plate or fresh piece of paper.<a href="#fn2"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref2"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> In his wide-ranging study of
        historical intaglio printmaking, Ad Stijnman explores a variety of
        counterproofing techniques, all of which begin, as the
        author-practitioner’s technique does, with a print. One such method for
        transferring a design from a print to a plate involves placing a fresh
        print onto an uncut plate while the ink is still wet, and running it
        through the press. If the printed ink is already dry, the print can be
        soaked in water, soap water, or a diluted lye solution (depending on how
        old the ink on the print is), in order to reactivate the ink; after
        this, it can be run through the press with the new plate to offset the
        design onto this plate.<a href="#fn3"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref3"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> The design can then be etched or
        engraved to make a new plate for printing the image. As Stijnman writes,
        this was an “ideal way of replicating a plate in order to extend the
        print run,” or to create a new plate from an image whose original plate
        no longer existed.<a href="#fn4"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref4"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> As counterproofing is a kind of
        stamping technique, in which one object is pressed against another in
        order to transfer an image, it necessarily transfers the image in
        reverse. However, when the transferred image is used to make a new plate
        or block for printing, the process of printing reverses the image yet
        again. Therefore, the final image printed from the new plate is oriented
        in the same direction as the image from which the counterproof was
        initially pulled (<u>Fig. 1</u>).</p>

    <p>In addition to the manuscript, one of the other few sixteenth-century
        authors to document a counterproofing technique is Giorgio Vasari
        (1511–1574). Vasari describes using counterproofs to make the multiple
        blocks for his <em>chiaroscuro</em> woodblock prints (for an example of
        a <em>chiaroscuro</em> print, see <u>Fig. 2</u>). His process begins with a carved block featuring all the lines of
        the print and a second block featuring “all that is tinted near to the
        shadow.”<a href="#fn5"

    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>Like the examples described above,
        Vasari’s counterproofing technique involves transferring a printed image
        onto a block or plate for printing. Vasari uses woodblocks for relief
        printing, but the image transfer principle is exactly the same for
        plates for intaglio printing. His technique differs, however, in the way
        it utilizes the counterproofed image. Unlike the methods described
        above, Vasari does not use the counterproof technique to reproduce the
        exact same image onto a new block. Rather, the image he transfers serves
        as a reference for him to create a different but interrelated block. By
        painting onto the image with white lead, Vasari marks the parts of the
        print he wants to remain white. These parts alone are then carved away,
        and the rest of the block is tinted. This block then serves to print the
        background on top of which the other two blocks print the shadows and
        the lines of the image. Like the techniques above, this kind of
        counterproof takes advantage of the double mirroring in order to print a
        final image that is oriented in the same direction as the print on which
        it was based. But here, the counterproofed image serves more as a
        helpful guide for lining up a series of interrelated but incomplete
        blocks so that they harmonize together to form a final composite image.
    </p>
    <p>From the sixteenth century onward, there are other examples of
        counterproof techniques that more closely resemble the kind we see in
        the manuscript, namely, counterproofing an image from paper to paper.
        This kind of counterproof results in a completed print of an image
        rather than a new plate. Unlike the method used for creating a new plate
        or block, a counterproof that is printed on a piece of paper result in a
        final printed piece that is the mirror image of its original (<u>Fig. 3</u>, <u>Fig. 4</u>, and <u>Fig. 5</u>). In
        many cases, the reversal of the image apparently was not a concern. For
        example, half of naturalist and printmaker Maria Sibylla Merian’s
        (1647–1717) Surinam books feature original engraved prints whereas the
        other half feature those same images in mirrored counterproofs. Though
        the reason why the books were made this way is unknown, Stijnman
        speculates that because the creatures depicted in Merian’s illustrations
        are quite symmetrical, and because counterproofing was a fast and
        cost-effective way of doubling the number of prints, neither Merian nor
        the publishers were concerned about the orientation of the
        illustrations.<a href="#fn7"

    <p>The counterproofed image differs from a typical print pulled from a block
        or plate in a few important ways. The image that results when a
        counterproof is pulled directly onto a fresh sheet of paper does not
        feature the three-dimensional embossing effect that is created when a
        print is taken from a plate or block.<a href="#fn8"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref8"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> Additionally, depending on the
        depth of the grooves in the original intaglio plate and the amount of
        ink that was therefore transferred onto the original print, the quality
        of line differs between a print and its counterproof. Stijnman shows an
        original Rembrandt van Rijn (1606–1669) print of <em>The Three
            Crosses</em> side by side with its counterproof, which documents the
        relative softness of the counterproof’s lines.<a href="#fn9"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref9"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> In fact, some artists appear to
        have actively played with this particular characteristic of counterproof
        images. The highly experimental artist Hercules Segers (1589–1638) was
        perhaps the first to see his counterproofs as pieces of art rather than
        stored records of a given print. Like his other prints, Segers’s known
        counterproofs feature overpainting and other kinds of experimental
        manipulations, which, as Seigneur argues, shows that he considered his
        counterproofs on par with his other prints.<a href="#fn10"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref10"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> Pierre-Auguste Renoir
        (1841–1919), too, seems to have used the counterproof technique for its
        unique aesthetic effect. In particular, he is known for his counterproof
        pastel images, the lighter, airier lines of which “reinforce the
        delicate, sensual, and pleasurable touch of the artist’s hand.”<a
           href="#fn11"

           id="fnref11"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
    <p>Like the method described in Ms. Fr. 640, the counterproofing techniques
        used by Merian, Segers, and Renoir involve transferring a printed image
        from paper to paper.<a href="#fn12"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref12"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> Whereas these techniques take
        the mirror image print as the finished product, the
        author-practitioner’s method includes a further set of techniques that
        results in a finished product with the same orientation as the original
        image, and which is traced rather than directly printed or stamped.<a
           href="#fn13"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref13"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> While the author-practitioner
        leaves room for the reader to end the process after the initial
        counterproof, he also provides instructions for turning the paper
        transparent using oil (either turpentine or spike lavender) and then
        tracing the lines on the opposite side of the paper, rendering the image
        the right way around once again (<u>Fig. 6</u>). By heating the
        oil-soaked paper, the author-practitioner claims that traces of the oil
        will disappear and the finished image will have the same orientation as
        the original. My attempt to pull a counterproof from a dried print using
        soap water served only as a proof of concept and was not successful
        enough to use for the remaining steps the author-practitioner outlines (<u>Fig. 7</u>). However, by pulling a counterproof from a fresh
        print and by then soaking in oil and retracing the image on the reverse
        side of the paper, my reconstruction clearly demonstrated the multiple
        image mirrorings resulting from a final image that is oriented the same
        way as the original (<u>Fig. 8</u>), (<u>Fig. 9</u>).<a

    <p>Unlike Merian, who appeared unconcerned with the direction of her nature
        illustrations, the author-practitioner seems to care about reproducing
        the image not as a mirror-image, but as it was originally printed. He
        takes counterproof images that other artists would consider finished
        products and turns them into yet another intermediary step in his
        process. The question, then, is why is he concerned with the orientation
        of the image? Given the wide range of ideas about the nature of an image
        and its mirror image in early modern Europe, gaining a sense of why the
        author-practitioner includes information about how to translate the
        counterproof back into a non-mirrored image might shed further light on
        his understanding of intermediary and copied images.</p>
    <p>In the absence of a written explanation, it is difficult to know why
        exactly the author-practitioner was concerned with the orientation of
        the final counterproofed image, however, one text that offers a clue is
        <em>Der zu vielen Wissenschafften dienstlich-anweisende Curiöse
            Künstler</em> (“The curious artist serving and instructing in many
        sciences”), a technical manual of craft techniques written by Adam
        Friedrich Kirsch published in Nuremberg in 1703. In an entry for
        counterproofing directly onto another piece of paper, Kirsch suggests
        that the technique is inappropriate for prints that feature text, since
        “the writing is reversed and can only be read in a mirror.” For “mere
        copper engravings,” however, the technique works fine.<a href="#fn15"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref15"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> This is, of course, true: images
        can be “read” and understood whether they are in their original or their
        mirror, particularly, as Stijnman suggests, when they are images of
        symmetrical things, such as animals and humans. This is true even when
        left and right have particular associations coded into them, such as an
        individual’s handedness. Rembrandt in particular was known for his
        prints depicting Jesus raising his left hand rather than his right. But
        this was evidently overlooked by consumers at the time.<a href="#fn16"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref16"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
    <p>Writing, on the other hand, loses meaning in its reversal. Thus, although
        we cannot know for certain, it is plausible that the author-practitioner
        imagined his readers counterproofing images that included text. This
        relationship between writing and mirror images is also relevant to how
        we understand the author-practitioner’s “for writing as well from the
        left as from the right” recipe. Given that the recipe ends with a letter
        rendered in its mirror image (<u>Fig. 10</u>), it is possible
        that this recipe was meant to serve as an intermediary step in a longer
        process that would involve another mirroring, rendering the letter the
        right way around again. One such longer process, of course, would be
        printing. It is also possible that this recipe was merely intended as a
        kind of “trick,” in which the author-practitioner presents a difficult
        challenge—writing letters in their mirror image—which he solves with a
        simple solution: stamping.<a href="#fn17"

    <p>Other interesting examples of counterproofs with regard to this
        discussion of writing and mirror images are Mary Cassatt’s (1844–1926)
        pastel counterproofs. Among these are counterproofs pulled from pastel
        images that the artist had already signed. These counterproofs, which
        again feature a soft, delicate line that seems to have been actively
        sought out during the nineteenth century’s impressionist movement,
        feature the signature in the mirror image.<a href="#fn18"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref18"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> Ambroise Vollard, the
        commissioner of these counterproofs, was apparently not concerned about
        the mirrored signature, though it remains unknown whether he imagined
        these mirror-image counterproofs of the original pastel as completed
        works in and of themselves or as an intermediary step in a longer
        process; indeed, he may have thought of them as both.<a href="#fn19"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref19"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a> What this perhaps demonstrates
        is the fact that writing can serve multiple functions. In the case of
        text that is meant to be read for meaning, of course, it is important
        that the letters and words are not mirrored. In the case of a signature,
        which documents the creator of the piece but does not convey any other
        textual meaning, a mirror image of the writing appears to serve the
        intended function just as well.</p>
    <p>Although the author-practitioner’s ideas about the importance of
        transferring images in the same orientation as the original ultimately
        remains ambiguous in his counterproofing recipe, one point that he
        emphasizes clearly is the technique’s non-destructive quality. On fol.
        51r, he even presents a clear situation (“if, by chance, you borrowed
        the piece”) in which not destroying the original piece for the sake of
        making a copy would be important. My reconstruction demonstrated that
        his claims are at least plausible. While my attempts to reactivate the
        oil-based ink using soap water were only successful at demonstrating a
        proof of concept, the prints I attempted to counterproof using the
        author-practitioner’s recipe remain remarkably unaltered, minus some
        bunched paper fibers that came about only after a long series of
        soap-water soaks and perhaps overly vigorous rubbing with a sponge (<u>Fig. 11</u>). They did yellow slightly, which the
        author-practitioner warns will happen unless gummed soap water is used,
        but my reconstruction caused very little yellowing. Additionally, the
        counterproof I made with a fresh print did not alter the original in any
        visible way, even as it took up much more of the ink than my soap water
        attempts. In contrast to this technique that preserved the original,
        other recipes in the manuscript describe another image transfer
        method—pouncing—that is much more destructive in nature.</p>

        Pouncing versus Counterproofing: An Exploration of Destructiveness</h2>
    <p>Pouncing is a technique that involves poking holes along the lines of an
        image on a piece of paper. This paper is then placed on top of another
        object, and charcoal or other fine powder (such as flour or chalk, as
        described in the manuscript) is pressed through these holes (<u>Fig. 12</u>). Cennino Cennini’s (c. 1360–c. 1440) <em>Libro
            dell’Arte</em> contains perhaps the first known description of this
        technique, which was used frequently by fresco painters in Renaissance
        Italy, but the technique appears to have been known since at least the
        tenth century in China, and it has been used throughout the world as an
        image transfer technique in a wide variety of crafts.<a href="#fn20"

    <p>The various uses of pouncing can be seen in Ms. Fr. 640 as well. The term
        can refer to the act of spreading out fine powder over an entire surface
        area, as can be seen in “Casting in frames.”<a href="#fn22"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref22"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a> More often, it refers to the
        particular kind of pouncing using a pierced template as described
        above—not only in the recipe for “Pounced design for scratching satin,”
        but also in “For stampings to embellish and encrust or cover the edges
        of mirrors, the tops of chests, or the friezes of bed valances” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/6v/f/6v/tl"><u>6v</u></a>),<a

           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/66r/f/66r/tl"><u>66r</u></a>–v).
        Additionally, the recipe for tracing a history on glass uses pouncing as
        a metaphor to describe a related technique. In this recipe, the reader
        is instructed to poke the pin through the paper directly onto the gilt
        glass, thereby marking the gilt surface directly rather than indirectly
        by applying a powder through the pricked paper onto the glass. Stijnman
        notes that this kind of “pouncing” was also used in etching, whereby the
        craftsperson would push the needle directly onto a plate covered in
        etching ground in order to transfer the design.<a href="#fn25"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref25"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a> It was beyond the scope of this
        essay to pounce on gilded glass, which is done using soot black or
        lampblack in “Gilding molding panels” and directly onto the surface in
        “Tracing some history on glass” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/39v/f/39v/tl"><u>39v</u></a>–40r),<a

           role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a> nor did I attempt it on iron or
        copper, which is done in “For stampings to embellish and encrust or
        cover the edges of mirrors, the tops of chests, or the friezes of bed
        valances.” However, my reconstruction of the scratched satin
        recipe—which appears to be a recipe for pinking satin with an egg white
        and fig milk-based reinforcement—did suggest that pouncing works better
        on certain materials than it does on others.<a href="#fn27"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref27"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
    <p>In my reconstruction, I tested my pouncing paper first on another sheet
        of paper to make sure the charcoal was being pressed through the holes (<u>Fig. 13</u>). Although the paper did not capture as much of
        the detail as I had hoped, I decided after a few tests to move on to the
        satin fabric. I found that the satin fabric captured much more of the
        detail than the paper had, making for a much clearer pounced image (<u>Fig. 14</u>). This is likely due to the differences between
        fabric and paper and the way they interact with fine powder. Whereas the
        charcoal seemed to sit atop the paper and smudged quite easily or was
        blown away when the paper was moved, the threads of the satin fabric
        “caught” the charcoal powder and held it more firmly in place. It is
        easy to imagine that wet stucco, as used by fresco painters, would also
        hold the charcoal powder. This may be one reason why pouncing is
        employed twice in the manuscript for fabric and never for paper.</p>

    <p>The relative destructiveness of pouncing when compared with
        counterproofing speaks to a different understanding of the “original”
        image and the value it is given in the two techniques. In addition to
        poking holes through the original image, pouncing with charcoal or other
        black powder completely obscures the lines of the original when applied
        from the top (<u>Fig. 15</u>). Indeed, the destructiveness of the
        pouncing technique was recognized in the sixteenth century, for example
        by the Bruges goldsmiths who sued an artist for destroying an old banner
        by using it as a template to pounce the pattern onto a new one.<a

        that the paper used for pouncing is not entirely destroyed, but can
        continue to be used as a pouncing template multiple times. Unlike the
        image that is counterproofed, this initial image no longer has value in
        and of itself; its value is instead dependent on its ability to recreate
        the same image on a different surface.<a href="#fn29"

    <p>In considering the level of destructiveness in the image transfer
        process, it is perhaps useful to consider a third technique, one in
        which the original image is entirely destroyed in order to transfer it
        onto something else. The technique I will discuss here is the one used
        in Japanese woodblock printing. Although this method is part of an
        entirely different historical context from that of the
        author-practitioner, it complements the comparison of counterproofing
        and pouncing by demonstrating how techniques used to transfer images are
        bound up in the kinds of value assigned to the original image.</p>

        A Completely Destructive Technique: Image Transfer in Japanese Woodblock
        Printing</h2>
    <p>Examples of woodblock-printed material can be found in Japan as early as
        the eighth century CE. These early examples were largely Buddhist texts
        that had been brought to Japan from China.<a href="#fn30"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref30"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a> While movable type was
        introduced to Japan after it was developed in China in the eleventh
        century, Japanese printers found that woodblocks were a much more
        suitable technology for their written language (which is often written
        in highly cursive script that includes phonetic Japanese readings of the
        Chinese characters, glossed in small writing to the right of the
        characters), and so this technique remained dominant through the
        Tokugawa period (1600–1868). It was during this period that Japanese
        painters and woodblock carvers developed the elaborate, multi-colored
        woodblock prints that are today known as <em>ukiyo-e</em> (literally
        “images of the floating world”).<a href="#fn31"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref31"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
    <p>In the first step of the woodblock-making process, an artist would create
        a sketch or preparatory picture, called <em>shita-e</em>, of the image
        to be printed. Depending on the completeness of this sketch, a copyist
        would create a more complete version of the drawing, called
        <em>hanshita-e</em>, which was then sent off to a woodblock carver.<a
           href="#fn32"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref32"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a> Unlike either counterproofing or
        pouncing, the method that Japanese woodblock cutters used to transfer an
        image onto the block completely destroys the original image. In his book
        <em>Japanese Prints</em>, Ellis Tinios provides a very detailed
        description of the process by which block cutters transferred the design
        of the <em>hanshita</em> drawing onto a woodblock:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>The cutter prepared a block to receive the drawing by spreading rice
            paste as smoothly as possible on it, using the heel of his hand. The
            rice paste was left until it was surface dry. He then took a broad,
            slightly moistened brush and swept it once up and down the face of
            the treated block to activate the paste. Next, he immediately
            positioned one edge of the block drawing along the near edge of the
            block. The rest of the sheet was quickly flipped over, face down, on
            to the block and gently smoothed out with the fingers. Finally, he
            rubbed the entire back of the paper gently with a tool called the
            <em>baren</em> until the surface was completely smooth. The block
            was left to dry for at least twenty-four hours to produce a very
            tight bond between the paper and the surface of the wood.</p>
        <p>Once the block and block-ready drawing had dried completely, the
            cutter rubbed the back of the drawing with wet fingers to remove the
            upper layers of paper fibres. This left the thin layer of fibres
            that carried the artist’s design firmly bonded to the surface of the
            block. He then put camellia oil on his fingers and carefully rubbed
            it over the back of the exposed drawing. This made the paper
            transparent, revealing all the fine details of the design. The block
            was now ready for cutting.<a href="#fn33"
               class="footnote-ref"
               id="fnref33"
               role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Like the technique for counterproofing an image onto a plate or block,
        this method takes advantage of two image reversals (the first being when
        the image is pasted face down onto the block and then revealed in
        reverse with oil, the second being when the final block is printed onto
        paper) to ensure that the final printed image is oriented in the same
        direction as the original sketch (<u>Fig. 16</u>). Because
        Japanese prints so often featured writing, it is easy to imagine that it
        was of the utmost importance that the finished print was oriented in the
        same direction as the initial drawing. Just like the
        author-practitioner’s counterproofing technique, the Japanese method
        uses oil to make the paper transparent in order to reveal the image from
        the other side. However, instead of offsetting some ink from the
        original image or transforming the image into a stencil by poking small
        holes into it, this technique completely destroys the image, which is
        physically attached to the medium it is being transferred to and is then
        cut away. Once the block has been carved, the woodblock cutter wets any
        of the remaining paper in order to detach the rice paste glue and remove
        the paper from the block.<a href="#fn34"

    <p>Like the <em>chiaroscuro</em> woodblock prints discussed earlier, each
        colored <em>ukiyo-e</em> print requires multiple blocks, all of which
        are carefully coordinated so that they come together to form a complete
        image. Like Vasari’s technique, Japanese woodblock cutters would take
        <em>kyogo</em>, or prints taken from the key block that featured all of
        the black lines of the image, and transfer these to new blocks to serve
        as a reference, ensuring that the color blocks were in register with the
        key block when they were successively printed to form the final image.
        Unlike Vasari’s technique, however, these prints were not transferred to
        the block using counterproofing, but were instead pasted onto the block
        face down and treated just as the initial <em>hanshita-e</em>.<a
           href="#fn35"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref35"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
    <p>In Japanese woodblock printing, the <em>hanshita-e</em> is intended as a
        preparatory sketch, not a finished product. Therefore, its value is tied
        to its ability to create a woodblock, which in turn is valuable for its
        ability to create a finished print. The same is true of the original
        images that are transformed into stencils for pouncing. Because it does
        not compromise the original image, however, counterproofing suggests the
        potential for a different relationship between the original image and
        its transferred version, and we see this potential reflected in the ways
        the counterproofing technique was used. While some original images used
        for counterproofs were intended to be used for their image transfer
        capabilities and do not have value as images in and of themselves, in
        other instances, the original image retained its value as a complete and
        finished image, and the counterproof was used to create a new plate to
        extend a printing run or to double the number of images created in an
        economical fashion.</p>
    <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>A comparison of these three techniques for transferring an image
        demonstrates the inherent relationship between the technique and the
        values associated with the original and transferred images. The
        author-practitioner’s counterproofing recipe focuses on the technique’s
        non-destructiveness in order to emphasize that it can be used even when
        replicating an image borrowed from someone else. Unlike the pouncing
        technique or the technique of pasting the image onto a woodblock, the
        original image remains valuable as a complete and final piece in and of
        itself. In the semi-destructive pouncing technique, the original image
        is altered with pricks and charcoal powder and is therefore only
        valuable insofar as it can function as a stencil, but does still
        physically exist. In the entirely destructive Japanese woodblock image
        transfer method, the original image is completely destroyed in the
        process of creating a woodblock, which in turn serves as the stencil
        from which finished printed images are created. Unlike the image from
        which a counterproof is taken, the images that are transferred in
        pouncing and woodblock-cutting are designed specifically to be used in
        this way; they are not valuable as images in and of themselves, but
        rather as images that create valuable images: their value lies in their
        ability to create a block, plate, or stencil from which a finished image
        can be created.<a href="#fn36"

    <p>This essay has also demonstrated the way in which certain images retain
        the same meaning even as they are mirrored in the image transfer process
        whereas others—most notably text—lose meaning when transferred in
        reverse. Different techniques address this issue of mirroring images in
        different ways. Where counterproofing an image onto a plate or block and
        the Japanese technique for woodblock printing make use of two image
        reversals in order to render a final image that is oriented in the same
        direction as the original, counterproofing directly from paper to paper
        renders the final image in reverse. Although Kirsch’s
        seventeenth-century manual suggests that this makes the paper-to-paper
        counterproof method inappropriate for images with text, the
        author-practitioner’s method employs a second image reversal by
        revealing the counterproofed image on the other side of the paper to
        render the final image in the same orientation as the original.</p>
    <p>Images can be transferred from one surface to another in a variety of
        ways, but each image transfer technique involves transforming the image
        in the process. This essay has been concerned with two kinds of
        transformation: mirroring and destructiveness. My exploration of image
        transfer techniques from the manuscript and image transfer in Japanese
        woodblock printing has demonstrated that a relationship exists between
        the value of the original image—whether or not it can be destroyed in
        the process of its transfer and whether or not it retains meaning in its
        mirror image—and the techniques that are used to transfer it onto
        another surface. In this way, this essay suggests that developing a
        robust understanding of the process by which an object is made—the kind
        of transformations it undergoes in the intermediary steps and the ways
        in which materials are manipulated or even destroyed—can offer a great
        deal of insight into the kinds of value that are assigned to each part
        of the making process.</p>

                <p>Additionally, unlike the stamping technique used in
                    counterproofing and making stamped ornaments, pouncing
                    offers more flexibility in terms of the direction in which
                    the image is transferred. Because the holes penetrate
                    entirely through the paper, the image can be transferred in
                    its original when the powder is applied from the side the
                    image was originally drawn on, or it can be transferred in
                    its reverse by flipping the paper over and applying the
                    powder from the other side. This is not noted by the
                    author-practitioner, however, and once the stencil has been
                    pounced with charcoal or some other black powder, it cannot
                    easily be used from the other side, as the excess charcoal
                    would transfer onto the surface of whatever is being pounced
