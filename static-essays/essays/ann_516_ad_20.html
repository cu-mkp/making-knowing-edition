        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <div>
            <p>The entry “Perspective” on fol. <a
                   href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/62v/f/62v/tl"><u>62v</u></a>
                describes and depicts practical tools to help an artist
                construct the underdrawing for an oil painting according to the
                rules of linear perspective, including a ruler for laying down
                orthogonals that converge at a single vanishing point. The
                author-practitioner describes two different designs for this
                tool and even provides an illustration of one of them. However,
                this drawing, when reconstructed, yields a sub-optimal result.
                It is unclear whether the author-practitioner had first-hand
                knowledge of such a tool, invented it as he wrote without
                thinking through the design, or exaggerated certain features in
                his drawing that, when reproduced as depicted, made the tool
                problematic to use.</p>

    <p>The author-practitioner’s interest in linear perspective, or the system
        of creating illusionistic renderings of spatial depth on a planar
        surface such as a painted panel, was practical in orientation rather
        than theoretical—much like his interest in the art of painting in
        general.<a href="#fn1"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref1"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> Linear perspective was supposedly
        discovered by Florentine sculptor and architect Filippo Brunelleschi
        (ca. 1410–1425) and first described by Leon Battista Alberti in <em>De
            pictura</em> (ca. 1435).<a href="#fn2"

           role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> By the time the
        author-practitioner was writing in the late sixteenth century, numerous

        few, those by artists Piero della Francesca (ca. 1470), Albrecht Dürer
        (1525), and Jean Cousin the Elder (1560)—father of the Jean Cousin

        entitled “Perspectives,” notes a few practical issues in producing a
        painting with an illusion of depth. A further entry on the subject, this
        one entitled “Perspective” (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/62v/f/62v/tl"><u>62v</u></a>),
        describes workshop tools for constructing a perspectival drawing or
        underdrawing, and it also reflects on the difficulties of painting in
        perspective. This second entry is the focus of this essay. The
        author-practitioner’s ambiguous phrasing and his illustration of an
        apparently unworkable “ruler” for drawing in perspective raise questions
        about how well acquainted he was with the painter’s craft.</p>
    <h2 id="the-entry">The Entry</h2>
    <p>“Perspective” (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/62v/f/62v/tl"><u>62v</u></a>)
        is part of a cluster of entries between fols. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/56r/f/56r/tl"><u>56r</u></a>
        and <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/67r/f/67r/tl"><u>67r</u></a>
        dedicated to the art of painting. These entries address various aspects
        of the craft, including the preparation of panels and pigments, the
        application of paint for the depiction of flesh and drapery, the use of
        varnish, and the practical training of apprentices. Though there seems
        to be little logic to the organization of these entries, and we cannot
        discern among this cluster the attempt to offer a treatise on painting
        per se, it is clear that “Perspective” is part of the
        author-practitioner’s information gathering on the painter’s art. In
        fact, the description of tools for drawing seems to follow up on the
        ideas expressed in the preceding entry on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/62v/f/62v/tl"><u>62v</u></a>,
        entitled “Drawing,” which notes, “to become an artist, one needs to draw
        by eye, without compass or ruler. Masters do not allow apprentices to do
        this.” This entry may have prompted the author-practitioner to explore
        the drafting tools that a young artist needed before he or she had
        learned to draw by eye.</p>
    <p>In an entry dedicated to linear perspective, we might expect the
        author-practitioner to provide a means of setting down on a blank
        support a grid-structure for a brand new depiction (<i><u>Fig. 1</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 2</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 3</u></i>). However, the opening line
        of the entry seems to suggest that orthogonals are already in place: “to
        know the [vanishing] point, one needs to lay down a ruler over the
        lines, &amp; at the intersection [<em>desmenee</em>] of these, the point
        will be.” If we take the author-practitioner’s phrasing at face value,
        he seems to offer a means to understand the perspectival construction
        beneath an extant drawing—or at least a means to gauge the accuracy of a
        preparatory sketch that could be further improved.</p>

    <p>The author-practitioner goes on to describe two types of ruler that could
        be helpful in accommodating a picture to the exigencies of linear
        perspective. In each case, the tool is characterized by the ability to
        pivot a ruler around a fixed or hinged point set along the horizon line
        at the vanishing point. The first design (hereafter, “pivot ruler”)
        seems to involve piercing a hole through the end of a ruler so that it
        can be rotated around a pin set in a panel: “Some make a hole at the end
        of their rulers to fix the point by that hole &amp; move the ruler
        about.” The second design (hereafter, “double ruler”), which he draws on
        fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/62v/f/62v/tl"><u>62v</u></a>
        (<i><u>Fig. 4</u></i>), involves two rulers—one hinged by its end with a
        screw to the center of another: “Others lay down a ruler across the
        panel, then on this laid-down ruler they set the tip of another ruler,
        which, attached to the former by means of a screw, moves about &amp;
        reaches as far as necessary without losing the point.” While it is clear
        that the base ruler of this second tool should lie across the horizon
        line of the panel, a marginal note clarifies that the tool was only to
        be used at the design stage to construct the underdrawing of a panel:
        “To paint perspective in oil, you ought not to use a ruler, for you
        would smudge everything. But when layering your colors you need to keep
        to the &amp; follow the lines of your first drawing.” This note expands
        on information given about the “first drawing” in the entry
        “Perspectives” on the previous page (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/62r/f/62r/tl"><u>62r</u></a>):
        “Perspectives in oil take a long time because of several lines that need
        to be done with a ruler, and for this reason one usually does them in
        distemper.”</p>

        also makes provision for drawing reliable vertical lines—an essential
        part of architectural views especially (<i><u>Fig. 5</u></i>). Below the
        drawing of the ruler, the author-practitioner instructs to make a plumb
        line from a piece of lead, a thread, and a small hook, so that the line
        can be hung from the top of the panel. The author-practitioner even
        draws this tool in the margin (<i><u>Fig. 6</u></i>).</p>

    <p>The author-practitioner appears to have made his drawing of the double
        ruler after he wrote the penultimate sentence of the “Perspective”
        entry. The final sentence seems to have been written in afterwards, as
        it is in a slightly more compressed script and is partially written over
        the drawing. Significantly, this sentence states that “the ruler and
        compass without the judgement of the eye cause errors. Perspective is
        very difficult.” As the rest of this essay will show, the double ruler
        is a problematic tool. Therefore, it seems likely that the
        author-practitioner wrote the description of the tool, drew what he had
        described, tried to make the device, discovered that it was problematic
        in design, and thus “warned” the reader about the need to exercise
        judgment when using such tools.</p>
    <h2 id="the-questions-and-preliminary-research">The Questions and
        Preliminary Research</h2>
    <p>Given our respective professional experiences in architecture (van Buren)
        and fine woodworking (Wang), we approached the entry with questions
        about the potential utility of the tools and their practical
        construction. Is the description and illustration of the double ruler
        based on observation? That is, did such a tool exist at the time? Is it
        possible to follow the instructions given in the entry to build this
        tool? And how well might this tool function in constructing a drawing in
        perspective? We also wondered about the role of the artist’s eye in
        drawing, guiding, correcting, or supplementing the points and lines
        determined by the tool.</p>
    <p>Our research did not yield evidence that a tool like the
        author-practitioner’s double ruler was known or used. The logic behind
        the pivot ruler resembles, however distantly, the artisanal practice of
        snapping taut chalked or dyed lines against surfaces being prepared for
        painting, while the plumb line was a very commonly used tool among
        painters.<a href="#fn4"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref4"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
    <h2 id="the-double-ruler-reconstructed">The Double Ruler Reconstructed</h2>
    <p>In Spring 2017, Ariane van Buren constructed paper and very preliminary
        wooden prototypes of the author-practitioner’s double ruler. These gave
        a poor result (<i><u>Fig. 7</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 8</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 9</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 10</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 11</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 12</u></i>). The receding lines did not converge in a single
        vanishing point because the rulers were wide and the screw, or pivot
        point, was located at the center of the width of each ruler (i.e., a
        half-inch from the ruler’s edge). The width of each of the rulers
        prevented the optimal functioning of the tool, and the greater that
        width, the greater the problem.</p>

    <p>Successive trials moved the pin joining the two rulers closer and closer
        to the rulers’ edge. This allowed the orthogonals to come closer to
        converging at a single vanishing point, located at the center of the
        pin. It became clear that in order for the double ruler to function, the
        two components would have to be joined in a way that offset the pin. The
        final mock-up put the pivot at the actual edge of the rulers, which was
        only possible by adding a flap to each of the rulers that could then
        overlap. Our design took inspiration from images of early modern drawing
        instruments in the Museo Galileo, Florence, in the National Museum of
        American History, Washington D.C., and in the History of Science Museum,
        Oxford.<a href="#fn5"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref5"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> With this final mock-up, a single
        vanishing point was neatly drawn. Nevertheless, this mock-up tool
        certainly did not match what the author-practitioner had depicted in the
        entry, although a generous reading of his description that ignores his
        drawing might result in a functional tool.</p>
    <p>In sum, the double ruler tool does not seem to work as drawn. To obtain a
        consistent vanishing point, the sides of the rulers used to draw the
        horizon line and orthogonals cannot overlap as the mobile arm pivots.
        Rulers overlapping by half their width, as illustrated on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/62v/f/62v/tl"><u>62v</u></a>,
        prevent the receding lines from reaching a single point. Significantly,
        this problem is equally relevant for the pivot ruler—the first design
        described by the author-practitioner in the “Perspective” entry.</p>
    <p>In Fall 2017, Casa Wang reconstructed wooden prototypes for the double
        ruler depicted on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/62v/f/62v/tl"><u>62v</u></a>
        and, by way of comparison, a nineteenth-century tool for making
        two-point perspective drawings, the centrolinead. For the double ruler,
        Wang constructed the base ruler as the author-practitioner depicted it,
        and he made three versions of the mobile arm, one following the drawing
        on fol. 62v and the other two experimenting with the placement of the
        hole in order to improve the design (<i><u>Fig. 13</u></i>). He gave the
        base ruler squiggly ends, as seen in the author-practitioner’s drawing,
        surmising that these ends may have been used to affix the base ruler to
        the panel or drawing using nails or pins, rather than being decorative
        alone.</p>

    <p>Unsurprisingly, the reconstructed double ruler that followed the
        author-practitioner’s drawing yielded results no different than the
        paper prototypes; that is, the lines did not converge at a single
        vanishing point. By contrast, the lines drawn using each of Wang’s
        experimental arms were on track to converge successfully at a single
        vanishing point positioned beneath the screw, though the breadth of the
        base ruler impeded the final few millimeters of the convergence proper.
    </p>
    <p>Wang’s reconstruction of the centrolinead (<i><u>Fig. 14</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 15</u></i>) gave us a better sense of how artists, albeit
        later ones, might have used drawing aids to help construct more complex
        perspectival drawings. The utility of the centrolinead reinforced our
        sense that the author-practitioner had less first-hand experience in the
        arts of drawing and painting than in other areas of craft, such as fine
        metalwork.</p>

    <h2 id="perspective-is-very-difficult.">“Perspective is very difficult.”
    </h2>
    <p>If the author-practitioner was trying to use the double ruler he
        described and depicted on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/62v/f/62v/tl"><u>62v</u></a>
        to draw in perspective, then his comment that “perspective is very
        difficult” is understandable. As demonstrated even with our paper
        prototype, there are obvious impracticalities with the double ruler’s
        design. Yet there are good reasons to question the author-practitioner’s
        familiarity with the rules of one-point perspective. On fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/62r/f/62r/tl"><u>62r</u></a>,
        in the entry “Perspectives,” he writes: “One takes the points at one’s
        discretion. The main thing in this lies in having the knowledge of the
        point. One commonly makes two or three of them, sometimes five.” If by
        “the point” (<em>poinct</em>), he means the vanishing point, then this
        is a rather puzzling statement.<a href="#fn6"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref6"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
    <p>Given the author-practitioner’s interest in virtuoso feats of craft, such
        as molding and casting extremely delicate works of nature like butterfly
        wings, and the contemporary vogue for virtuoso depictions of complex
        polygons in perspective, such as those seen in Wenzel Jamnitzer’s 1568
        <em>Perspectiva Corporum Regularium</em> (<i><u>Fig. 16</u></i>), it is
        all the more surprising that his entry on perspective is so cursory.
        Perhaps his drawing of the double ruler reflects an experimental idea he
        had for a useful tool—something he intended to expand upon later, much
        like his quick sketch of the mechanism for a spinet that plays by itself
        on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/104v/f/104v/tl"><u>104v</u></a>.
        Perhaps it was a drawing akin to his illustration of a perpetual
        fountain on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/80r/f/80r/tl"><u>80r</u></a>,
        which he likely did not realize was an impossibility.<a href="#fn7"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref7"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> Or, perhaps the drawing
        exaggerates certain features of the double ruler, namely the width of
        the two arms, for the sake of legibility, which effectively renders the
        drawing impractical as a guide for construction. When the entry
        “Perspective” (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/62v/f/62v/tl"><u>62v</u></a>)
        is read in conjunction with “Perspectives” on the previous page, which
        seems to suggest that up to five vanishing points were customarily
        placed within a composition, we can rightfully question whether the
        author-practitioner aimed to convey the process of creating works using
        one-point perspective or something else entirely. Whatever the case may
        be, the author-practitioner’s final words in the “Perspective” entry
        ring true: “The ruler and compass without the judgement of the eye cause
        errors. Perspective is very difficult.”</p>
