        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <div>
            <p>The entry “For cages” on fol. <a
                   href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/6v/f/6v/tl"><u>6v</u></a>
                describes a specialized glassworking process, the manipulation
                of glass canes for lampworking and beadmaking. Third person
                description suggests that the author-practitioner observed
                glassworkers lengthening hollow canes, and his familiarity with
                particular tools, materials, and processes used in lampworking
                and beadmaking support this hypothesis. While functional cages
                for keeping animals are discussed elsewhere in the manuscript,
                “For cages” is situated among other entries concerning the
                embellishment of readymade objects and suggests the
                author-practitioner’s interest in applying the decorative
                techniques of lampworkers. My reconstruction suggests ways to
                fuse and bend wire and glass that could be learned by
                observation or developed experimentally by someone without
                extensive training. The author-practitioner’s attention to
                various glassworking industries and their specialized products
                in Ms. Fr. 640 suggests that he used technical knowledge
                gathered from encounters with other artisans to inform and
                augment his own wide-ranging artisanal activities.</p>

        glass or glassmakers directly, the entry “For cages” on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/6v/f/6v/tl"><u>6v</u></a>
        describes a specialized glassworking process: the manipulation of glass

           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref5"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> The entry includes instructions
        for working with glass on a small enough scale to be reproducible in the
        Making and Knowing Laboratory. The references to glass in the manuscript
        together with my research and reconstruction suggest that the
        author-practitioner used technical knowledge gathered from encounters
        with other artisans to inform his experimentation in the workshop.</p>
    <p>The manuscript’s descriptive entries indicate that the
        author-practitioner had a ready knowledge of both the raw materials used
        by glassmakers and the techniques used to work them into functional
        objects. Through a consideration of the glassmaking profession in
        general and a reconstruction of the entry “For cages” in particular,
        this essay situates the author-practitioner’s diverse activities within
        the broader context of artisanal practice in France during the sixteenth
        century. The author-practitioner’s use of third person plural when
        describing some glassworking techniques indicates that he likely
        observed glassmakers at work in a glasshouse. Furthermore, his technical
        knowledge of the equipment and materials used in lampworking and
        beadmaking suggests some connection with these industries. The content
        and context of the entry “For cages” within the manuscript suggests that
        he used materials, processes, and techniques that he learned from these
        artisans in his own work.</p>
    <p>In researching and reconstructing the entry on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/6v/f/6v/tl"><u>6v</u></a>,
        I explore the extent of the author-practitioner’s knowledge and
        understanding of artisanal techniques that he has ascribed to particular
        professions, perhaps outside his own. I focus on the way the entries
        about glassmaking speak to the extent of his expertise in professional
        glassworking practices, questioning why he may have collected these
        descriptions, what it meant for him to source raw materials from other
        artisans, and what kinds of knowledge-sharing between artisans these
        interactions may have prompted. What did the author-practitioner know
        about glass, and how was this knowledge utilized in Ms. Fr. 640?
        Ultimately, I conclude that the author-practitioner applied knowledge of
        materials, tools, and processes gained from observing other artisans to
        his own activities in the workshop.<a href="#fn6"
           class="footnote-ref"

    <h2 id="glass-in-ms.-fr.-640">Glass in Ms. Fr. 640</h2>
    <p>A survey of mentions of glass in Ms. Fr. 640 reveals that the
        author-practitioner had a high degree of familiarity with glass,
        including the tools, raw ingredients, and processes used by glassmakers
        and workers, which indicates that he visited or had access to glass
        workers or workshops.<a href="#fn7"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref7"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> To assess the impact that this
        access might have had on his experimentation, I limit my analysis to
        instances in which the author-practitioner demonstrates knowledge of
        specialized glassworking and making techniques, tools and equipment, or
        raw materials; applies the material in recipes not directly related to
        glassmaking (i.e., in the entries for painting on glass); or evinces
        knowledge of the behavior of the material when molten.<a href="#fn8"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref8"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
    <p>The multiple mentions of tools and materials used by glassmakers in the
        manuscript indicate that the author-practitioner was at least moderately
        familiar with the activities and techniques of glass workshops. In
        several disparate entries concerning other processes, he specifies the
        use of “glassworkers’ solders” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/13r/f/13r/tl"><u>13r</u></a>),
        “varnish &amp; salt &amp; other drugs that the glassworkers put on”
        (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/20r/f/20r/tl"><u>20r</u></a>),
        “glassworkers’ black” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/41v/f/41v/tl"><u>41v</u></a>),
        “crucibles… for glassmakers” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/47v/f/47v/tl"><u>47v</u></a>),
        “solder that glassworkers use” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/49r/f/49r/tl"><u>49r</u></a>),
        glass salts (<em>sel de verre</em>) (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/85r/f/85r/tl"><u>85r</u></a>),
        a “glassmaker’s <em>fournaise</em>” (fols. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/107r/f/107r/tl"><u>107r</u></a>
        and <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/120r/f/120r/tl"><u>120r</u></a>),
        and “a sand, white, like salt, and lean, that glassmakers &amp; potters
        use” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/89v/f/89v/tl"><u>89v</u></a>).
        These types of tools and materials are also common to goldsmithing and
        metalworking workshops, and they appear elsewhere in the manuscript.
        However, the deliberate designation of some tools and materials in the
        manuscript as those of the glassmakers may suggest there were
        specialized versions of more common tools that were appropriate for
        particular uses.<a href="#fn9"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref9"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> In addition, on fols. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/20r/f/20r/tl"><u>20r</u></a>,
        <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/32v/f/32v/tl"><u>32v</u></a>,
        and <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/37v/f/37v/tl"><u>37v</u></a>,
        the author-practitioner directly discusses the raw materials and
        compositions of glasses that come from different regions in Europe. This
        kind of detailed and specialized knowledge points to his familiarity
        with the profession or encounters with glass professionals.</p>
    <p>The author-practitioner also had enough familiarity with the behavior and
        qualities of vitreous material to use this knowledge to describe the
        action of other substances. Discussing latten, he states that “it always
        makes a tail, like melted glass” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/147v/f/147v/tl"><u>147v</u></a>)
        “it always leaves a tail like melted glass” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/154v/f/154v/tl"><u>154v</u></a>),
        and “it always leaves some type of tail, like glass, when you cast it”
        (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/136v/f/136v/tl"><u>136v</u></a>).
        Writing of lead, he declares that “it withstands as many castings as you
        wish, for it is as hard as glass” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/85r/f/85r/tl"><u>85r</u></a>).
        This use of glass as a material reference for the behavior of certain
        metals shows that he had at least some experience of melting, casting,
        and handling glass.</p>
    <p>The detailed discussion of the techniques on fols. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/20r/f/20r/tl"><u>20r</u></a>,
        <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/32v/f/32v/tl"><u>32v</u></a>,
        and <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/37v/f/37v/tl"><u>37v</u></a>
        also indicates some knowledge of various glassworking professions and
        their specialized products. He describes in detail the glassblowing
        processes of making sheet glass, both the plate and crown glass methods
        used in Lorraine, Flanders, and Rouen. He also describes the red sheets
        of glass that German glassmakers produced by painting a mixture of
        pewter, lead, and iron dust onto both sides of a glass pane. On fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/37v/f/37v/tl"><u>37v</u></a>
        he details the materials used by “those who discovered the invention of
        working in small works of soft enamels,” which could indicate either
        lampworkers or vitreous enamelers proper. Such descriptions are mostly
        in the third person and clearly designate the activities in question as
        those of other practitioners employed in workshops outside the
        author-practitioner’s immediate environment. This suggests that, at the
        very least, he discussed glass work with practitioners.</p>
    <p>It is likely that the author-practitioner visited glass workshops or
        retailers to purchase glass for his own use, and he may have made and
        recorded some of his observations about glassworking processes on or
        after such visits. There are fifteen entries in which the
        author-practitioner employs readymade glass as a raw material to enhance
        or improve other processes. The author practitioner would have needed to
        purchase panes of glass for his entry concerning “tracing some history
        on glass” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/39v/f/39v/tl"><u>39v</u></a>).<a
           href="#fn10"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref10"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> The entry “Glassworker” on fol.
        <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/20r/f/20r/tl"><u>20r</u></a>
        refers directly to the cost, sale, and observations about the quality of
        both Lorraine glass and plate glass from France. The former, he notes,
        is “sold by the bundle &amp; each bundle is composed of three tablets.
        The bundle costs usually x sous,” while the latter is “is sold by
        <em>paniers</em>. Every <em>panier</em> contains 24 plates that are
        commonly sold at x or twelve lb.” Such information suggests firsthand
        knowledge of the glass business.</p>
    <p>Finally, it is likely that the author-practitioner recorded his
        observations about glass with an eye to improving his own work. Several
        of the entries involving glass include brief recommendations.
        “Glassworker,” again, advises that when French plate glass is “commonly
        blown … it is better to make little diamonds rather than large square
        pieces in the shape of a frame, because they cannot be set quite evenly”
        (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/20r/f/20r/tl"><u>20r</u></a>).
        It also states that while Lorraine glass is smoother than French plate,
        “commonly it is stained by veins, in straight lines as if tanned, which
        happens because the glassmakers, having made it, put it when totally hot
        on straw, which stains it in this way.” One can, however, rub off the
        stains with some “varnish &amp; salt &amp; other drugs that the
        glassworkers put on.” “Glassworkers’ glass” on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/36v/f/36v/tl"><u>36v</u></a>
        describes how French glass “can be cleft again with the light of a
        candle by wetting, but not as precisely as with the hot iron.” Finally,
        “Glassworker” on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/37v/f/37v/tl"><u>37v</u></a>
        warns that “if the glassworker who is working has a stench from his nose
        or his mouth, &amp; he breathes on the glass, the color will not take on
        it.” In all four entries, the author-practitioner has recorded tips or
        reminders for improving glass that are specific to his own interests in
        the material. In this, he mobilizes knowledge gathered from observations
        of and experiences with other artisans, apparently in order to benefit
        his own activities.</p>
    <h2 id="for-cages">“For Cages” </h2>
    <p>Most of the entries on glassmakers and glassmaking processes describe
        glassblowing techniques that require large-scale facilities and
        specialized expertise, making them difficult to reconstruct in the
        Making and Knowing laboratory. “For cages,” a short entry that appears
        on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/6v/f/6v/tl"><u>6v</u></a>,
        however, describes a small-scale manipulation of vitreous material over
        the heat of a lamp or brazier, which was feasible to reproduce and
        allowed me to gauge the author-practitioner’s familiarity with and
        experience of glass.</p>
    <p>Some conclusions can already be drawn from an examination of the
        manuscript page. The entry on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/6v/f/6v/tl"><u>6v</u></a>
        was written in a consistent hand, likely in a single sitting. It is
        neatly laid out, with one exception: the title itself seems to have been
        revised. While <em>Pour</em> and <em>cages</em> are legible, they are
        separated by two scratched out and indecipherable words, making it
        difficult to conclude anything concrete about the author-practitioner’s
        thought process in titling.<a href="#fn11"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref11"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> Underneath the main body of the
        entry text is an image that illustrates a process for lengthening hollow
        cane in a furnace (<i><u>Fig. 1</u></i>). Unlike many of the other
        illustrations in Ms. Fr. 640, the furnace is not marginal; it is
        detailed and placed in the center of the page with plenty of space
        between the bottom of the entry and the heading of the next one. This
        suggests that the author-practitioner rendered it deliberately as part
        of the entry “For cages.” A marginal comment next to the image gives
        additional information about the functioning of the furnace.</p>

                nationale de France, Paris. The entry includes an illustration
                of a furnace supported by a grate. A glass cane and pincers pass
                through the center of the furnace. The detail suggests this
                records a furnace that the author-practitioner saw first-hand.

    <p>The neatness of the entry’s layout on the page belies some
        inconsistencies in its content. The entry is divided into two parts,
        each focused on a different method for the manipulation of “enamel
        cannules” (<em>canulles d’esmail</em>). These two parts—which represent
        two stages in the glassworking process—are out of sequence, with the
        preparatory process requiring a furnace described in the second half and
        the finishing process using the heat of a lamp for decorative work
        detailed in the first. Indeed, the first half of the entry specifically
        concerns instructions for embellishing cages with “enamel cannules of
        various colors by covering the latten or iron wire with the said
        cannules,” though what he means by cages is not immediately evident. He
        goes on to instruct: “these [canes] you will break neatly to the length
        that you want if you slightly notch with a cutting file the place to be
        broken, and they will not break at any other place. You can bend them
        with a wood model over a chafing-dish or else by the heat of the lamp.”
        This half of the entry is written in second person. The use of “one” or
        “you” to direct the reader also occurs in the glass entries on fols. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/20r/f/20r/tl"><u>20r</u></a>
        and <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/36v/f/36v/tl"><u>36v</u></a>,
        where the author-practitioner presents his instructions for how to cut
        or preserve glass to be used for <em>verre eglomisé</em>.<a href="#fn12"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref12"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> The personal tone of this half
        of the entry suggests the author-practitioner is describing an activity,
        in this case the breaking and bending of glass canes, of which he has
        firsthand experience, either as a witness or practitioner. That he
        avoids the first person, however, makes it unclear whether he has
        attempted this activity himself.</p>
    <p>The second half of the entry begins in the second person by describing
        how to prepare canes using a furnace: “it can also be drawn as long as
        you want in a small furnace made like a reverberatory furnace but which
        is pierced on both sides.” In the next sentence the author-practitioner
        switches voices to the third person:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>And when the large cannule is red, they seize the hot end using small
            pincers with a long beak, such that one prong of the beak of the
            small pincers enters inside the end of the cannule, &amp; thus it is
            lengthened without becoming stopped, &amp; the other end of the
            cannule is held with the hand, because it is not hot. When the
            cannule is stretched enough, the one who works seated, having his
            furnace the size of a carnation pot before him, breaks it off &amp;
            continues. This is for making cannules for capes, which are cut, as
            said, with a file.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>This switch from the second to third
        person suggests that the author-practitioner directly observed others
        undertake the process described. The tension between the
        author-practitioner’s use of the second and third person across this
        entry makes it unclear whether he actually attempted this work of
        embellishing cages, whether he recounts a process he witnessed, or
        whether he offers an idea for decorative work based on observations of
        glassmakers’ practices.</p>
    <p>There is one extant example of a glass-barred cage that may help
        visualize the intended outcome of the work described in “For cages.” It
        was manufactured during the sixteenth century in the glass workshop at
        the court of Archduke Ferdinand II of Tyrol between 1570 and 1590, and
        it is now in the collection of the Kunsthistorisches Museum and housed
        at Schloss Ambras (<i><u>Fig. 2</u></i>). Too delicate for practical
        use, it contains an unusual glass and papier-mâché <em>Handstein</em>
        listed in Ferdinand’s 1596 inventory as a <em>Glasberg</em>. Photographs
        of the cage led me to presume that its blue bars were made of wire
        dipped into blue glass. On a visit to Schloss Ambras in December 2017,
        however, I surmised that the cage is formed of solid canes of
        translucent dark blue enamel set, seemingly with glue, into a frame of
        wooden slats (<i><u>Fig. 3</u></i>). Inserting solid canes into a wooden
        frame with glue is a cold process and does not correspond to the
        author-practitioner’s description of “covering” wire with <em>canulles
            d’esmail</em> by the heat of a lamp. The Schloss Ambras
        <em>Glassberg</em> thus provides only a visual reference for what the
        author-practitioner intended to produce. Nevertheless, it may be
        worthwhile to explore the method of assembly used for the Ambras cage in
        a further reconstruction.</p>

                When viewed in this image, the wires that form this cage appear
                to be covered in blue enamel. Produced in Austria by an unknown

           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/6v/f/6v/tl"><u>6v</u></a>
        suggests that the author-practitioner generated the entry after
        observing practitioners in a lampworking and beadmaking workshop.
        Lampworking—a modern term that I will use throughout this essay—refers
        to the use of a naked flame to manipulate rods and tubes of colored
        glass (and even to melt them onto wire) to form small objects.<a

        lampworking are scarce. The earliest textual source on lampworking is a
        Venetian legal document from 1574, in which a glassworker describes his
        profession as that of working rods and tubes in front of a flame, but
        this gives little helpful detail.<a href="#fn14"

        translation of Antonio Neri’s (1576–1614) <em>Ars Vitraria</em>. The
        illustration included with the text shows artisans working at a table
        furnished with small oil lamps, just as Kunckel describes them (<i><u>Fig. 4</u></i>). A bellows beneath the table is attached to a
        system of tubes that transports air to the lamp’s flames, concentrating
        them to make them hot enough to soften glass rods or tubes. The artisans
        then blow through the cool end of these tubes to create bubbles of
        glass, which they manipulate with tools like pliers and looped wires to
        create “picture figures, crucifixes, small vessels; whatever you can
        conceive.”<a href="#fn15"

    <p>An important difference in terminology distinguishes Kunckel’s
        description of the “little glass blowing” from the author-practitioner’s
        “For cages” and complicates our understanding of the Ms. Fr. 640 entry
        and any reconstruction of it. While Kunckel specifies that lampworking
        is done with glass tubes and rods, in “For cages” on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/6v/f/6v/tl"><u>6v</u></a>,
        the author-practitioner does not use the word <em>verre</em>. Instead,
        his method involves the use of <em>canulles d’esmail</em>. As Amy Chang,
        Olivia Clemens, and Yuanxie Shi have shown, the author-practitioner’s
        understanding of enamel was complex and does not map neatly onto the
        traditional art-historical definition of enamel as a vitreous material
        fused to metal, ceramic, and glass at high temperatures.<a href="#fn17"
           class="footnote-ref"

           role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> In Ms. Fr. 640 the term

        may indicate another layer to the early modern understanding of glass,
        enamel, and lampworking; it also associates the author-practitioner with
        practices of sixteenth-century beadmaking. The 1573 post-mortem
        inventory of beadmaker Jehann Gourlin (d. before 1573) differentiates
        between four different kinds of lampworked glass beads, including two
        separate entries for <em>cristallin</em> and <em>émail</em>.<a

           id="fnref19"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a> As Laurier Turgeon argues, in
        the context of beadmaking during this period, the difference between the

        high quality translucent glass of the kind used to make crystal drinking
        glasses (i.e., the famous Venetian <em>cristallo</em>), while
        <em>émail</em> refers to the less expensive and lower quality opaque or
        colored glass used to make beads, prefabricated enamels, and the glass
        tubes for lampworking.<a href="#fn21"

           role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a> The author-practitioner

        where he differentiates it from common glass as “more excellent” because
        it “contains both salt of tartar &amp; saltwort all together, which both
        help fusion.”<a href="#fn23"

        understood <em>cristallin</em> as a high quality glass composed of
        specific ingredients. In addition he was familiar with the function of
        those ingredients in yielding glass of a higher clarity. This suggests
        that for the author-practitioner, in addition to traditional vitreous
        enamel and its resin imitations, <em>esmail</em> also referred to the
        low quality opaque glass used to manufacture canes for beadmaking and
        lampworking, which further situates “For cages” within the wider context
        of lampworking and beadmaking in sixteenth-century France.</p>
    <h2 id="lampworking-and-beadmaking">Lampworking and Beadmaking</h2>
    <p>The second half of the entry “For cages” seems to describe techniques
        used by lampworkers and beadmakers, two groups who were closely allied
        in the early modern period. Both beadmaking and lampworking, like so
        many other Renaissance glass technologies, arose in Italy and later
        spread across France. Beadmaking was an established trade in Venice as
        early as the thirteenth century.<a href="#fn24"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref24"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a> By 1443, French patrons were
        encouraging the emigration of glassmakers from Murano and Altare for the
        production of Venetian-style glass, known as <em>Façon de Venise</em>.<a
           href="#fn25"

           id="fnref25"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
    <p>Though these two professions arrived in France separately, by the end of
        the sixteenth century they were integrated under the same guild
        structure. Glass guilds in Italy were strictly divided according to
        product. For example, the beadmakers who produced rosary beads were
        known as <em>paternostreri</em>, whereas those who produced the smaller
        seed beads called <em>marguerites</em> were known as
        <em>margariteri</em>.<a href="#fn26"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref26"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a> The movement of knowledge from
        Italy to France, however, did not involve a simultaneous reorganization
        of the guilds to reflect the distinction. Techniques were disseminated
        by itinerant Italian glassmakers who had learned them in Murano and from
        other regions of northern Italy.<a href="#fn27"

    <p>Not only were French beadmakers and lampworkers allied under the
        glassmakers guild, but there is evidence that they were active in the
        same workshops. By 1584, two post-mortem inventories of Parisian
        beadmakers’ workshops listed lamps and bellows.<a href="#fn30"

    <p>It is likely that the author-practitioner was familiar with one of these
        workshops and its furnace. When describing the oven used for lengthening
        canes, the author-practitioner states that, “glass button makers also
        avail themselves of the said furnace” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/6v/f/6v/tl"><u>6v</u></a>).
        Significantly, buttons were one of the chief products of the beadmaking
        and lampworking industries in sixteenth-century France. “For cages” also
        includes a detailed image of the stove that provides information on both
        its design and use (Fig. 1). Given the detailed nature of the sketch, it
        is likely that the author-practitioner based it on his experience of the
        ovens used by lampworkers and beadmakers.<a href="#fn32"

    <p>The author-practitioner’s mention of a reverberatory oven suggests that
        he intended to build a glass-button maker’s furnace for himself. He
        describes the furnace as “like a reverberatory furnace but which is
        pierced on both sides” (fol. <a

        an equal spread of heat in a different kind of oven as “like the flame

        beadmakers in the sixteenth century. In lampworking, artisans followed
        the process described by Kunckel discussed above. In beadmaking, hollow
        canes were cut into small segments, which were then placed on forks and

    <p>Some French lampworkers and beadmakers made their hollow canes
        themselves. Producing hollow canes required a full-scale glasshouse
        because the process demanded a large amount of space, blowpipes, at
        least two trained glassworkers, and a large glassmakers furnace for
        fusing glass.<a href="#fn35"

           id="fnref35"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>35</sup></a> One glassworker would gather
        molten glass on the end of a hollow iron blowpipe and blow through the
        other end of the pipe to create a bubble. Another would then grasp the
        cooling glass with pincers or irons and run at a measured pace across
        the workshop, pulling the glass after him until it became too cool to be
        pulled any further. The long, thin, hollow tubes of glass could then be
        cut to the desired length.<a href="#fn36"

        the process for lengthening glass tubes by drawing them through a
        furnace that the author-practitioner describes in the second half of
        “For cages.” Late sixteenth-century beadmaking workshop inventories
        reveal that several of the thirty-seven Parisian beadmakers had the
        equipment necessary to “draw” their own glass tubes for the production
        of beads, while the rest were purchasing premade glass and enamel tubes
        from the larger glass manufactories.<a href="#fn37"

    <p>Nevertheless, there is evidence that lampworkers and beadmakers also
        obtained canes from more specialized glass manufactories. Of the tube
        remnants found at the beadmaking workshop in Rouen, though all were made
        of soda-lime silica glass, trace elements in the composition of the rods
        suggest that the workshop primarily “used oil lamps to make various
        ornaments from glass rods or tubes produced by other specialized
        shops.”<a href="#fn39"

           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/6v/f/6v/tl"><u>6v</u></a>,
        the author-practitioner explains that the process of drawing canes
        through a furnace to lengthen them is “for making cannules for capes,
        which are cut, as said, with a file.” This use solidifies the connection
        between “For cages” and French traditions of lampworking and beadmaking.
        The author-practitioner uses the word <em>cappes</em>, which Randle
        Cotgrave translates as “hooded; or, that hath a short, and capuched,
        cloake on.”<a href="#fn42"

        supplies in addition to glass and glassmaking tools. Turgeon attributes
        this to beadmakers’ increasing involvement in the clothing industry,
        prompted by the developing Renaissance fashion for embellishing clothing
        with gems, beads, and buttons.<a href="#fn43"

        it is likely that the author-practitioner witnessed the techniques
        described in “For cages” in a workshop where lampworking and beadmaking
        took place. Nevertheless, I have found no evidence that lampworkers and

    <p>Unfortunately, no French lampworked buttons, beads, figures, or jewelry

        likely that French lampworkers and beadworkers would have produced
        similar objects. In any case, the extant examples enhance the
        association between lampworking and embellishment. In 1568, Archduke
        Ferdinand II requested a Venetian lampworker with special expertise in
        the fabrication of glass chains from the Venetian government to
        manufacture jewellery for the women of the Innsbruck court.<a

        detailed. They specify that thick iron wire must be used for the
        construction of bird cages, that the cages must be made in the shape of
        a barn, lined with fabric, and constructed with a removable bottom that
        may be slid out from underneath in order to “refresh its fresh earth

        <strong>Reconstruction</strong>
    </h2>
    <p>“For cages” clearly relates to the materials, tools, techniques, and uses
        of lampworking and beadmaking in sixteenth-century France. As suggested
        above, the second half of the entry, written in the third person, seems
        to be the author-practitioner’s record of a process for lengthening
        hollow <em>canulles d’esmail</em> that he may have witnessed in a
        workshop in which lampworking and beadmaking was taking place. The first
        half of the entry seems to describe lampworking techniques, which—given
        the association between the two industries—the author-practitioner could
        have witnessed in the same workshop. While the materials and equipment
        required for the first half of the entry are clear, namely, glass and
        the heat of a lamp, the technique is opaque. The author-practitioner
        provides no detailed instruction for “covering” wire with enamel canes.
        I undertook a reconstruction in order to better elucidate the meaning of
        the first half of the entry and to explore the extent of the
        author-practitioner’s potential familiarity with lampworking
        techniques.<a href="#fn51"

    <p>It is impossible to know whether my three technique trials described
        below, though based on material evidence of historical techniques, at
        all approximate those actually used by sixteenth-century glassworkers.<a
           href="#fn52"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref52"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>52</sup></a> My reconstruction should be
        viewed as an informed exploration of the author-practitioner’s possible
        interpretation and reapplication of techniques learned from encounters
        with other artisans in the context of his own workshop practice.</p>
    <p>My reconstruction was informed by my own familiarity with the material
        and lampworking techniques. Sociologist Erin O’Connor argues that the
        development of proficiency in glassworking has two parts. First, it
        involves acquiring bodily knowledge of techniques by closely imitating
        the actions of experts. Second, it requires the development of an
        embodied understanding of the changing properties of glass as it reacts
        to heat, an understanding which can only be gained by repeated handling
        of the material.<a href="#fn53"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref53"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>53</sup></a> Having practised both
        glassblowing and lampworking from a young age, I have both an
        understanding of technique and the behavior of the material when heated.
        There is a way to feel, not just observe, when the end of a cane of
        glass will be soft enough to manipulate. This tacit knowledge informed
        my handling of the glass and how I undertook my reconstruction
        experiments.</p>
    <p>In addition, my lampworking experience informed the questions I kept in
        mind about the author-practitioner’s own material knowledge. Could he
        have used these techniques after observing them once, without the
        embodied expertise of a lampworker or beadmaker? What might have been
        the differences between the way a lampworker or beadmaker approached the
        material and the way the author-practitioner used it? Finally, I
        questioned how the extent of my material knowledge of glass might differ
        from the author-practitioner’s and how it might impact the way I
        interpreted my reconstruction. I thus developed a reconstruction that
        would examine a few ways in which the author-practitioner might have
        envisioned “covering” wire with hollow enamel canes. I conducted several
        technique trials based on uses of wire in early modern lampworking. What
        follows is a discussion of my most relevant trials.</p>
    <p>I decided to attempt to reconstruct three sixteenth-century lampworking
        techniques for adhering glass to wire known from object sources:
        building, lamp-winding, and embedding. Building is a term I am using to
        designate a technique found in the objects from Innsbruck and later
        described by Denis Diderot (1713–1719) in the 1759 <em>Encyclopédie, ou
            Dictionnaire raisonné des sciences, des arts, et des métiers</em>,
        which involves melting hot glass onto a wire armature. In lamp-winding,
        the glassworker winds heated glass around an iron wire to form a spiral
        bead or a bead with rounded edges.<a href="#fn54"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref54"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>54</sup></a> Finally, research into early
        seventeenth-century figurines from Nevers has revealed that they were
        made with copper wires embedded in rods of glass, a way of combining
        glass and wire that I have called “embedding.”<a href="#fn55"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref55"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>55</sup></a></p>
    <p>My first trial was based on a technique in which glass is built onto a
        wire armature. This sixteenth-century method of fusing wire and glass
        can be seen in the objects from Ferdinand II’s glass workshop. The trees
        on the <em>Glasberg</em> inside the cage discussed earlier seem to be
        fused directly to the ends of thin wires (Fig. 2). In addition, the ball
        on which the statue of Fortuna stands in Fig. 6 is impaled on a thick
        iron wire, which likely extends up through the figure as a wire
        armature. The use of wire armatures in the eighteenth century is
        evidenced in Diderot’s <em>Encyclopédie</em>:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>If the enameller plans to make a human or animal figure that is solid
            and of some height, he begins by forming a small structure of brass
            wire; he gives this small structure the general shape of the limbs
            of the figure for which it will serve as a support. He takes the
            structure in one hand and a baguette of solid enamel in the other:
            he exposes the enamel to the lamp; and when it is sufficiently
            fused, he attaches it to his brass wire, on which he models it…<a

    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>In all these cases, glass is fused
        directly onto wire and built up into various forms.<a href="#fn57"

           role="doc-noteref"><sup>57</sup></a></p>
    <p>My second trial followed the technique of lamp-winding. Similar to the
        standard methods that lampworkers use to form beads today, lamp-wound
        beads were made by heating the ends of glass canes with a lamp until
        they reached a sufficient temperature to wind around an iron wire to
        form a spiral or a bead with rounded edges.<a href="#fn58"

    <p>The third trial was inspired by the practice of embedding threadlike
        copper wires in cane figurines. This technique was revealed by
        radiograph scans done on eleven eighteenth-century Nevers figurines in
        the Robert Lehman Collection at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.<a

    <p>I was not able to combine glass and wire in a way that seemed suitable
        for ornamenting a cage until I abandoned my attempts to reproduce period
        techniques and attempted a more literal interpretation of the recipe.
        The only instruction that the author-practitioner gives for combining
        cane and wire is that “you can embellish them with enamel cannules of
        various colors by covering the latten or iron wire with the said
        cannules.” Using a tube of glass with wire inserted, I heated it at one
        point in the middle of the cane until the glass was malleable. Then,
        holding the cane in my hands at either end, I bent it into a near
        seventy-degree angle (<i><u>Fig. 14</u></i>). When I removed the cane
        from the heat and let the glass cool, the wire and glass were stable.
        While the glass was not completely fused to the wire, the bend prevented
        it from slipping out of the glass.</p>

    <p>My experience with the reconstruction raises some interesting points for
        consideration. In my first three trials, which imitated period
        lampworking techniques, I found fusing glass to wire and then bending
        them together difficult even with my prior knowledge of the material. I
        found, however, that the more trials I completed, the easier it became.
        Without a great deal of practice, it would be extremely difficult to
        produce an embellished cage that was structurally sound. This suggests,
        as Erin O’Connor argues, that a certain amount of technical and material
        knowledge must be built up through practice before these processes can
        be completed successfully. It is improbable that the author-practitioner
        would have been able to undertake these techniques without significant
        practice in lampworking.</p>
    <p>The technique that proved most successful for the task of fusing and then
        bending wire and glass was not directly based on a known historical
        technique. Rather, it developed only when I attempted a more
        straightforward reading of the recipe. Unlike my first three trials,
        this process was easy and intuitive, though it is not clear whether this
        was due to the nature of the process itself or to my growing experience
        with the particularities of fusing and bending glass and wire in the
        lab. It seems possible that someone might be able to reproduce this
        technique from observation alone. Alternatively, the ease with which I
        was able to bend the wire and glass using this method suggested to me
        that the author-practitioner could have developed it himself.</p>
    <p>Ultimately, my reconstruction remains inconclusive. While the materials
        (hollow <em>canulles d’esmail</em>) and tools (lamp and furnace) used in
        “For cages” relate to lampworking and beadmaking, I found no direct
        precedent for the processes the author-practitioner describes of
        covering wire and lengthening canes. In addition, there is no evidence
        that French lampworkers and beadmakers were engaged in the manufacture
        of embellished cages. There might, of course, be records of processes of
        which I am unaware. The combination of my experience with the
        reconstruction and my research into sixteenth-century lampworking and
        beadmaking techniques leads me to speculate that “For cages” is the
        author-practitioner’s attempt to replicate several tools, materials, and
        processes he observed in a lampworking workshop in the service of his
        own idea: a decorated cage. It is also possible, however, that the entry
        describes an attempt to directly imitate a process of manufacturing an
        embellished cage that the author-practitioner witnessed.</p>
    <p>In either case, in light of the general context of glass in Ms. Fr. 640,
        “For cages” can be read as evidence that the author-practitioner
        informed his own activities with technical knowledge that he gained from
        observing a lampworking and beadmaking workshop. While it is impossible
        to know whether the author-practitioner actually visited a beadmaking
        workshop and observed other artisans or if he followed this recipe to
        produce cages embellished with <em>canulles d’esmail</em>, my
        reconstruction and research raised several questions for further
        pursuit. Why might the author-practitioner have included such scant
        instructions for how to cover canes in glass and such detailed
        instructions for how to lengthen cane? To what extent was his execution
        of these techniques informed by his knowledge of other techniques and
        materials from outside lampworking and beadmaking? A closer analysis of
        the other entries featuring glass and enamel in Ms. Fr. 640, perhaps
        paired with comparative reconstructions of both “For cages” and the
        author-practitioner’s entries concerning heat-processed vitreous
        enamels, would help to address these questions.</p>
    <p>A thorough study of the author-practitioner’s use of different voices
        throughout the manuscript might be used to determine a pattern of his
        practice of observation. In what contexts does he use the first, second,
        and third person, and what does that suggest about the way he gathered
        and employed technical knowledge? In addition, deeper research into the
        glassmaking and beadmaking industries in Toulouse might clarify the
        relationship that the author-practitioner could have had to these
        artisans. How was glass retailed as a raw material? Did glassmakers sell
        premade glass from their workshops? At markets? More research on this
        topic might reveal other avenues of knowledge exchange between artisans
        working in different materials. Expanding these contextual questions
        through research on and reconstructions of Ms. Fr. 640 entries
        concerning other trades such as carpentry or metalworking would better
        situate the author-practitioner within networks of artisanal knowledge
        exchange in sixteenth-century France.</p>

                <p>Similar arguments about the dissemination of workshop
                    knowledge have been made about the Italian context. On
                    Murano, many full-scale glass workshops were included in
                    tours of the city and open to visitors, aristocratic and
                    artisanal alike. I have yet to find any evidence of this

                    author-practitioner uses <em>esmail</em> and the inventory
                    uses <em>email,</em> Randle Cotgrave’s 1611 French-English
                    dictionary translates both as: “Ammell, or Enamell; Ammell,
                    or enamel (is made of glasse, and metals).” This indicates
                    that the spelling discrepancy between Ms. Fr. 640 and
                    Gourlin’s contemporary inventory is probably
                    inconsequential. See Randle Cotgrave, <em>A Dictionarie of

                <p>For my reconstruction, I reproduced a version of this furnace
                    informed by the author-practitioner’s diagram, research into
                    period furnaces, and research internal to Ms. Fr. 640 and
                    the author-practitioner’s knowledge of furnaces in general.
                    Despite some differences in design (i.e., the use of a
                    blowtorch instead of charcoal as a heat source) my furnace
                    worked similarly to the one described in the entry. I was
                    able to lengthen a hollow cane by drawing it through a hole
                    made through the body of the furnace while observing the
                    glass’s color through the opening in the top to assess its
                    temperature as it heated. Ana Matisse Donefer-Hickie,

                <p>For example, glass artist William Gudenrath at the Corning
                    Museum of Glass has reverse engineered the processes used to
                    produce several Renaissance Venetian forms (including some
                    lampworking) by combining his training with a close
                    examination of sixteenth-century objects. His process,
                    however, differs markedly from that used in
                    sixteenth-century Muranese furnaces: he works alone, whereas
                    the Muranese have a long tradition of working in closely
                    choreographed teams. His experiments have been published

                <p>To approximate the heat from a lamp or brazier, I used a
                    T4000 Bernzomatic Propane Torch, set to a temperature of
                    between 600 and 800°C, set up under a fume hood. I used
                    clear hollow soda-lime silica glass tubes that were
                    manufactured by Anna Elizabeth Riley at the glass workshop
                    at the Rhode Island School of Design. Finally, I also used
                    an 18-gauge non-tarnish brass wire to approximate the
                    author-practitioner’s wire made of latten, which in the
                    sixteenth century was an alloy of disputed composition that

                <p>I found fusing glass directly onto wire particularly
                    difficult, and ultimately the glass did not stick uniformly.
                    From experience, I knew that in order to adhere the glass to
                    the metal, both had to be quite hot. Heating both the glass
                    and the wire in the small flame at the same time was
                    difficult because the wire heated at a much faster rate than
                    the glass. While both were hot, the glass stuck well to the
                    wire. As both materials cooled at different rates, however,
                    the glass started to come off the wire. Once the wire had a
                    layer of glass, I directed the flame to one section of glass
                    and wire and attempted to bend it, as the
                    author-practitioner suggests. While the wire bent easily
                    (since it was flexible even when cold), the glass had to be
                    very hot to bend with the wire. After I let my trial cool to
                    the touch, however, the bond between glass and wire became
                    very unstable. Some of the glass stayed fused to the wire,
                    but several pieces fell off. Donefer-Hickie, “Annotation -

                <p>The directed heat needed for lamp-winding made this technique
                    even more difficult than attempting to build glass along the
                    length of the wire. Again, to wind the glass around the
                    wire, I had to heat the wire and the glass at the same time.
                    However, getting the glass and wire hot enough while
                    simultaneously winding the glass around the wire was very
                    difficult. The wire kept getting too hot and melting off
                    into pieces. In the end, I was left with several pieces of
                    wire topped with glass lumps and a few wires dotted with
                    glass beads. The wire and glass combination seemed too
                    delicate for me to attempt bending it. Donefer-Hickie,

                    240–54. The glass cracked several times during my
                    reconstruction. To embed the wire in my glass, I inserted it
                    into the hollow tube. Then, in an attempt to fuse the glass
                    to the wire, I heated the hollow cane in a direct flame.
                    When heated simultaneously in this way, however, the
                    difference between the rate at which glass and wire heat
                    prevented a smooth fusion of glass to wire. The wire heated
                    much more quickly than the glass encasing it. While I did
                    manage to partly fuse the glass to the wire at the very end
                    of the tube, the glass cracked and fell off the wire in
                    several places. Donefer-Hickie, “Annotation - ForCagesFa16,”
