        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <div>
            <p>This essay reflects philosophically on how the Making and Knowing
                Project engages with Ms. Fr. 640 to gain insight into artisanal
                epistemology. I draw a distinction between “virtual” and
                “concrete” modes of investigating the manuscript before arguing
                that it should be studied using both modes in an interwoven
                manner. I track the problematic virtual/concrete distinction
                through some recent scholarship, and I suggest that texts like
                Ms. Fr. 640, which combine records of craft practice with
                evidence of engagement in those practices, call for a
                reevaluation of epistemological categories such as propositional
                and practical knowledge in order to better understand artisanal
                ways of knowing.</p>

    <h2 id="how-to-study-texts">How to Study Texts</h2>
    <p>One intuitive way to understand texts that form coherent “books” involves
        seeing them as physical objects that encode information through
        linguistic representation. If this description is plausible, then
        scholars are entitled to treat manuscript texts such as BnF Ms. Fr. 640
        as descriptions of craft practices that can be mined for information,
        both processual and historical or contextual, about those practices. The
        manuscript seems to be at once a cultural artifact of a particular time
        and a text that can be “read for meaning” more generally, which suggests
        that it admits of research methodologies appropriate to both dimensions
        of its identity. Setting aside questions of the genre categorization of
        the manuscript, this broad characterization is already misleading,
        since, as Adrian Wilson points out, textuality is generated by a
        readerly process consisting in an abstraction of “verbal content [that]
        is assigned the quality of reality, independent of its material
        embodiment and from the setting of action in which it arose.”<a
           href="#fn1"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref1"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> For Wilson, as for other scholars
        writing in the postmodern mode of textual and authorial critique, there
        is an unbridgeable gap between the inevitably interpretive efforts of
        text-based scholarship and the “truth” that is sometimes presumed to
        reside in the objects supporting the texts in question. For the purposes
        of this essay, I will draw a distinction between <em>virtual</em> and
        <em>concrete</em> modes of engagement with works like Ms. Fr. 640. I
        take virtual modes to capture the textual situation described by Wilson,
        whereas concrete modes refer to various methods of approaching works in
        the “setting of action in which [they] arose.”<a href="#fn2"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref2"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> Recipe reconstruction is one such
        mode of study.</p>
    <p>If Wilson is right, the relationship between virtual and concrete modes
        of investigation is a fraught one. His observation seemingly calls into
        question the unity and transferability of claims made about either way
        of looking at a work. We therefore face an epistemological problem: how
        can the study of Ms. Fr. 640 yield <em>knowledge about</em> the
        <em>knowledge generated by</em> the historical practices it describes?
        What kinds of knowledge can be gleaned from examining the manuscript
        virtually—in terms of its verbal content—as opposed to concretely? Do
        the two apparently distinct modes of engagement produce distinct bodies
        of knowledge? If so, are we justified in treating those bodies of
        knowledge as unified, continuous, or otherwise interpenetrating? If not,
        what is the relationship between the two kinds of knowledge, and how can
        we travel from one to the next while retaining a solid theoretical
        foundation? This range of problems is far from new; in fact, facing such
        concerns head-on puts us in the company of many historical actors who
        “paradoxically declared <em>in writing</em> that writing was inadequate
        to convey their skills, and that book learning was inferior to bodily
        experience.”<a href="#fn3"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref3"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
    <p>The members of the Making and Knowing Project are already invested in the
        continuity of these two bodies of knowledge. The Project’s investment is
        reflected in the following passage from the “About” section of the
        Making and Knowing website:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>through the Project’s transcription, English translation, and
            encoding of the text, the edition will present the text of Fr. 640
            in a searchable digital format in both French and English
            translation for the first time. The critical apparatus (including
            multimedia annotations, essay-length analyses of techniques and
            materials, a glossary of technical terms, and a list of resources
            for further exploration) will situate the manuscript’s contents
            within the material and historical context in which they were
            produced. The Project hopes to engage readers, whether researchers,
            students, or the broader public, in a new approach to exploring
            historical texts, one which emphasizes the importance of the
            material conditions, interpretations, and outcomes that emerge when
            the written word is realized through investigations into matter.<a

               role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>In its emphasis upon the epistemic
        benefits of establishing a continuity between content, materiality,
        context, and laboratory reconstructive efforts, the above excerpt brings
        to light the need for a philosophical examination of the sort I
        undertake in this essay. In what follows, I seek to show first that it
        is reasonable to approach Ms. Fr. 640 in both virtual and concrete modes
        of investigation. Indeed, Ms. Fr. 640 complicates the distinction
        because of certain elements of its construction, apparent use, and
        possible purpose. Nevertheless, it is useful to maintain a distinction
        between virtual and concrete modes because doing so allows us to gain
        insight into the challenging project of clarifying the kinds of
        knowledge that works like this manuscript produce.</p>
    <h2 id="what-is-knowledge-in-ms.-fr.-640">What is Knowledge in Ms. Fr. 640
    </h2>
    <p>The second half of this essay aims to establish that the existing
        literature on works comparable to Ms. Fr. 640 already engages both
        virtual and concrete strategies, albeit in an entangled way. This state
        of affairs muddies efforts to determine the kind of knowledge these
        texts (and the practices they describe) create, even as valuable
        insights and observations are generated. I suggest that the application
        of distinctions like the virtual/concrete framework can assist scholars
        in sorting through these insights to gain clarity about how to
        categorize, understand, or even simply describe the types of knowledge
        under consideration. While this essay can only gesture towards an answer
        to those ultimate questions, I think progress can be made by considering
        Ms. Fr. 640 in light of examples from epistemic genres such as the
        encyclopedia, the miscellany, books of secrets, recipe collections, and
        collections of objects known as <em>Kunstkammern</em>. This essay
        contributes to the immediate purpose of investigating Ms. Fr. 640 by
        showing that the manuscript can be understood as existing within and
        between the genres introduced above.<a href="#fn5"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref5"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> In so doing, I hope to go part of
        the way toward a philosophical justification of the continuity of the
        bodies of knowledge we get from studying the manuscript in both virtual
        and concrete scholarly modes. Further, I think this characterization of
        Ms. Fr. 640 underscores the need to develop more complicated epistemic
        categories than the “knowledge-how,” “knowledge-that,” and
        “knowledge-why” which pervade the history of philosophy and contemporary
        epistemology.</p>
    <p>Let me take a moment to explain what I mean by “knowledge-how,”
        “knowledge-that,” and “knowledge-why.” Philosophers who study and
        theorize about knowledge—called epistemologists—frequently describe
        knowledge in terms of these three categories, although it is certainly
        possible to challenge this taxonomy. “Knowledge-how” is usually taken to
        be the kind of practical knowledge involved in knowing how to do
        something, while “knowledge-that” refers to propositional knowledge of
        the form “x knows that p” (for instance, I have propositional knowledge
        when I know that Columbia University is in the city of New York).<a
           href="#fn6"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref6"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> “Knowledge-why,” or causal
        knowledge, means knowing how it is that something is the case. Since
        “knowledge-why” can be reformulated in propositional terms, some
        philosophers take it to be reducible to “knowledge-that.” For the
        purposes of this essay, I will assume that knowledge of causes is also
        propositional knowledge.<a href="#fn7"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref7"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
    <p>It is worth noting that the history of western philosophy has generally
        treated “knowledge-how,” associated with the category of
        <em>techne</em>, as inferior to propositional knowledge, which is
        associated with <em>episteme</em> or <em>scientia</em>, regarded as
        knowledge of greater certainty. This tradition traces back to Plato and
        Socrates, influencing the development of modern epistemology through the
        Aristotelian inheritance in European thought, and continuing to affect
        contemporary text-based scholarship. Even if text-based scholars do not
        elevate propositional knowledge for principled reasons, they do so at
        least because accepted methodology requires propositional expression for
        the sake of linguistic communication.<a href="#fn8"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref8"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> The following essay considers the
        possibility that assuming a strong distinction between propositional and
        practical knowledge, combined with the pervasive idea that a hierarchy
        exists between them, precludes thorough readings of texts like Ms. Fr.
        640. It may be the case that these works require scholars to look for
        other ways of classifying knowledge. In this respect, I follow Pamela H.
        Smith and other authors in calling for a more expansive way of thinking
        about artisanal epistemology.</p>

        Establishing the Framework: Virtual and Concrete Modes of Engagement
    </h2>
    <p>In his essay “What is a text?,” Adrian Wilson extends the postmodern
        critique of authorship to a problematization of textuality (primarily as
        it pertains to written works, although the theory should be as flexible
        as the concept of “text” itself).<a href="#fn9"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref9"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> Wilson introduces the notion of a
        <em>virtual author</em> to capture the way in which “the creator of a
        given text becomes abstracted into a virtual individual who is read in
        that text, who is constructed by the reader. The virtual author is a
        projection of the act of reading.”<a href="#fn10"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref10"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> The author, in this sense, is
        abstracted from the historical person who produced the work in question;
        unlike the real Aristotle, for instance, who has been dead for millenia,
        it makes sense to say of the virtual Aristotle that he writes, speaks,
        contests, and means things in the present tense. Through the act of
        reading, readers interact with virtual authors between the present and
        the historical past, establishing interpretive ground that might be
        termed “the past-as-present in our culture.”<a href="#fn11"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref11"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> Similarly, Wilson argues, the
        new use of “text” makes visible—but does not invent—the way in which
        works themselves are abstracted through the act of reading, becoming
        “timeless objects” supported by their material substrates but not
        necessarily identical to or dependent upon them.<a href="#fn12"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref12"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> Indeed, according to Wilson,
        readers can never approach works as texts without triggering this
        projective move.<a href="#fn13"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref13"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> While texts have material
        embodiments that can be reproduced in some sense, “this is always, and
        necessarily, a <em>new</em> material form” that stands apart from the
        text itself, which is virtual and timeless.<a href="#fn14"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref14"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> There always arises a gap
        between the textual content of a work and the object that embodies it.
        Consider the way in which translations, transcriptions, and
        modernizations can be thought to instantiate the same text—as is the
        case with the digital critical edition of Ms. Fr. 640. I will borrow
        Wilson’s lexicon of virtuality to describe these textual modes of
        engaging with and/or investigating works.</p>
    <p>Wilson’s account is appealing, in part, because it captures the way we
        engage with texts as generative fonts of insights of various kinds and
        feel ourselves able to meet works in our present moment in ways that are
        not hopelessly skeptical in nature. I am not suggesting that all texts
        are ahistorical or are read ahistorically—knowledge about the past
        inflects, and sometimes determines, the way meaning is interpreted in
        the present. However, as Wilson illuminates, there seems to be a serious
        sense in which engaging with a work in a virtual manner renders elusive
        a simultaneous engagement with it as a “mere thing.” The “thingness” of
        a work encompasses both its artifactual materiality and (in Wilson’s
        terms) the “setting of action” in which the work was created. Either or
        both of these aspects of a work’s thingness could be called up by the
        terminology of <em>concrete</em> engagement, but for the purposes of
        this essay I will use it primarily in the latter sense. For Ms. Fr. 640,
        the “setting of action” I have in mind concerns the context of the
        workshop or other physical locus of artisanal practice. As we will soon
        see, there is evidence to suggest that the author-practitioner of Ms.
        Fr. 640 actually executed recipes contained in the manuscript (hence the
        decision to refer to him as “author-practitioner” rather than “author”),
        giving us reason to include the workshop as part of the “setting of
        action” in need of investigation.</p>
    <p>At this point, a puzzle appears: if a work can be encountered either
        virtually or concretely, how can we learn about something as a concrete
        object while simultaneously approaching it as a virtual text? This
        problem is difficult to solve if we follow a naive reading of Wilson as
        establishing a sharp distinction between textuality and objecthood. I
        take it, though, that Wilson does not mean to deny what we might call a
        “dual citizenship” of historical artifacts as both virtual texts and
        concrete objects.<a href="#fn15"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref15"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> Instead, he calls for
        interpreters to take the projected nature of a given text into account
        in order to face the ineluctable constructive power of textual scholarly
        engagement. We should therefore think critically before assuming that
        concrete engagement can be integrated thoroughly into, or even
        undertaken within, text-based projects. Further justification seems to
        be required.</p>
    <p>Ms. Fr. 640 draws out the import of this critique because it feels so
        natural to study the work through its virtual as well as concrete
        dimensions. One key example of a concrete engagement with the manuscript
        consists in the reconstructive work undertaken by the Making and Knowing
        Project. As Pamela H. Smith and the Making and Knowing Project
        discovered during their investigation of Ms. Fr. 640, a straightforward
        reading of the manuscript was in any case not possible because it is not
        a linear text… Indeed, it became clear to us that ‘reading’ the text for
        understanding in fact meant reconstructing the actions described in
        it.”<a href="#fn16"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref16"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> This statement indicates the
        limitations of virtual engagement in the case of the manuscript, but it
        also reveals the Project’s commitment to treating concrete engagement
        with Ms. Fr. 640 as a way of tackling interpretive angles—such as
        reading—which are frequently taken to be virtual. While authors like
        Hasok Chang and Dietmar Höttecke have argued convincingly that scholars
        can learn about historical experimental processes by reconstructing
        those experiments, I think it is worth asking whether the dual
        citizenship posited earlier justifies studying Ms. Fr. 640 in such a
        flexible manner<em>.</em><a href="#fn17"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref17"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> In other words, we might worry
        that dual citizenship gets us only so far. Perhaps it simply justifies
        studying the manuscript as a virtual projection through tools such as
        the transcription, translation, and metadata available in the Digital
        Critical Edition while reserving concrete modes of engagement (like
        recipe reconstruction) for the separate project of studying Ms. Fr. 640
        as a repository of craft practice. However, the Making and Knowing
        Project surpasses this by arguing that recipe reconstruction contributes
        directly to the supposedly virtual toolkit brought to bear on the
        manuscript. The Project has found, for instance, that translation is
        aided by the practical experience occasioned by concrete investigation.
        This calls for a conception of dual citizenship that renders Ms. Fr. 640
        simultaneously and fluidly amenable to virtual and concrete modes of
        study.</p>
    <p>We can justify this fluidity by considering the way that any artifactual
        incarnation of Ms. Fr. 640 embodies its meaning (to borrow a term from
        the philosophy of art), not as “the original” embodiment of the text by
        virtue of its status as a manuscript bearing the hand of its anonymous
        author-practitioner, but thanks to the epistemic context evoked by its
        structure and certain clues we have to its means and purpose of
        composition.<a href="#fn18"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref18"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> This is to say that evidence of
        the manuscript’s use(s) and possible purpose(s) lends credence to
        understanding it under the stronger version of dual citizenship just
        described. The stronger form of dual citizenship then reinforces the
        tenability of using concrete methodologies to “read” Ms. Fr. 640. The
        upsides seem clear: concrete modes of research aim to capture the kind
        of embodied engagement with which the author-practitioner—or some other
        possible user of Ms. Fr. 640—would have “met” the manuscript as not only
        a record of artisanal experience, but also as a kind of contestant and
        tool in craft processes. While undertaking recipe reconstruction, for
        instance, cannot provide a distortionless view into even one’s lab
        partner’s phenomenological reality (let alone that of the
        author-practitioner!), it nevertheless allows us to approach the tacit
        and embodied knowledge upon which the author-practitioner relied. Since
        such knowledge is so hard to express in words, it is not clear that it
        could ever be apprehended through virtual means alone.</p>
    <p>Taking inventory of some of the ways in which Ms. Fr. 640 embodies its
        meaning involves looking for instances in which information about the
        manuscript’s use and/or creation is encoded non-propositionally.
        Consider the cliché of showing rather than telling: studying the way Ms.
        Fr. 640 embodies its meaning has to do with what the manuscript
        <em>shows</em> us instead of what the author-practitioner <em>tells</em>
        us. Ms. Fr. 640 consists of 171 folios written in eight different
        scripts, suggesting a degree of revision and re-visitation. In some
        places, the main hand of the author-practitioner adds notes in the
        margins or advises against using certain recipes, which may indicate
        personal experience with the processes included in the compilation.
        While the manuscript resembles a formal recipe collection and was
        originally bound under a title indicating it as such, it stands apart
        from most extant examples of books of secrets in that its author and
        compiler used it as a site of reflexive negotiation and a companion in
        practice. Other books of secrets, such as the <em>Secrets</em> of
        Alessio Piemontese (1555), declare authorial expertise; still others,
        like Hugh Plat’s <em>The Jewell House of Art and Nature</em> (1594), at
        least occasionally make use of attributions to assure readers of the
        validity of the information held within.<a href="#fn19"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref19"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a> In contrast, the
        author-practitioner of Ms. Fr. 640 neither trumpets his own mastery of
        artifice through rhetorical flourishes nor grounds the trustworthiness
        of his recipes in others’ epistemic respectability. His reliability as a
        practitioner is <em>embodied</em> in the way he composed, and probably
        used, the text he was engaged in writing. As Pamela H. Smith notices,
        “it would appear that the composition of the manuscript itself could not
        be divorced from the lived experience of actually performing the
        actions.”<a href="#fn20"

    <p>Due to this distinctive feature of Ms. Fr. 640, I think we are justified
        in attributing to it the stronger form of dual citizenship I outlined
        above. As a result, it makes sense to weave together the virtual and
        concrete modes of investigation in the vein characteristic of the Making
        and Knowing Project. If this is plausible, it might seem tempting to do
        away with the virtual/concrete distinction altogether, sidestepping
        Wilson’s critique and rendering moot the preoccupations of this essay.
        However, I think it is useful to preserve the distinction, at least
        insofar as it helps clarify the kind of knowledge that is produced by
        craft practices. To be more precise, I argue in the next section of this
        essay that a lack of direct attention to the virtual/concrete
        distinction leads interpreters of texts like Ms. Fr. 640 to alternate
        between casting the texts and practices under examination as productive
        of either propositional or practical knowledge. This piecemeal approach,
        although technically appropriate on account of the dual citizenship of
        Ms. Fr. 640, obscures the deep entanglement of the knowledge-concepts
        inherent in the text. A closer look may reveal that the knowledge
        produced by Ms. Fr. 640 consistently defies binaries such as the
        practical and the propositional, the encyclopedic and the miscellaneous,
        and the virtual and the concrete.</p>
    <h2 id="the-virtualconcrete-distinction-in-context">The Virtual/Concrete
        Distinction in Context</h2>
    <p>The Making and Knowing Project has posited a small series of productive
        genre comparisons for Ms. Fr. 640, the strongest of which is with books
        of secrets. Reading the manuscript for its affinities with books of
        secrets inserts it into a tradition which began during the Middle Ages
        and continued to rise in prominence and popularity throughout early
        modern Europe.<a href="#fn21"

        two constitute distinct genres is perhaps a matter for debate. Further,
        the manuscript contains recipes for many objects which would have
        populated <em>Kunstkammern</em>, or collections that combined natural
        objects and objects made through human artifice. I use examples of
        literature concerned with each of these relevant forms to frame the
        epistemological issues that will occupy the remainder of this essay.</p>
    <p>Lest readers be concerned that the concrete/virtual distinction I have
        drawn in the first half of this essay is arbitrary or constructed, it is
        worth looking at several examples of scholarship that voice concerns
        about engaging with texts like Ms. Fr. 640 in a wholly virtual way. In
        their study of the relationship between artifacts and their digital
        surrogates in librarianship, Robbyn Gordon Lanning and Jonathan B.
        Bengston note the difficulty of trying “to capture, without engaging
        directly with the objects, ... the sense of how they were intended to be
        used by their creators,” suggesting that an important dimension of
        working with rare resources can be undermined by digitizations that do
        not take concrete engagement into consideration.<a href="#fn23"

        women’s culinary recipe books in early modern England resonates with my

    <blockquote>
        <p>it is the practical possibilities of the written recipe which locate
            [it] outside literary parameters. The practitioner would become a
            recipe’s author and owner for the moment, but this authorial
            relationship was only temporary—the perception of involvement, of

    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>It is reasonable to read Pennell’s
        “literary parameters” as a rough stand-in for the conventions of virtual
        engagement that Wilson identifies. Crucially, Pennell expresses the way
        in which virtual engagement with what she terms “texts of action”
        accounts only partially for the “intimacy with the methods and media of
        production,” the understanding of which Pamela H. Smith links to
        reconstruction processes.<a href="#fn25"

        examples shows how the desire for something along the lines of concrete
        engagement has been registered in the relevant literature.</p>
    <p>Two other examples, both drawn from Elaine Leong and Alisha Rankin’s
        edited volume on knowledge and books of secrets, illustrate how inchoate
        instances of this distinction in the existing literature can shed light
        on the epistemological challenge of dealing with texts like Ms. Fr. 640.
        The authors I will discuss seem to value both concrete and virtual modes
        of engagement with books of secrets, but they do not look closely at the
        implications of those methodologies or the different epistemological
        frameworks they invoke. Instead, they vacillate between framing books of
        secrets through these different modes, making it possible to conceive of
        the texts under study as exemplars of either practical or propositional
        knowledge depending on the approach at hand. (To see why this might be
        the case, it is helpful to notice that virtual engagement frequently
        leads to the production of propositional claims, while concrete
        engagement yields increased interest in the practical knowledge of
        historical actors.) Ms. Fr. 640 problematizes these binaries, however,
        and in so doing ultimately undermines the validity of the distinctions I
        employ. In this respect, the distinctions are just foils, albeit useful
        ones for uncovering what is at stake in approaching the manuscript as
        the Making and Knowing Project does.</p>
    <p>In the introduction to their volume, Leong and Rankin call upon both
        propositional and practical knowledge without interrogating or
        explaining those categories. Moreover, as editors, they mix and match
        the results of concrete and virtual engagement in a way that presupposes
        at least some epistemological continuity between the categories. They
        write that “hunting for secrets was one [way]... early modern men and
        women attempted to satisfy their desire to understand the natural
        world,” suggesting that books of secrets preserve or compile
        propositional knowledge about nature—knowledge-<em>that</em> the world
        works in such-and-such a way.<a href="#fn27"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref27"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a> When they turn to scholarship on
        books of secrets that emphasizes the importance of craft traditions,
        Leong and Rankin state that the “movement focusing on” those traditions
        “examines the role of artisanal ‘know-how,’” which corresponds to
        practical knowledge.<a href="#fn28"

        obvious, however, that artisanal epistemology can comfortably be
        characterized as knowledge-how. Pamela H. Smith, for one, has argued for
        the “investigative and philosophical” valences of practice and artisanal
        knowledge.<a href="#fn29"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref29"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a> I do not think that Leong and
        Rankin would challenge this claim in its entirety, since one of the
        chapters of the volume in question—written by Smith—concerns the
        potentially propositional aspects of artisanal epistemology. Perhaps,
        then, tracking the distinctions between concrete and virtual engagement
        with texts, as well as propositional and practical knowledge, are not
        primary concerns for Rankin and Leong. Thus, while their treatment
        brings out important ways of thinking about particular texts, it does
        not yet help us close in on the question of how to theorize the kinds of
        knowledge produced by artisanal practice.</p>
    <p>William Eamon’s contribution to the Leong and Rankin volume draws out
        still further ambiguities in the realm of craft epistemology as it
        relates to books of secrets. According to Eamon, “books of secrets… gave
        readers the assurance that nature was predictable and that craft and
        professional secrets were not beyond their ken.”<a href="#fn30"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref30"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a> At the same time, Eamon and the
        volume’s editors emphasize the particularity of the knowledge associated
        with books of secrets. Leong and Rankin describe secrets as “little bits
        of information” which “played a central role in producing and sharing
        knowledge in early modern Europe,” while Eamon recommends that scholars
        of books of secrets spend more time “pouring through [sic]” the volumes
        to “look closer at the particulars.”<a href="#fn31"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref31"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a> This dynamic between
        generalizability and particularity is interesting for two reasons.
        First, it may partly align books of secrets with the new philosophy and
        its aims to found generalizable truths about nature on particular
        experiences and observations, underscoring the possibility that the
        artisanal practices the books describe could be philosophical. Second,
        it brings together elements of two streams in the Renaissance conception
        of knowledge which often seem to oppose one another: namely, the
        encyclopedic and miscellaneous traditions.</p>
    <p>Neil Kenny’s analysis of these two forms in <em>The Palace of Secrets:
            Béroalde de Verville and Renaissance Conceptions of Knowledge</em>
        will help us understand how Eamon, Leong, and Rankin provide support for
        a more expansive conception of the kind of knowledge produced by craft
        practices. Kenny in fact frames “Renaissance philosophical writing” as
        encompassing three basic structures.<a href="#fn32"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref32"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a> As he writes,</p>

            ways; and thirdly, some philosophical fictions hover ambivalently

    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>According to Kenny, encyclopedism is
        characterized by its values of systematicity and necessity; encyclopedic

            form a circle of learning. The structure of the circle is held to be

    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>Kenny posits that palaces and
        cabinets—including <em>Kunstkammern</em>—resemble the circle as
        metaphors for perfect encyclopedic knowledge. It is worth noting,
        however, that Kenny’s casting of <em>Kunstkammern</em> as encyclopedic
        is contested among scholars who see the cabinets as unsystematic
        groupings of whatever struck the fancy of the collectors in question.<a

    <p>Since it seems clear that books of secrets are not philosophical
        fictions, only two of Kenny’s categories might apply: the encyclopedia
        and the miscellany. As we have seen, Kenny connects encyclopedias to
        systematic bodies of necessary knowledge. He clearly acknowledges that
        forms of knowledge-conception exist outside of the encyclopedic frame,
        but asserts that other contemporaneous conceptions of knowledge tend to
        define themselves in relation to the encyclopedic ideal.<a href="#fn37"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref37"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>37</sup></a> This explains why, for Kenny,
        the miscellany is often described as an explicit challenge to the
        encyclopedic model. In contrast to encyclopedias, miscellanies lack
        systematic or logical construction, and they frequently construe
        knowledge of nature in terms of flux rather than tractable propositions
        that can be fixed and organized.<a href="#fn38"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref38"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>38</sup></a> Instead of striving for
        universalizable knowledge, miscellanies (as their name suggests)
        typically consist of assemblies of particulars. While some miscellanies
        explicitly challenge—and even seek to reform—the approach to knowledge
        lauded by the encyclopedic ideal, others simply offer alternatives to
        that way of seeing the world.</p>
    <p>With the contrast between encyclopedic and miscellaneous works in hand,
        we can now consider Leong, Rankin, and Eamon’s claims in their context.
        It seems to me that these authors have alighted upon a way that certain
        books of secrets challenge the binary opposition of miscellaneous and
        encyclopedic conceptions of knowledge. By showing how some works aspire
        to systematicity without eschewing particularity or idiosyncrasy, Eamon,
        Rankin, and Leong identify the potential for seeing these books as
        robust records of kinds of knowledge uncapturable by the usual
        distinctions. If this is the case for typical books of secrets
        containing craft knowledge, Ms. Fr. 640 presents even more of a
        challenge to the encyclopedic-miscellaneous paradigm.</p>
    <p>At first, the manuscript seems clearly to fall outside of the
        encyclopedic ideal: no systematicity has been detected therein, and it
        contains recipes ranging from life casting to imitation gemstones to
        burn salves. It is difficult to imagine the recipes standing in
        necessary, complete, or systematic relation to one another. Still, Ms.
        Fr. 640 displays some surprisingly encyclopedic, or at least
        non-miscellaneous, elements. Recall that Pamela H. Smith has argued for
        understanding the manuscript as possessing a “philosophical” dimension,
        one which has systematic components in what she calls the
        author-practitioner’s “material imaginary.”<a href="#fn39"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref39"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>39</sup></a> Moreover, there are blank spaces
        on a few pages in Ms. Fr. 640 that might be interpreted as signs of
        systematic pre-planning, and the manuscript does not obviously explore
        skeptical worries or demand reforms to the encyclopedic approach to
        knowledge. These features of Ms. Fr. 640 seem to set it apart from
        Kenny’s characterization of miscellaneous texts.</p>
    <p>One final point about Ms. Fr. 640 would appear to land it in the
        encyclopedic camp, at least if Kenny is right about the relationship
        between <em>Kunstkammern</em> and the encyclopedic ideal. Kenny writes
        that a <em>Kunstkammer</em> “reveals encyclopaedic knowledge via
        physically small artefacts,” thus suggesting that <em>Kunstkammern</em>
        are representatives of the ideal of encyclopedic knowledge.<a
           href="#fn40"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref40"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>40</sup></a> Since many of the recipes found
        in Ms. Fr. 640 seem to produce objects that would have been destined
        for—or at least at home in—<em>Kunstkammern</em>, it is tempting to
        think of the manuscript as closely aligned with encyclopedic
        knowledge-conceptions because of the relationship Kenny posits. In
        addition, since books of secrets were collectors’ items in their own
        right rather than straightforward workshop manuals, Ms. Fr. 640’s
        kinship with that genre might underscore an encyclopedic tendency in the
        work.</p>
    <p>Nevertheless, this possible evidence of systematicity does not make Ms.
        Fr. 640 an encyclopedic text; on the contrary, the relationship between
        miscellaneous and encyclopedic elements in the manuscript is informative
        precisely because of the manuscript’s irreducibility to one category or
        the other. Perhaps Ms. Fr. 640 <em>does</em> evince a set of logical
        relations that we, twenty-first-century readers saddled with the legacy
        of a revisionist philosophical canon, do not have the epistemological
        framework to perceive—a miscellaneous presentation of a possibly
        systematic worldview. I think that the best way to conceive of Ms. Fr.
        640 calls for a rejection of the choice between the encyclopedic and
        miscellaneous paradigms, and that the complications generated in this
        rejection help point us in the direction of solutions to our questions
        about artisanal epistemology. Like philosophical fictions, perhaps works
        that are also records of active personal engagement—works that highlight
        the value of <em>doing</em> as a means of developing knowledge—fall
        somewhere outside of the terrain Kenny describes. It may be the case
        that engaging with these texts concretely is necessary to draw out the
        “material imaginary” they instantiate, as Smith’s scholarship already
        suggests. Such works may demand a new space all their own, one that
        pushes twenty-first-century readers to add new dimensions to our
        conceptions of knowledge, practice, and their interrelations.</p>
    <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>While the encyclopedic/miscellaneous binary does not perfectly map onto
        the relationship between propositional and practical knowledge, we might
        think that only practical knowledge has the potential to survive the
        skeptical challenge of reform-oriented miscellanies. Indeed, ancient
        Greek skeptics often faced the objection that their dictum of suspension
        of judgment would lead to inaction; after all, since know-how is thought
        to be non-propositional, practical knowledge seems not to present us

        enough aspects of Ms. Fr. 640 resemble the encyclopedic ideal to
        complicate the story about artisanal epistemology as exclusively
        practical knowledge, at least if practical knowledge is thought to
        consist in knowledge-how. What kind of knowledge does artisanal
        epistemology produce, then? Pamela H. Smith’s notion of “emergent
        knowledge” picks out a promising possibility:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>practical knowledge is very different from propositional knowledge,
            which is easy to capture in a written proof. Practical knowledge
            always involves emergent phenomena, and its ‘proof’ is brought into
            being in real time. A recipe, or better still, a compilation of
            recipes, thus indicates… the particularity, variability, and the
            emergent quality of material things, and of practical knowledge…
            Only by engaging in the practice of reconstruction—itself a form of
            emergent knowledge—would I have recognized this dimension of recipe
            compilations.<a href="#fn42"

               role="doc-noteref"><sup>42</sup></a></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>Smith’s account brings forth the sense in
        which concrete engagement with texts like Ms. Fr. 640 allows readers to
        access previously invisible and unsayable knowledge. Only through this
        sort of investigation can we hope to tackle the problem Pennell
        identifies when she writes that</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>both the recipe and the experimental observation… surely render
            complete demystification impossible. As a record of practice they
            are vulnerable precisely because, as texts of action, they always
            evade standardization.<a href="#fn43"

    </blockquote>
    <p>Nevertheless, I think the notion of emergent knowledge requires
        development. It seems to me that the emergent quality of this sort of
        practical knowledge describes the process of acquisition very well, but
        leaves open the question of what is being grasped through the process of
        emergence. The project of precisifying craft knowledge—of determining
        the thing that is apprehended, if it is a thing at all—leaves me groping
        about for something other, something uncaptured by traditional
        epistemological categories.</p>
    <p>Smith returns to this project in a forthcoming monograph, in which she
        explains her aim of defining “more clearly the terms… ‘skill’ and
        ‘<em>Kunst</em>.’”<a href="#fn44"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref44"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>44</sup></a> This undertaking is important
        because “there is not a language in which to analyze or historicize

           id="fnref45"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>45</sup></a> Smith offers a number of useful
        taxonomic possibilities, some of which—like “materialized theory”—reveal
        the intertwined natures of practical and propositional knowledge in
        artisanal epistemology.<a href="#fn46"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref46"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>46</sup></a> At the end of her chapter on the
        subject, Smith concludes that</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>artisanal epistemology, the search for certain knowledge that is
            carried out through action and practice must be extracted from the
            materials of nature by the practitioner through bodily struggle… at
            its most basic and all-encompassing, [artisanal epistemology] was
            simply and straightforwardly a mode of work.<a href="#fn47"

    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>Smith’s characterization of artisanal
        epistemology as a “mode of work” is illuminating because, among other
        things, it neatly challenges what she identifies as the “facile
        dichotomy” between propositional and practical knowledge by undermining
        the hierarchical relationship between mind and hand.<a href="#fn48"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref48"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>48</sup></a> Like the category of emergent
        knowledge, though, it seems to stop short of expressing <em>what it
            is</em> that artisanal work and emergent processes transfigure
        epistemically. After all, Smith’s lexical suggestions are meant to be
        taken up, experimented with, and enriched by further scholarship. I
        think that the difficulty of getting at the content of knowledge yielded
        by artisanal epistemological practices traces to a deeper point than the
        need for more research, however: perhaps, instead, it is an issue of
        articulation, a challenge which arises precisely because of the
        disciplinary domination of the categories of knowledge-that and
        knowledge-how. Michael Polanyi suggests in <em>Personal Knowledge</em>
        that</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>the actual foundations of our scientific beliefs cannot be asserted
            at all… They are not asserted and cannot be asserted, for assertions
            can be made only within a framework with which we have identified
            ourselves for the time being.<a href="#fn49"

    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>Polanyi’s proposal emerges from the
        particular context of attempting to account for the authority of
        scientific beliefs in light of their apparently absurd foundations. Even
        so, I think his insight points to a program of inquiry that counts
        concrete investigation among its irreplaceable components. If Polanyi is
        right, it could be that “the thing that is grasped” through emergent
        processes will remain inarticulable until such time as we are able to
        identify ourselves within a different framework, one which responds to
        and learns from the material imaginaries of early modern vernacular
        philosophers. Maybe concrete engagement with Ms. Fr. 640’s setting of
        action has the potential to make previously inarticulable possibilities
        available by activating the very “bodily struggle” Smith describes
        above. Polanyi anticipates this line of thought when he suggests that
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>like the tool, the sign or the symbol can be conceived as such only
            in the eyes of a person who <em>relies on them</em> to achieve or
            signify something. <em>This reliance is a personal commitment which
                is involved in all acts of intelligence</em>… Every act of
            personal assimilation by which we make a thing forms an extension of
            ourselves through our subsidiary awareness of it, is a commitment of
            ourselves; a manner of disposing of ourselves.</p>
        <p>But the context of purpose and commitment… yet lacks dynamic
            character. The pouring out of ourselves into the particulars given
            by experience so as to make sense of them… is not achieved
            effortlessly.<a href="#fn50"

                <p>Wilson notes that beginning in the late 1960s, the word
                    “text” “came to refer to a literary work, in place of the
                    word ‘work’ itself, and it began to subsume the
                    written-or-printed word as such, in all its manifold forms.”
                    Wilson, “What is a text?,” 341. However, the term applies
                    today in a wide variety of non-lexical contexts; e.g.,
                    paintings and pieces of music can also be analyzed as texts.
                    I will use the word mostly in Wilson’s terms as “literary
