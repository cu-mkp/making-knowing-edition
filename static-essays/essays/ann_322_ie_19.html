        <div>
            <p>This essay summarizes some recent historiography that has
                featured historical reconstructions, and discusses the Making
                and Knowing Project’s particular methodologies for
                reconstructing the practices, techniques, and technologies
                documented in Ms. Fr. 640. Reconstruction has been successfully
                employed by historians of science, art historians, conservators,
                experimental archaeologists, and a variety of other groups who
                each used a particular methodology for addressing questions
                about history. In the graduate seminars of the Making and
                Knowing Laboratory, students were guided through several
                skill-building activities before devising a research project of
                their own. Research in the laboratory emphasized a careful
                understanding of historical materials, a focus on the process
                rather than the outcome of reconstructions, and a synergistic
                relationship between textual research and laboratory work. I
                argue that our experimental method can best be understood as
                exploratory experimentation. Likewise, while the methods
                developed were specific to reconstruction of entries in Ms. Fr.
                640, there are many other applications across a broad spectrum
                of historical research and pedagogy.</p>

    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
    <p>In recent decades a diverse group of historians has turned their
        attention to the reconstruction or reworking of historical experiments,
        recipes, techniques, and technologies as a means of doing historical
        research. These research methods are not entirely novel, and have in
        part been borrowed and extrapolated from scientists, archaeologists, as
        well as conservation and museum scholars. Within archaeology, the field
        of “experimental archaeology” is focused on the reconstruction of
        ancient structures and artifacts to replicate or approximate their use
        in earlier cultures and generate and test hypotheses about their
        feasibility.<a href="#fn1"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref1"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> Likewise, art conservators and
        art historians have long reconstructed earlier techniques and materials
        to understand processes of making art, and also how to preserve and
        restore objects.<a href="#fn2"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref2"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> Far from replacing more
        traditional textual research, these material methods are generally
        thought to be supplementary, but they still have occasionally been
        controversial among historians. Still, following the so-called “material
        turn” and the more recent success of a number of research programs in
        technical art history and the history of science, there is less
        controversy about the legitimacy of using such reworkings and
        reproductions in historiography.<a href="#fn3"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref3"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> Even so, using reconstructions as
        a means of doing historical research is still relatively new territory,
        and practitioners thus must tailor research methods to particular fields
        and questions. This was certainly the case on the Making and Knowing
        Project. This essay summarizes some recent historiography that has
        featured reconstructions and then discusses the Making and Knowing
        Project’s methodologies for carrying out research on the recipes of BnF
        Ms. Fr. 640.</p>

        Historical Reconstructions in the History of Science and Art History
    </h2>
    <p>The use of reconstruction is not unprecedented in modern historical
        research, and, in addition to informing the work of museum scholars,
        archaeologists, art historians, and art conservators, similar techniques
        have been used by historians of science since at least the mid-twentieth
        century.<a href="#fn4"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref4"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> Some scholars have used the terms
        “reworking,” “remaking,” or “re-enacting” to describe similar
        approaches, and Sven Dupré has helpfully grouped these under what he
        calls “performative methods.”<a href="#fn5"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref5"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> Disentangling the particular
        connotations of each of these terms is beyond the scope of this essay
        and I thus use “reconstruction” as that term has been commonly used in
        the contexts that are the subject matter here—the history of science and
        art history.</p>
    <p>Early work utilizing reconstructions was situated primarily within the
        history of physics and focused on reconstructions of Galileo Galilei’s
        mechanics and Isaac Newton’s optical experiments.<a href="#fn6"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref6"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> In recent years, significant
        research programs in the history of science that have employed
        reconstructions are Otto Sibum’s Experimental History of Science,
        Lawrence M. Principe’s and William R. Newman’s New Historiography of
        Alchemy, and Hasok Chang’s reconstructions of historical experiments for
        novel uses in science education and to “complement” contemporary
        science.</p>
    <p>Sibum reconstructed James Prescott Joule’s paddle wheel experiments on
        the mechanical value of heat and concluded that Joule’s visual
        representations and descriptions in laboratory notebooks were
        insufficient to accurately carry out the experiment.<a href="#fn7"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref7"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> Far from simply providing
        information about the internal workings of a famous experiment in the
        history of science, Sibum argued on the basis of his reconstruction that
        Joule could not have worked alone (as Joule had claimed), and that his
        tacit knowledge and manual expertise in measuring precise temperatures
        came from working in his father’s brewery. Sibum recently explained the
        importance of using this methodology, writing, “Only through the
        historiographical approach, called experimental history of science,
        could I get access to hitherto unrecognized dimensions of past
        practice.”<a href="#fn8"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref8"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
    <p>Principe and Newman’s diverse lines of research using experimental
        reconstructions have been a foundational component in reshaping the
        field of the history of alchemy, namely by demonstrating that many of
        the seemingly implausible, bizarre, or esoteric descriptions in
        alchemical texts—often hidden by <em>Decknamen</em> or code names—were
        actually about physical phenomena that could be reproduced in a
        laboratory. Principe has reworked alchemical experiments from diverse
        alchemists including Robert Boyle (1627–1691), George Starkey
        (1628–1665), and the pseudonymous Basil Valentine (fl. 1600), while
        Newman has focused on reconstructions of experiments by Isaac Newton as
        a part of <em>The Chymistry of Isaac Newton</em>.<a href="#fn9"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref9"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> This work has not only shown that
        early modern alchemy involved a high degree of technical difficulty and
        a sophisticated understanding of chemical transformations on the part of
        some of the most luminous intellectuals of the early modern era, but
        that it was also not unrelated to other areas of the scientific
        enterprise such as optics or mechanics. This research has entirely
        deflated the view commonly held in the twentieth century that alchemy
        was predominantly a psychological phenomenon based largely on a textual
        and esoteric tradition instead of material practice in a laboratory.<a

    <p>These several projects have uncovered important historical details that
        were concealed in written accounts. Joule’s texts had the effect of
        obfuscating the nature of his collaborative scientific practice, likely
        to preserve his image as a lone genius, while many alchemical texts used
        obscure language to conceal secrets from the uninitiated, while at the
        same time revealing information to other adepti who understood the
        alchemical code, as it were. Reconstruction research has also uncovered
        details about practices that were likely considered too commonplace to
        mention or that were too difficult to put into words on a page. It has
        thus helped to dispel notions that certain scientific theories arose
        from a generally theoretical milieu, disconnected from the messiness of
        practice, and has likewise shown the importance of artisanal and craft
        traditions in the rise of early-modern science.<a href="#fn11"

    <p>Hasok Chang has suggested novel ways that reconstructions of historical
        experiments can be deployed not only to change science education, but as
        an important complement to contemporary scientific research.<a
           href="#fn12"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref12"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> Stimulated by the work of
        diverse chemists from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries who
        studied temperature and the phenomenon of boiling, he carried out a
        series of experiments that show the variability of the boiling point of
        water, challenging the “myth” commonly told to students, “that pure
        water always boils at 100°C (212°F), under normal atmospheric
        pressure.”<a href="#fn13"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref13"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> Chang suggests that the
        reconstruction of historical experiments is not only important for
        science education and for dispelling other such myths about the nature
        of knowledge, but asks complementary questions that are generally
        excluded from current science. He argues that this complementarity
        provides an important role for the history and philosophy of science,
        which, informed by reconstructions, “can recover useful ideas and facts
        lost in the record of past science; address foundational questions
        concerning present science; and explore alternative conceptual systems
        and lines of experimental inquiry for future science.”<a href="#fn14"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref14"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
    <p>While the use of reconstructions in historical research has gained a
        certain prominence in recent years, this should not give the impression
        that scholars who engage in such reconstructions have promised results
        beyond what they can deliver, or that they have suggested their work
        ought to displace other more traditional methods. Indeed, these
        historians have generally been transparent and circumspect about what
        reconstruction can do. As Sibum has concluded, the reconstruction of
        historical experiments is “a complementary technique within the
        conventional tool kit of the historian.”<a href="#fn15"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref15"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> These historians have been
        equally forthcoming about the difficulties and pitfalls inherent in this
        research and the need for training that enables scholars to ask fruitful
        historical questions and that allows them to conduct meaningful work in
        the laboratory.</p>
    <p>Comparing these several research programs in the history of science
        illustrates well that there is no single method for carrying out a
        reconstruction. Just as the different disciplines that constitute
        science today employ diverse methods for exploring the natural world, so
        too different reconstructions and questions about history require
        different tools and techniques. Within the history of science, some
        reconstructions have required careful attention to the replication of an
        experimental process that simulates as closely as possible the
        apparatus, performative gestures, and environmental conditions of the
        original, whereas other reconstructions take the approach of limiting
        variables or abstracting particular phenomena from a process in order to
        test a hypothesis.</p>
    <p>Art historians and conservators have likewise fruitfully employed the
        methodologies of reconstruction to investigate a large variety of
        historical materials and techniques, and such reconstructions have been
        an important part of the rise of the new subspecialty Technical Art
        History.<a href="#fn16"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref16"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> One especially thoughtful and
        influential reconstruction methodology that has been tailored to the
        particular questions and needs of a group of technical art historians
        and conservators is the HART (Historically Accurate Reconstruction
        Techniques) methodology.<a href="#fn17"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref17"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> This approach can be applied to
        a range of cultural artifacts and begins with analysis of an object and
        the textual study of contemporary documents that discuss the object at
        hand (e.g., early modern recipes for making pigments). It then calls for
        chemical analysis of extant works of art to identify materials used, and
        then proceeds to reconstruct the materials and processes using—as much
        as possible—substances and tools that would have been available to
        historical actors. Since the HART method was formulated, authors have
        continued to adapt and fine-tune its methods.<a href="#fn18"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref18"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> Likewise, beyond the Making and
        Knowing Project, methods from Technical Art History have been integral
        to other large-scale projects such as the ERC-funded ARTECHNE Project,
        which explores the transmission of techniques in the visual and
        decorative arts.<a href="#fn19"

           role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
    <p>In all reconstruction research, while there are broad similarities that
        cut across disciplinary boundaries, the particular methodology that one
        chooses will be determined largely by the nature of the questions that
        one is asking about history. Beyond the aforementioned areas of the
        history of science and art history, reconstruction and performative
        methods have been deployed to address a gamut of historical questions on
        notable subjects including the history of fashion, early music, and
        culinary recipes.<a href="#fn20"

           role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
    <h2 id="making-and-knowing-methodology">Making and Knowing Methodology</h2>
    <p>The Making and Knowing Project at Columbia University drew on the
        aforementioned projects and scholars to develop a methodology for
        reconstructing the recipes in Ms. Fr. 640.<a href="#fn21"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref21"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a> The research on the project was
        carried out almost entirely by graduate students participating in the
        <em>Craft and Science</em> seminars held in the Making and Knowing
        Laboratory, but involved close collaboration with professors,
        postdoctoral researchers, paleographers, museum professionals,
        conservators, and expert makers. It is important to note also that this
        project was aimed at pedagogical as well as research ends, and entirely
        disentangling these two goals would be practically impossible. This also
        had an impact on our methodology insofar as the semester-long course
        only allowed for limited time to repeat and refine experiments, often
        resulting in a basic “proof of concept” rather than robust experimental
        data.</p>
    <p>In brief, the reconstruction component of <em>Craft and Science</em>
        seminars began with various skill-building activities related to the
        theme of a particular year (i.e, Metalworking and Moldmaking,
        Colormaking, Practical Knowledge, Ephemeral Art, and Printmaking) that
        challenged students to begin thinking about how one formulates a
        research question that can be addressed by a reconstruction, and then
        how one ought to proceed in the laboratory to answer that question. Each
        seminar developed a “Template for Reconstruction” that addressed such
        issues as: the importance of historical context and reading widely to
        determine a recipe’s “genealogy;” whether a given recipe is complete or
        has omitted information necessary for reconstruction; how individual
        words in the recipe might have meanings different from modern language;
        how to address issues of scale, units of measurement, and the common
        problem that measures are sometimes omitted from early-modern recipes;
        and perhaps most important, how to determine what materials and
        equipment were used and how these could be replicated with as much
        historical care and sensitivity (and as little anachronism) as possible
        in a reconstruction.</p>
    <p>After skill-building and training in how to keep field notes documenting
        their work in the laboratory, students proposed a research project that
        required some manner of reconstruction of one or several recipes in Ms.
        Fr. 640. Students generally found that this was one of the most
        difficult aspects of the course, and formulating a historical question
        that could be addressed with laboratory research and that was feasible
        within the space of half a semester was no simple task. Likewise, many
        students found that their research questions evolved as they became more
        familiar with historical materials, as their work in the laboratory
        informed their reading of the manuscript, or as their techniques and
        abilities improved.</p>
    <p>Each student’s research was unique, and the projects spanned an enormous
        thematic breadth, partially as a result of the sheer diversity of the
        recipes in Ms. Fr. 640, but over the course of the project several
        motifs emerged that were helpful in formulating research questions and
        carrying out historically interesting reconstructions.</p>
    <p>First, we found it important to emphasize—and continually remind
        ourselves and the students—that focusing on the <em>process</em> rather
        than the <em>outcome</em> of a reconstruction would yield more insights
        about history. It was very easy—at least, speaking personally—in the
        course of reconstructing a recipe, especially one that promised an
        aesthetically beautiful final <em>product</em>, to lose sight of the
        true end goal which was to understand the <em>process</em>. This
        methodological tenet is instantiated in most of the objects produced in
        our laboratory which are purposefully unfinished and show, for instance,
        the gates and sprues used to cast a flower from life (<i><u>Fig.
                1</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 2</u></i>).</p>

    <p>Second, our work on this project benefited from the nature of our
        collaborative practice. Students gained insights into materials and
        techniques from colleagues, expert makers, the student paleographers who
        transcribed and translated the manuscript in the summer Text Workshops,
        and other contributing scholars (including participants of the annual
        Working Group Meetings) whose advice and experience was integral to the
        success of research projects (<i><u>Fig. 3</u></i>, <i><u>Fig.
                4</u></i>). This type of collaborative practice is normal for
        the sciences but is largely absent from historical research, which tends
        to solitary textual research, and while this is not to say that one
        could not perform reconstructions alone, much is to be gained from
        collective work.</p>

    <p>Another theme that was continually reinforced over the course of the
        project was the synergistic relationship between textual research and
        work in the laboratory. Naturally, taking the approach of reading very
        widely in both primary and secondary sources led to the most interesting
        research questions, but what was perhaps more surprising was the manner
        in which reconstructions led to different readings of a recipe or even
        just one word in a recipe. Simply by being forced to take the time to
        think about each material and each step of a process forces one to read
        passages more carefully, and often the experience of reconstruction
        provided special insights into an author’s particular usage of a word.
        Students in one of the Moldmaking and Metalworking seminars found this
        to be the case with the author-practitioner’s use of
        “<em>s’attaque</em>” in several recipes, where a modern translation
        might give the idea of a substance <em>attacking</em> other materials or
        tools, but their experience in a reconstruction with sticky, unyielding
        substances led them to question this interpretation and reread early
        modern dictionaries, which suggested the possibility that the
        connotation of the word was instead something more like
        <em>attach</em>.<a href="#fn22"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref22"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a> Such re-readings were
        commonplace in the laboratory.</p>
    <p>Similarly, because many of the materials and techniques described in Ms.
        Fr. 640 are unfamiliar today, we found that even our most basic material
        explorations yielded interesting and novel information. For instance,
        Stephanie Pope and Caroline Marris carried out a reconstruction of
        “powder for hourglasses” which called for the peculiar technique of
        mixing molten lead with common salt, and they ultimately found that this
        process yielded small, heavy beads of a shape and size ideal for an
        hourglass.<a href="#fn23"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref23"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a> This experiment demonstrated
        that the author-practitioner’s recipe was feasible, but it also opened
        an important piece of early modern material culture to sensory and
        empirical understanding. The experimenters were able to explore how the
        hourglass sand behaved and the sensory qualities it produced: what it
        felt like, how it rolled and flowed, and its general heft. The
        experience of making this material also opened up numerous questions
        about domestic production, timekeeping practices for artisans and
        households, and the cultural significance of hourglasses in early modern
        Europe.</p>
    <p>The methods in this experiment are representative of much of the research
        on the Making and Knowing Project, and, when considering what its mode
        of knowledge production is, can perhaps be best understood as a form of
        exploratory experimentation. Modern philosophers of science have
        suggested that this type of experimentation is not strictly driven by
        the testing of hypotheses, and instead seeks out empirical regularities
        when dealing with questions where there are no or few well-developed
        theories.<a href="#fn24"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref24"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a> Such experiments investigate
        phenomena without first limiting the outcomes of the experiment in
        accordance with extant theories. Descriptions of this manner of
        investigation, however, are certainly not limited to modern
        philosophers; Robert Boyle, for instance, described a method for
        “indagatory” or “exploratory” experiments that is strikingly similar.
        Boyle noted that experimenters sometimes encountered unfamiliar
        materials and the best course of action to understand the said materials
        was to perform various experiments “to discover what quality or other
        attribute may be found in the subject, of which we have but a suspicion
        not knowledge.”<a href="#fn25"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref25"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a> Boyle also described some of his
        exploratory experiments with his air pump as being carried out in a
        “haphazard manner [...] in order to determine more accurately the
        effects it was capable of producing.”<a href="#fn26"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref26"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a> Making sense of the unfamiliar
        materials and techniques in Ms. Fr. 640 required such forms of material
        exploration, and among the diverse conceptual outputs of our students, a
        common refrain was that an experiment had demonstrated proof of
        concept—that the author-practitioner’s description of a given technology
        or process was feasible.<a href="#fn27"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref27"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
    <p>Our methodology in the laboratory was limited by concerns about safety,
        the availability of materials and apparatus, and the rather short amount
        of time that students could devote to a research project in the space of
        a semester. Likewise, because most students had limited experience
        working in a laboratory setting, the range of potential projects was
        somewhat restricted. And, unlike other projects in Technical Art History
        or Experimental History of Science, we lacked much of the modern
        analytical apparatus that could have been used to produce empirical data
        regarding the processes and products we produced in the laboratory.</p>
    <p>Even so, the Making and Knowing Project provides an important case study
        demonstrating that those without extensive laboratory training can
        produce historical knowledge, or at least raise questions about material
        culture that could not have been produced through strictly textual
        scholarship. The methodology that evolved in our laboratory was specific
        to the reconstruction of the recipes in Ms. Fr. 640, but many of the
        general guidelines we developed and the lessons we learned are
        applicable across a broad spectrum of experimental historical research
        and should prove useful to other scholars looking to add tools to their
        methodological and pedagogical tool kits.</p>
