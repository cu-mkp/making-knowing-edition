        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <div>
            <p>Among recipes in BnF Ms. Fr. 640 devoted to gilding, two give
                instructions for laying gold leaf on paper and parchment, and
                these recipes distinguish themselves by their reliance on an
                unusual mordant made from wheat starch (fols. <a
                   href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/10v/f/10v/tl"><u>10v</u></a>
                and <a
                   href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/29v/f/29v/tl"><u>29v</u></a>).
                By reconstructing these recipes, this essay evaluates the
                possible ways in which this adhesive could have been used in the
                context of gilding on paper and parchment.</p>

        differ from other such recipes in their use of mordants derived from
        wheat starch. While use of this substance as an adhesive for paper or

        conservators today—it is unusual to see it employed as a mordant in
        gilding. Reconstruction of these recipes paired with historical research
        on their context can suggest the ways in which the author-practitioner
        came to employ this adhesive in gilding.</p>

    <p>In the wheat starch recipe for the laying of gold leaf on paper or
        parchment (fol. 10v), the author-practitioner states that the
        <em>colle</em> (glue) must be <em>fort clere</em> (very clear), implying
        that it must have a more liquid and translucent consistency than the
        paste I had made. To ensure that my paste was clear but still thick
        enough to be considered <em>colle</em> while still being <em>fort
            clere</em>, I placed three palette-knife sized scoops of the paste
        into a beaker and heated it in a bain-marie until it became liquid. With
        the addition of 100 ml of water it became translucent (<i><u>Fig. 2</u></i>).</p>

    <p>For the process of laying the gold leaf on paper (fol. 29v), the
        author-practitioner describes the adhesive not as glue (<em>colle</em>),
        but as <em>eau d’amydon</em> (starch water). This recipe specifies
        soaking wheat starch in water (<em>amydon destrempe en eau</em>) and
        then explains that clear starch water (<em>l’eau clere d’amydon</em>) is
        a good base for burnished gold. I thus assumed that <em>eau clere
            d’amydon</em> probably referred to a more liquid and transparent
        substance than the <em>colle d’amydon</em> of fol. 10v and that this
        “clear starch water” was likely made mainly of water with only a small
        amount of starch soaked in it. To make clear starch water, I added one
        scoop of the cold starch glue from my reconstruction of the Cennini
        recipe to 200 ml of distilled water—a mixture with more water and less
        starch than I used for the starch glue. I heated the mixture in a
        bain-marie with a beaker until it was a cloudy liquid. This mixture
        behaved more like a watery, runny liquid than the gluey <em>colle
            d’amydon</em> (hereafter “starch glue”) (<i><u>Fig. 3</u></i>).</p>

    <h3 id="gilding">Gilding</h3>
    <p>Gilding is a difficult and delicate task. Individual leaves of gold are
        so light that they can be disturbed by any movement of air, even breath.
        I practiced gilding before attempting to gild using the two
        <em>amydon</em> mordants; however, I was unable to lay the gold leaf
        down perfectly in either instance.<a href="#fn10"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref10"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> While I am not experienced
        enough to produce a flawless result in which the leaf lays down flat and
        does not roll over onto itself, my trials showed that the gold leaf did
        adhere to the mordants.</p>
    <h3 id="materials-and-tools">Materials and Tools</h3>
    <p>The gold leaf and gilding tools I employed in reconstructing the
        author-practitioner’s recipes are very different from those used in the
        sixteenth century. Sixteenth-century gilders acquired gold leaf from a
        goldbeater, who made gold leaf by beating coins into the thinnest
        possible sheets.<a href="#fn11"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref11"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> Unlike other metals, gold can be
        reduced to a thickness of several atoms without crumbling, allowing for
        the creation of extremely thin leaves.<a href="#fn12"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref12"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> Sixteenth-century gold coins
        like ducats were alloyed with other metals, making them less flexible
        and heavier than pure gold leaf.<a href="#fn13"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref13"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> Using weights outlined in
        Cennino Cennini’s <em>Il libro dell’arte</em>, Daniel V. Thompson
        calculated that a single sheet of sixteenth-century gold leaf weighed
        approximately 0.54 grams, whereas modern gold leaf weighs approximately
        0.20 grams. Sixteenth-century gold leaf was thus likely twice as heavy
        and less pliable than the 23 karat gold leaf used in modern gilding.
        Because of the difficulty in sourcing a contemporary gold leaf of
        thicker proportions and unknown alloy, I used a 0.2 gram gold leaf and
        worked with a gilder’s set. I cut the leaf on a gilding cushion with a
        knife and used a gilder’s tip to pick up and apply the leaf. The
        gilder’s tip is likely a post-medieval invention; medieval gold leaf did
        not require such a delicate tool because it was heavier and less
        pliable.<a href="#fn14"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref14"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> It is more likely that premodern
        gilders would have used a small shovel made out of parchment or paper to
        move the gold leaf.<a href="#fn15"

    <p>The recipe on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/10v/f/10v/tl"><u>10v</u></a>
        specifies that starch glue can be used to apply gold leaf to paper or
        parchment, while the recipe on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/29v/f/29v/tl"><u>29v</u></a>
        is explicitly intended for paper. The surface texture of both substrates
        is very different and affects the surface appearance of the applied
        gold. Sixteenth-century paper possessed an uneven and fibrous texture.
        The papers I used are gelatin-sized sheets made of hemp and cotton fiber
        made by the University of Iowa’s Center for the Book.<a href="#fn16"
           class="footnote-ref"

    <p>Parchment is generally much thicker and denser than paper and thus
        behaves very differently. It was made from the hides of calves, sheep,
        or goats. While the exact process of medieval parchment production is
        unknown, the procedure involved washing and removing hair from the hide
        and then stretching and drying it on a frame.<a href="#fn17"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref17"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> I used vellum (parchment made
        from calf) sourced from Henk de Groot, a maker of parchment based in
        Rotterdam who uses sixteenth-century techniques. Modern parchment makers
        remove hair chemically using sodium sulphide, whereas sixteenth-century
        parchment makers would have done so manually. Regardless of technique,
        the resulting hairless parchment is the same.<a href="#fn18"

    <p>Unlike paper, which is uniform on both sides, parchment differs markedly
        on the flesh side (the side on the interior of the animal’s body) and
        the hair side (on the exterior of the animal’s body). The flesh side
        tends to be whiter and softer while the hair side tends to be yellower
        and smoother, with the hair follicles visible as bumps.<a href="#fn19"

        however, does not specify which side of the parchment to gild.</p>
    <h3 id="applying-the-mordants-and-laying-down-the-gold-leaf">Applying the
        Mordants and Laying Down the Gold Leaf</h3>
    <p>I taped two pieces of parchment (one hair side and one flesh side) and a
        piece of paper to a sheet of cardboard in order to compare all three
        substrates (<i><u>Fig. 4</u></i>). I then took a flat paint brush and,
        following the instructions on fol. 10v, applied five layers of the wheat
        starch glue (<em>colle d’amydon</em>) to each substrate and then gilded
        them (<i><u>Fig. 5</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 6</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 7</u></i>).
        I used a piece of cheesecloth attached to a paintbrush to tamp the gold
        leaf flat (<i><u>Fig. 8</u></i>).<a href="#fn20"

    <p>I waited for the four trials to dry before burnishing them with an agate
        burnisher. I removed the gilded papers and parchments from their
        cardboard backings and placed them onto a hard plastic table where I
        could apply maximum pressure while burnishing. I burnished only the
        right half of all three types of substrates, leaving the left side
        unburnished. The recipe on fol. 10v does not specify burnishing the gold
        leaf on wheat starch glue, but it is possible that the
        author-practitioner presumed it to be an obvious part of the technique (<i><u>Fig. 12</u></i>). He notes on fol. 29v that gold leaf applied to
        paper with starch water will burnish well. Indeed, after burnishing, the
        paper became much smoother and more reflective (<i><u>Fig. 13</u></i>).

    <p>The gold leaf laid on wheat starch glue (following the recipe on fol.
        10v) adhered well to both sides of the parchment and to the paper.
        Additionally, the glue was thin enough that the grainy texture of the
        hair side was visible through the gilding. However, because the modern
        gold leaf was thinner than that of the sixteenth century, it is
        plausible that the grain would not have shown through to the same degree
        for the author-practitioner. Both pieces of parchment became slightly
        warped after a week. This is common because parchment tends to revert to
        the living curves of its source animal (<i><u>Fig. 14</u></i>). Despite
        the warping, the gold remained securely attached to the parchment. It is
        likely, however, that the moisture from the glue caused the parchment to
        warp as it dried, which would be problematic if it were for use within a
        bound manuscript. The paper absorbed much of the starch glue (<em>colle
            d’amydon</em>), making the paper rather fragile during the
        application of the gold leaf, as wet paper is much more likely to rip
        than wet parchment. The starch water (of the recipe on fol. 29v) was
        much more liquid than the starch glue, resulting in an even more fragile
        paper substrate.</p>

    <p>Overall, the thinness of the starch water on paper allowed for a less
        textured surface than the starch glue on paper, creating a more easily
        burnished gold surface. However, the starch water was less adhesive than
        the starch glue, and would therefore likely have been unsuitable for
        gilding on parchment; this may be the reason that the recipe on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/29v/f/29v/tl"><u>29v</u></a>
        does not mention using starch water to gild on parchment. The adhesive
        strength of starch glue makes it effective on both paper and parchment,
        however it forms a thick underlayer which makes it less suitable for
        burnishing.</p>
    <p>The burnished and unburnished parchment did not appear significantly
        different. The hair side was so rough and hard that it was impossible to
        apply any more pressure. The grain was still visible through both the
        burnished and unburnished sections (<i><u>Fig. 15</u></i>). This was not
        the case in manuscripts illuminated on the hair side of parchment in the
        author-practitioner’s lifetime. They were gilded without the grain
        showing through the gold leaf. Parchment naturally changes shape when
        wet, similar to my experience when the glue was applied. The slightly
        raised gilded areas in medieval manuscripts was partly due to the
        reshaping of the parchment beneath the gold leaf as it became wet with
        mordant (<i><u>Fig. 16</u></i>).<a href="#fn23"

    <p>The gold leaf on paper burnished well with respect to both shine and
        texture, both on the starch glue and on the starch water. The gilding
        with starch water looked flatter than the paper gilding on starch glue,
        though not considerably. Both were similarly reflective. The grain of
        the paper was still slightly visible through the gold leaf for both, but
        this is fairly common with gilded paper. Overall, both the gold leaf
        applied with starch water and the gold leaf applied with starch glue
        were of similar quality to gilded works on paper produced during the
        Renaissance, such as a fifteenth-century illuminated paper manuscript
        copy of Dante’s <em>Purgatory</em> (<i><u>Fig. 19</u></i>).</p>

                Much like the gold leaf in this illumination, the burnished gold

    <p>None of my burnished papers or parchments were absolutely flat or
        reflective. This is apparent when these pieces are compared to gilded
        panels with an underlayer of bole, which produces a perfectly smooth,
        flat surface (<i><u>Fig. 20</u></i>). Nevertheless, the paper and
        parchment gilded with wheat starch (<em>amydon</em>) mordants come close
        to the flat surface and shine seen in medieval manuscripts. Naturally, I
        cannot conclude anything about the longevity of my trials in comparison
        to medieval gilded paper and parchment, much of which has endured for
        centuries.</p>

    <p>Ms. Fr. 640 was written at a time when texts were being produced in both
        manuscript and print. The production of manuscripts declined slowly with
        the rise of the printing press, and early printers left space for
        illuminated capitals and gilded images in their printed texts.<a

        made with a more uniform surface in a mold (unlike parchment which
        varied with the individual animal), and thus formed a better surface for
        printing. The author-practitioner’s concern for gilding on both paper
        and parchment reflects the coexistence of manuscripts and print
        materials at the end of the sixteenth century.</p>
    <p>Prior to the twelfth century, illuminators used a gold pigment that was
        composed of ground gold and a binder, and which had a grainy character
        and little luster.<a href="#fn29"

    <p>Illuminated manuscripts grew in popularity in Western Europe during the
        twelfth century as a result of heightened contact with Byzantium during
        the Crusades, contact that proved influential for Western art and
        architecture.<a href="#fn32"

    <p>Many incunables and early printed works continued to use gold leaf as a
        means of replicating the prestige of illuminated manuscripts. Early
        printed Bibles, including some produced by Gutenberg, were resplendent
        with illuminated capitals or painted block prints to resemble
        manuscripts.<a href="#fn35"

    <p>By the mid-seventeenth century, printers had devised ways of printing
        with gold leaf. They applied a “hard varnish” to the type, printed this
        on the paper, then placed gold leaf on top of the varnish. When the gold
        leaf was brushed away, it would only remain on the printed text.<a

        leaving only the gold lettering.</p>
    <h2 id="mordants-used-in-gilding">Mordants used in Gilding</h2>
    <p>The author-practitioner’s use of wheat starch as a mordant is unusual.
        Starch is not mentioned in premodern comprehensive texts on gilding.
        From the twelfth to the sixteenth century in Western Europe, the most
        common mordants used in gilding on paper and parchment were glair (made
        from whipped egg white), gums, sizing glues, and gessos.<a href="#fn39"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref39"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>39</sup></a> In an anonymous
        fourteenth-century treatise, the <em>Liber de coloribus</em>, the author
        lists gypsum, hide glue, egg white, “brazil,” ocher, Apulian white,
        cinnabar, urine, gums, and pine sap as ingredients which, in different
        combinations, could serve as mordants for gilding.<a href="#fn40"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref40"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>40</sup></a> He does not mention
        <em>amydon</em> or starch as a possible mordant.</p>
    <p>Starch paste is not discussed in writings on limning, as the painting of
        portrait miniatures was known in the late sixteenth century. The English
        limner Nicholas Hillard, in his <em>Art of Limning</em> (ca. 1600),
        instructs to use gum as a mordant for gold leaf.<a href="#fn41"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref41"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>41</sup></a> Thomas Purfoot, another
        contemporary limner, suggests using garlic, glair, gum arabic, fig milk,
        and snail mucus, but not starch.<a href="#fn42"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref42"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>42</sup></a> Thus, it is unlikely that the
        author-practitioner found this recipe in a contemporary source. Wheat
        starch mordants also do not appear in recipes from the Islamic
        tradition. Snail glue and fish glue were the two most common mordants
        for medieval Arabic manuscripts.<a href="#fn43"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref43"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>43</sup></a> Medieval Islamic illuminators
        did use starch glue, however, for making inks.<a href="#fn44"

           id="fnref44"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>44</sup></a></p>
    <p>The author-practitioner also employs more common mordants like glair and
        bole throughout the manuscript, though not in conjunction with gilding
        on paper or parchment. In addition, he describes other adhesives used in
        gilding: on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/8r/f/8r/tl"><u>8r</u></a>,
        as mentioned above, he describes using fig milk, and on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/32r/f/32r/tl"><u>32r</u></a>,
        he describes “layering gold in distemper” by means of “a
        <em>batture</em>, that is joiner’s glue tempered with water on the fire,
        moderately clear, mixed with very little honey.” This latter technique
        is used by “common painters &amp; scribes” and is “undone in the rain.”
        Wheat starch glue and water are the only mordants that the
        author-practitioner explicitly recommends for gilding on paper and
        parchment. Thus, his use of starch glue—despite access to other mordants
        popular with illuminators—seems a conscious decision, or perhaps an
        exploratory process.</p>
    <h2 id="other-uses-of-amydon-in-ms.-fr.-640">Other Uses of “<em>Amydon</em>”
        in Ms. Fr. 640</h2>
    <p>While starch glues do not seem to have been used for gilding, they were
        commonly used to adhere paper to paper or parchment to parchment.<a
           href="#fn45"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref45"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>45</sup></a> The French notary and compiler
        of craft recipes Jean le Begue notes in his 1431 text:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>But if you wish to join paper only and not parchment, wheat-flour or
            powdered bread-crumbs mixed with pure water and slightly boiled is
            good for paper. But if you mix a little gum-arabic or whipped white
            of egg with it, it will do for parchment.<a href="#fn46"
               class="footnote-ref"
               id="fnref46"
               role="doc-noteref"><sup>46</sup></a></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>This passage also shows that parchment
        requires a stronger adhesive than paper, which is consistent with the
        author-practitioner’s use of starch water on paper but not on parchment.
    </p>
    <p>The author-practitioner did not specify glueing paper to paper with
        starch derivatives; however, he uses them for several other purposes. On
        fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/20v/f/20v/tl"><u>20v</u></a>
        the author-practitioner mentions wheat starch mixed with water to whiten
        the face, suggesting it in place of grinding a puffball mushroom with
        water for this purpose. A substance made with water and wheat starch
        might be ideal in both texture and color for this face-whitener because
        it retains its tacky texture without over-drying and cracking, and it
        has an opaque white color that does not cake or appear matte. Recipes
        for oil painting on taffeta also make use of starch water, for example,
        on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/42v/f/42v/tl"><u>42v</u></a>
        in the recipe “Painting in oil on taffeta,” which suggests using starch
        water mixed with honey and alum water as an underlayer to prevent the
        oil “from running.”<a href="#fn47"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref47"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>47</sup></a> The author-practitioner also
        uses wheat starch to glue down kernels of grain in a vessel in order to
        effect a sleight of hand trick of magically moving a bushel of wheat
        from one vessel to another (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/35v/f/35v/tl"><u>35v</u></a>).<a

    <p>Perhaps the author-practitioner’s unusual usage of wheat starch as a
        mordant for gilding indicates that he viewed starch as an all-purpose
        adhesive, as these other uses are in recipes requiring an adhesive that
        is thin yet strong. Moreover, wheat starch adhesives can be made to
        different textures and clarity by adding water, without complete loss of
        their adhesive power.</p>
    <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>While the author-practitioner’s use of wheat starch as a mordant in
        gilding appears to be unusual, reconstruction of the recipes on fols. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/10v/f/10v/tl"><u>10v</u></a>
        and <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/29v/f/29v/tl"><u>29v</u></a>
        showed it to be an effective mordant (at least in the short term). After
        being burnished, the gilded papers and parchments achieved a smoothness
        and shine at least superficially similar to those in medieval and
        Renaissance illuminated manuscripts. The author-practitioner was likely
        aware of wheat starch pastes as adhesives for paper and parchment.
        Moreover, it may be significant that flour glues were employed by
        goldsmiths. For example, the twelfth-century text of Theophilus contains
        instructions for using a mixture of flour and water to hold together
        gems in gold settings before soldering.<a href="#fn49"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref49"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>49</sup></a> Being experienced in
        metalworking, the author-practitioner possibly extrapolated the use of a
        wheat based adhesive for gold in metalworking to an adhesive for gold on
        paper and parchment. Thus his use of this unusual mordant could indicate
        that he did not draw his recipe for this technique from another written
        source but instead extrapolated or extended processes he used in other
        domains of practice to a new yet related area.</p>

                <p>Cennino Cennini gives precise instructions how to make and
                    use such a shovel in his chapter on “The way to gild on
                    panel”: “Get a little piece of paper cut into a square,
                    bigger than the piece of gold, with all the corners cropped
                    [....] make sure that the gold protrudes from the paper by a
                    slither so that the little shovel made from paper does not
                    get wet” when you apply the leaf to the mordant: “Now, when
                    you have let the gold touch the water, immediately and very
                    quickly draw your hand, with the little shovel, towards
                    yourself. And if you see that the gold is not at all in
                    contact with the water, take a bit of new cotton and pat the
                    gold down as lightly as you possibly can. And lay other
                    pieces in the same way.” Cennini, <em>Cennino Cennini’s Il
