        <div>
            <p>Fifteenth and sixteenth-century artificial grottos were popular
                garden ornaments for Europe’s wealthiest elites. But in the late
                sixteenth century scholars have noted a growing prevalence of
                lightweight artificial grottos in theater productions and
                celebratory festivities. Multiple entries in Ms. Fr. 640 provide
                instructions for ornamenting an artificial grotto with
                lightweight materials. An historical study of literature
                thematically similar and contemporaneous to Ms. Fr. 640,
                followed by a reconstruction of the recipes for <em>Grottes</em>
                (Grottos) from fols. <a

                suggests that the artificial grotto the author-practitioner
                ornamented was likely intended for a festival.</p>

    <p>By the end of the sixteenth century, artificial grottos were an
        increasingly common feature of formal gardens, especially in Italy. The
        popularity of this architectural structure is reflected in Ms. Fr. 640’s
        multiple entries that detail grotto ornamentation: fols. <a

        Yet because historians have most often researched artificial European
        grottos of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries commissioned by elites,
        they have considered this garden feature accessible to only the very
        wealthy.<a href="#fn1"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref1"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> The presence of recipes detailing
        the use of relatively inexpensive and lightweight materials to ornament
        a grotto in Ms. Fr. 640 poses a historical question: for what use was
        the author-practitioner’s grotto intended?</p>
    <p>In this essay, I argue that Ms. Fr. 640’s use of lightweight materials,
        such as <em>colle forte</em> (“strong glue,” probably hide glue) to
        affix grotto ornaments, parchment for fashioning imitation rocks, and
        ground-up paper and glass to embellish them, suggests a grotto that was
        likely intended for a festival or celebration. Historical research on
        this question has led to the discovery that grotto recipes in Ms. Fr.
        640 appear to be most closely associated with garden grotto recipes of
        the early eighteenth century, but these later recipes also differ from
        those in Ms. Fr. 640 in their use of cement, a typical garden grotto
        adhesive far more durable than <em>colle forte</em>. The deliberate use
        of <em>colle forte</em> instead of cement in Ms. Fr. 640’s grotto,
        despite the presence in the manuscript of a recipe for the latter,
        suggests the author-practitioner’s grotto was likely ornamented for a
        temporary event, such as a carnival or a festival, rather than a
        garden.<a href="#fn2"

    <p>The popularity of artificial grottos, both garden grottos and miniature
        versions, endured through the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, with
        recipes appearing in a variety of popular collections, including art
        manuals, and even in newspapers, some of which were aimed explicitly
        toward an audience of women and children (<i><u>Fig. 1</u></i>).<a href="#fn3"

        Interestingly, these recipes appear to have a close relationship with
        the techniques for grotto construction in Ms. Fr. 640.</p>

    <p>The first known artificial grotto was constructed for the ducal House of
        Este in Ferrara in the second half of the fifteenth century, and many
        more were soon found in other parts of the Italian peninsula. Despite
        the circulation of architectural treatises prescribing the interior
        decor of an artificial grotto, no two grottos were alike.<a href="#fn4"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref4"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> In part because artificial
        grottos were modeled on natural grottos of antiquity, they often used or
        imitated materials and motifs found in natural grottos: rugged interior
        walls laden with protruding stones, jagged rocks covered with moss,
        glistening shells, branching textured coral, and myriad pebbles.<a

           class="footnote-ref"

        irregular interior spaces of caverns, despite the often classical lines
        of their supporting structures. Many grottos included elaborately
        designed rusticated fountains to evoke the springs and streams that
        often flowed through natural caverns (<i><u>Fig. 2</u></i>).<a href="#fn6"

        giraffes, elephants, camels, sheep, bears, rooks, crows, pigeons, owls,
        tortoises, eels and other sea creatures also decorated the grotto’s
        interior, bedecked the exterior of the fountain, or could be found
        inside the fountain’s basin with streams of jetting water cascading off
        them to brilliantly highlight their surfaces.<a href="#fn7"

    <p>Artificial grottos made their way to France in 1541. Under the patronage
        of Francis I (1494–1547), the Italian painter and architect Francesco
        Primaticcio (1504–1570) oversaw the construction of the first recorded
        French grotto, <em>Grotte des Pins</em>, at Fontainebleau (1541–1543),
        modeled on the rusticated <em>mode d’Italie</em>. Others were soon
        erected at La Bâtie d'Urfé (1551) and Meudon (1552–1560).<a href="#fn8"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref8"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> It was not long before the French
        developed a distinctive style: the Huguenot Bernard Palissy (1510–1589)
        built the first grotto made of glazed ceramics (1556–1564) for Anne de
        Montmorency. Nothing remains of this marvel, but Palissy detailed its
        interior embellishment in his <em>Recepte Véritable</em> (1563): it was
        a two-story structure; the first floor included a set of glazed columns
        positioned between six concave niches on each side, with each niche
        glazed in a different color and material.<a href="#fn9"

        beauty and skill that the Queen regent, Catherine de’ Medici
        (1519–1589), bestowed on Palissy the title <em>Inventeur des rustiques
            figulines du Roy</em>. Palissy went on to design one more grotto at
        the Tuileries for the Queen.<a href="#fn11"

    <p>Aside from their aesthetic beauty, artificial grottos were also
        sanctuaries of solitude and reflection, summer retreats from oppressing
        heat, and sites for lively intellectual exchanges (<i><u>Fig. 3</u></i>).<a href="#fn12"

        solitude and learning. And their verses spurred later humanists, often

    <p>Perhaps the most intriguing imagery invoked by a grotto was that of
        transformation and regeneration. Natural grottos were thought to be
        sites of transformative processes, their very walls exuding generative,
        coagulating waters, metaphorically giving birth to stones.<a
           href="#fn14"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref14"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> Often found near lakes and
        ponds, grottos were also frequented by snakes, lizards and frogs, all of
        which underwent transformative processes of their own: regenerating a
        tail, growing new skin, and evolving from a swimming tadpole into a
        four-legged amphibian. Artificial grottos amplified this imagery, and,
        through illusionism and imitation of natural grottos, they were viewed
        as reenacting the transformative processes.</p>
    <p>At a time when humanists and artisans increasingly looked to nature for
        inspiration and knowledge, some artisans, such as Palissy, believed that
        nature could be understood by imitating it through art or the work of
        the human hand. Palissy viewed his experiments with glazes as an
        above-ground investigation of processes that took place underground. He
        considered them, as he termed it, an “art of the earth.”<a href="#fn15"

           role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> Ms. Fr. 640 likewise reveals not
        only an interest in natural materials and processes, but the
        author-practitioner shows himself to be a keen observer of nature,
        describing the behavior of animals and the composition of earth and
        stones. Moreover, as artificial grottos were intended to imitate natural
        grottos, and the author-practitioner was demonstrably interested in
        imitations, an artificial grotto formed an appropriate subject for his
        interests.</p>
    <h2 id="grottos-for-festivals-and-theater-productions">Grottos for Festivals
        and Theater Productions </h2>
    <p>Artificial grottos were not only a garden ornament. Scholars have noted
        their presence in late sixteenth-century festivals and celebrations,
        including noble marriages.<a href="#fn16"

           id="fnref16"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> Festival grottos resembled their
        garden counterparts in overall design, as their walls were also layered
        with jagged rocks and showed elaborate shellwork, but instead of
        adorning a garden, they were built within life-size arches. Often
        commissioned on short notice, these grottos were presumably not built to
        last longer than the event for which they were intended. While no less
        lavish in appearance, the ephemeral nature of these grotto commissions
        saw artists use lightweight materials in clever and inventive ways.<a

        sprinkle over the imitation rock for luster and shine. Artificial
        grottos were also used in theatrical performances as <em>mise en

        intended for a garden, but for a festival, or a celebration. A survey of
        architectural literature contemporaneous with Ms. Fr. 640 confirms this,
        detailing instructions for the construction of a garden grotto only
        partially similar to those found in Ms. Fr. 640, to which we turn to

        Italian texts or with Italian rusticated grottos. As a basis of

        published in Latin in 1452, Leon Battista Alberti (1404–1472) writes

    <p>These sixteenth-century sources do not contain instructions similar to

        However, several recipes found in an eighteenth-century popular
        compilation, <em>The Laboratory or School of Arts</em>, translated from
        German by Godfrey Smith in 1738, similarly instruct the use of ore,

        A possible explanation may be that grotto recipes in both Ms. Fr. 640
        and <em>The Laboratory</em> were translations of an earlier German
        recipe for a grotto. If so, an expanded reprint of <em>The
            Laboratory</em> (1756) also includes alternative uses for artificial
        grottos that may shed light on the purpose of a grotto in Ms. Fr. 640.<a

    <h2 id="miniature-grottos">Miniature Grottos </h2>
    <p>Like the previous edition of <em>The Laboratory</em> (1738), the expanded
        version of 1756 begins with instructions for a traditional garden
        grotto, but includes more detail, with the grotto now boasting a water
        fountain, marbled pavement, and walls affixed with “amber, pieces of
        marble, agat, or whatever maybe agreeable to set off, embellish, and add
        grandeur and beauty to the place.”<a href="#fn33"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref33"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a> Yet the more intriguing aspect
        of this recipe is the construction and ornamentation of “grottos in
        miniature” for interior domestic use rather than for a garden. Smith
        includes two sets of instructions for a miniature grotto to be placed
        inside either a dining room for “elegant entertainment, or inside a
        dressing room for some private use, and for admiration” of ladies.<a

           role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a> His instructions are more
        detailed than for a traditional garden grotto. For the dining room,
        Smith instructs to place the grotto:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>within the wall in the nature of a beauset, to which the water might
            be easily conveyed by branches of small pipes. The depth should be
            of a semicircle, according to the width thereof, and the height
            proportionate to the room. The sides, and the arch over it, [to]
            line in imitation of rock-work, either with flint, oar, or lumps of
            melted glass, of various colours, intermixed with several sorts of
            moss… [with] little pedestals neatly carved and gilt, fixt at proper
            distances, in rows round the grotto, to put wine-glasses upon… the
            rock-work of the grotto being finished,... decorate and beautify it
            with the choicest of seashells, pieces of looking-glass, coral,
            spar, crystal and other things, as would add grandeur and luster to
            the performance.<a href="#fn35"

    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>By comparison, a grotto for a lady’s
        dressing room, Smith continues, is “not only to adorn her toilet, but
        likewise to make it serve instead of a dressing-box.”<a href="#fn36"

    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>Yet, according to Smith, miniature grottos
        could also serve as models on which to practice and experiment before a
        full-scale grotto is erected in the garden. Immediately before launching
        into his instructions for a miniature grotto, he cautions his readers
        “to provide themselves with a good design, before they set about their
        work,” for “if shells, especially in grottos are not put together or
        distributed in some order… they will have but little effect.”<a

        Italian painter Tintoretto (1518–1594) and the French painter Nicolas
        Poussin (1594–1665) probably used them. On a visit to the studio of
        Hague painter Samuel Smits in 1678, the Dutch painter Samuel van
        Hoogstraten (1627–1678) observed modeled wax miniatures of the scenes
        Smits wished to compose, including one with grottos:</p>
    <blockquote>

            competing to see who was the better musician. Elsewhere, Narcissus
            was gazing at himself in a crystal–clear spring, enamoured of his
            own reflection. The little gowns were made of painted white paper.
            This was first moistened and then folded in a generous and
            attractive manner. The trees were made from twigs of oak. The ground
            and grottoes were intelligently constructed of moss and the water

    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>While the author-practitioner does not
        provide the dimensions or the purpose of his grotto, his use of
        lightweight materials, unlikely to weather a winter or inclement
        weather, such as parchment, paper and <em>colle forte</em>, makes a
        garden setting unlikely. Instead, Ms. Fr. 640’s grotto was likely
        proportioned and ornamented to resemble Smith’s miniature grottos.
        However, as the details of grotto recipes, indeed many recipes, were
        period specific, the author-practitioner's grotto was probably not for
        domestic use inside a dining or a dressing room—such practices seem to
        have been specific to the eighteenth century. Rather, it may have been
        an experimental model on which to design a larger version, or, more
        common to the author-practitioner’s context, his grotto was likely
        ornamented for a festival or celebration.<a href="#fn40"

        interest are parchment, <em>colle forte</em>, and ground-up paper, all
        of which stand out for their exceedingly lightweight qualities. Their
        inclusion suggests the grotto in Ms. Fr. 640 was likely not intended for
        a garden. In this reconstruction, only entries using parchment,
        <em>colle forte</em>, and ground up paper and glass were reconstructed.

        same ink (<i><u>Fig. 5</u></i>). The author-practitioner switched inks
        for the latter two entries, <em>Boutons de Vermeilles</em> and
        <em>Grottos</em>. Still, the entry for <em>Grottos</em> appears to be a
        stand-alone entry, as it bears no immediate relation to the remainder of

    <p>To fill some “empty space” in a grotto, the author-practitioner advises
        the reader to “put a piece of thick parchment close to the fire, which
        shrinks &amp; crumples.” The use of parchment is curious because
        parchment was not cheap, while tufa rocks, the very material the
        author-practitioner likely intended to imitate in this entry, abounded
        in the southern regions of France.<a href="#fn41"

           id="fnref41"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>41</sup></a> The expense of parchment coupled
        with the wording of the entry, “to fill some empty space,” suggest that
        the use of parchment was a last-minute addition to a commission on
        short-notice, which was typically the case in festivals or
        celebrations.<a href="#fn42"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref42"

        lighter than stone and would not require additional structural support.
        Light, temporary frames were often constructed for arches housing
        grottos, which necessitated the use of lightweight decorations.</p>
    <p>I began the reconstruction by using metal tongs to expose a small piece
        of rectangular parchment (probably calf) to heat generated by a
        hotplate. I increased the temperature incrementally to a medium heat
        until the parchment began to contort. The final product assumed a
        curious twisted shape with one protruding mound, followed by an
        undulating succession of smaller elevations. (<i><u>Vid. 1</u></i>) I
        heated another triangular piece of parchment, smaller in surface area
        with one thinly elongated side, over a hotplate set to high. Because the
        second piece of parchment was both thinner and smaller than the previous
        one, it abruptly folded in, then twisted out, then once more twisted in,
        and turned slightly out. Once it had finished contorting, I set aside
        the two pieces to be colored. On touch, both parchment pieces felt
        strong-bodied, and they proved difficult to bend or break even with the
        application of force. Evidently, exposure to heat did not weaken them (<i><u>Fig. 6</u></i>).<a

    <p>The recipe next advises to “paint it with distemper, then in oil.” This I
        did using two pigments, Bavarian Green Earth and Brown Earth Otranto.
        Over the course of two days, the pigments were first mixed with heated
        rabbit skin glue, which made them appear dull both immediately when
        applied and later when dried. The following day, the pigments were mixed
        with linseed oil instead of rabbit skin glue. The linseed oil gave the
        pigments a shine. On drying, the rocks retained the shine from the oil.
        In appearance, the imitation rocks looked quite the part of rocks; the
        only mistake was to have chosen Brown Earth pigment instead of gray, a
        more common rock color (<i><u>Fig. 7</u></i>).<a href="#fn44"

    <p>The author-practitioner advises the use of <em>colle forte</em>, or
        strong glue (probably hide glue), as a binding agent for all interior
        decorations, including tufa on fols. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/110r/f/110r/tl"><u>110r</u></a>
        and <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/118r/f/118r/tl"><u>118r</u></a>.
        The use of <em>colle forte</em> is curious because later recipes for
        garden grottos, including those found in Smith’s <em>Laboratory</em>
        (1738, 1739, 1740, 1750 and 1799),<a href="#fn45"

           role="doc-noteref"><sup>45</sup></a> recommend cement, which would
        withstand water and weather better than hide glue; this suggests the
        grotto recipe in Ms. Fr. 640 was not intended for a garden.<a
           href="#fn46"

           id="fnref46"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>46</sup></a> For my model artificial grotto,
        I used a wooden frame, which I lined with stretched linen. Historically,
        the walls of artificial grottos were built using either brick or stone,
        and, as Vasari and Serlio both suggest, were often coated with stucco.<a
           href="#fn47"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref47"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>47</sup></a> For brick or stone, the use of
        cement as a binding agent is more appropriate than <em>colle forte</em>.
        But for walls made of linen <em>colle forte</em> suffices. In fact,
        Serlio writes that walls can be layered with linen, onto which
        decorations can then be attached.<a href="#fn48"

    <p>The tufa rocks arrived in the lab as large rugged lumps. Their exterior
        surface proved as brittle as Alberti described, with a dense, tough
        core, but not as dense and tough as that of other rocks, for I
        eventually cut it with a kitchen knife. The inner walls of tufa were
        accurately described by Vasari “as sponge-like.”<a href="#fn49"

    <p>After having cut one large tufa rock into five smaller pieces, I made
        <em>colle forte</em> by heating rabbit skin glue. I then layered each
        cut side of the tufa rock with glue and attached each piece to the walls
        of my grotto. I experimented with different rock sizes, and in all
        instances the tufa rocks were affixed with ease, requiring no additional
        reinforcement (<i><u>Fig. 8</u></i>).<a href="#fn50"

        one entry, <em>Pour oster les baves ou barbes</em>, wedged between
        <em>Escargots</em> and <em>Pour grottes</em>. All five entries are
        written in the same ink and hand (<i><u>Fig. 9</u></i>). The most
        expansive recipe is <em>Pour grottes</em>. It includes the largest
        number of ingredients but offers very little detailed instruction. Among
        the list of ingredients suitable for ornamenting a grotto, the
        author-practitioner instructs to mix “pestled” paper with “pestled
        glass,” which is then applied to grotto walls using <em>colle
            forte.</em> He provides no further detail. The use of glass shards
        for grottos also appears in Vasari: “little bits of old bricks that have
        been too much baked, and pieces of glass which has run owing to the pans
        of glass bursting in an overheated furnace” are to be inserted “into the
        stucco on the wall” and arranged “between them corals and other spoils
        from the sea.”<a href="#fn51"

    <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion </h2>
    <p>Although the author-practitioner is not explicit about the purpose of
        ornamenting his grotto, historical research on garden grottos, later
        recipes in <em>The Laboratory</em>, as well as the use of parchment and
        paper, and <em>colle forte</em> as a binding agent, suggest Ms. Fr.
        640’s artificial grotto was likely not a garden grotto. The
        author-practitioner may have used it as a model grotto, as the
        eighteenth-century <em>The Laboratory</em> indicates, or, most likely,
        it was ornamented for a festival or celebration.</p>
    <p>Indeed, as previously mentioned, scholars have noted the presence of
        grottos in celebrations and festivals that could last for only days or
        weeks.<a href="#fn53"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref53"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>53</sup></a> The often brief time from
        commission to construction for these celebrations required the use of
        lightweight materials, such as parchment, paper, and <em>colle
            forte.</em> The successful reconstruction of the grotto recipes in
        Ms. Fr. 640 proves that lightweight materials are effective substitutes
        for traditional materials and do not detract from the naturalistic merit
        of the final product. This strengthens the assertion that the
        author-practitioner’s grotto was likely meant to be temporary.</p>
