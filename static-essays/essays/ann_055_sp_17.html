        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <div>
            <p>Innovations in distillation practices and technology in early
                modern Europe made possible the production of distillates in
                larger quantities. Such technologies became a prerequisite for a
                variety of modern-day applications in laboratory sciences and
                medicinal chemistry that followed. Ms. Fr. 640 provides
                testimony to this development: an illustration on fol. <a
                   href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/3v/f/3v/tl"><u>3v</u></a>
                of a distillation vessel raises questions about where this
                apparatus can be located within this context, as well as about
                the author-practitioner’s knowledge and practice of
                distillation. This essay considers the text and image of the
                entry in the context of the manuscript, and it speculates about
                the consequences of the entry’s overriding concern with the
                practical yield of the apparatus, in quantity, quality, and
                variety of products.</p>

    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
    <p>The entry “Thick varnish for planks,” beginning on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/3r/f/3r/tl"><u>3r</u></a>,
        contains a schematic illustration of a distillation vessel (<i><u>Fig. 1</u></i>) on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/3v/f/3v/tl"><u>3v</u></a>,
        along with a description of its ability to distill high quality
        turpentine and alcohol in large quantities. To understand the place of
        this device in the contemporaneous development of distillation
        technologies, this essay explores questions about where the
        author-practitioner obtained his information about distillation and why
        he was interested in it. After discussing the entry on fol. 3r-v and the
        accompanying illustration, I compare the distillation apparatus with
        other contemporaneous vessels and descriptions, and then I contextualize
        the entry by looking at other visual and textual representations of
        practical apparatuses and processes within the manuscript. I argue that
        it is likely the author-practitioner may have been more intent on
        addressing the practical needs of a distillation apparatus than on the
        means by which an apparatus works. One can posit that the
        author-practitioner himself may have learned of the vessel
        experientially, and thus he depicted the distillation apparatus as a
        practical object capable of specific outputs.</p>

    <p>Today, distillation is defined as a process of vaporizing a liquid
        mixture (known as a “distilland”) by heating it in a boiling vessel or
        pot and condensing the vapors of a component of the mixture (known as
        the “distillate”) on a cool surface into a receiver. The result of this
        process is the collection of more volatile liquid components of the
        mixture in the receiver and less volatile components in the original
        boiling vessel. In conventional modern distillation apparatuses, the
        original liquid mixture is placed in the boiling flask, and once the
        mixture reaches the vapor temperature, volatile liquid components will
        vaporize and condense on a slanted condenser continuously fed by cold
        water on its outside, yielding the collection of this component in the
        receiver.<a href="#fn1"

    <p>During the early modern period, practitioners developed these
        technologies and a diverse group of authors catalogued their techniques.

    </h2>
    <p>The only explicit description and visual representation of a distillation
        apparatus in Ms. Fr. 640 appears on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/3v/f/3v/tl"><u>3v</u></a>,
        in the context of entries on turpentine and its use for varnishing
        floorboards and panel paintings. The author-practitioner notes that this
        copper distillation vessel is able to produce large amounts of
        “turpentine oil” of particular qualities. He outlines a few of the
        parameters under which a distillation should be undertaken, noting that
        the process should start with low heat, which can be done without a
        furnace, and that this particular distillation apparatus has a still
        head cooled by flowing water. He then states the price one can get for
        the distilled turpentine and also mentions that the colophony, called
        <em>pix graeca</em>, remains in the vessel after a distillation. He also
        notes that the apparatus can produce alcohol in a single distillation.
    </p>
    <p>The author-practitioner’s sketch of the apparatus features the typical
        components of an early modern distillation apparatus:<a href="#fn9"

        distilland; a still head, or <em>ambix</em>, on which the vaporized
        distillate condenses; a delivery tube, or <em>solen</em>, protruding
        from the right side of the vessel, through which the condensed
        distillate is dispensed, and a collecting receptacle, known as the
        <em>bikos</em> (<i><u>Fig. 3</u></i>).<a href="#fn10"

    <p>Though the author-practitioner appears to be illustrating a particular
        type of distillation apparatus, he describes it in the accompanying text
        with the simple term “vessel” (<em>vaisseau</em>). Use of the word
        <em>vaisseau</em> elsewhere in the manuscript shows that it is a generic
        term used to indicate a receptacle for holding or storing things, rather
        than as a means of processing materials, such as through distillation.<a

           role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> Comparing the illustrated vessel
        to contemporary illustrations and descriptions of distillation
        apparatuses, it can be more or less identified as a Moor’s head alembic.
        This alembic featured a still head enclosed in cooling water, a
        technology believed to have been developed in the late fifteenth
        century.<a href="#fn12"

    <p>The author-practitioner’s sketch of the apparatus on fol. 3v closely
        resembles a printed image from the 1551 edition of Brunschwig’s
        <em>Distillierbuch der Rechten Kunst</em> (<i><u>Fig. 4</u></i>).<a

           role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> Both apparatuses (Fig. 3 and <i><u>Fig. 5</u></i>) feature a spigot on the left of the cooling

        vessel. The tube leaving the right of both apparatuses may indicate the
        same <em>solen</em> where the distillate could be dispensed.
        Brunschwig’s vessel, like that of fol. 3v, appears to enable the
        distillation of alcohols, as indicated by its caption: “The common
        distillation vessel / for spirits and other things / now most commonly
        used / at the top with a copper cooling kettle<a href="#fn15"

           role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> Brunschwig specifies the need
        for a copper condenser on top (<em>küpfferinen Külkessel</em>), but does
        not specify the composition of any other component of the vessel. This
        may indicate that it is the condenser which must be made from copper,
        which is logical, as the low specific heat of copper facilitates the
        cooling of the still head and the transfer of heat to the water and thus
        allows for efficient condensation of distillate products.</p>

    <p>The author-practitioner, on the other hand, notes that the entire vessel
        should be made from copper. It is not clear whether the cucurbit or
        other components of the vessel were also made from copper, but his
        recommendation to use tinned copper (i.e., copper plated with tin) to
        avoid a green color in the distillate may suggest the components besides
        the still head would also have been made from copper. Because the still
        head is one of the colder parts of the apparatus (because it is cooled
        by water), it is less likely that reactions with the copper would occur
        there.<a href="#fn17"

    <p>The author-practitioner’s description of the distillation apparatus
        raises questions about the quantity and quality of distillate that it
        produced. He reports that this apparatus is able to produce turpentine
        oil at the rate of “a bucket an hour.” It is not clear precisely what
        volume a “bucket” signifies, but the author-practitioner makes clear
        that it is used to produce “large quantities.”<a href="#fn18"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref18"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> He also describes its ability to
        make “fine” or “crude” turpentine though he does not specify how these
        different qualities are achieved through the distillation process. When
        writing about the distillation of alcohol in the same vessel, the
        author-practitioner states that “there is no need to distill it again.”
        This apparently speaks to the quality or purity of alcohol distillate
        that can be obtained with this vessel, and it seems to testify to the
        high efficiency achieved with this apparatus.<a href="#fn19"

           id="fnref19"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
    <p>The text of the entry, with its allusions to tacit knowledge (e.g., “as
        you know”), indicates that the author-practitioner had some familiarity
        with distillation techniques and expected as much from his reader. He
        suggests that one begin a distillation on low heat and, as Brunschwig
        also mentions, that one can maintain cold water within the still head
        throughout the process. The author-practitioner specifies the sale of
        turpentine distilled by his vessel, stating that it “is sold for 40 sous
        per lb,”<a href="#fn20"

        of fol. 3r-v within Ms. Fr. 640</h2>
    <p>There are diverse references to distillation, other distillation
        apparatuses and the products of distillation throughout Ms. Fr. 640.
        Chiefly, the author-practitioner mentions the use of an alembic for
        distillations of urine, azure and turpentine.<a href="#fn22"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref22"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a> The forms of the word “lembick,”
        “limbeck,” or the like were also used to describe the head of these
        distillation apparatuses from the fifteenth to seventeenth centuries,
        and this terminology also occurs in Ms. Fr. 640.<a href="#fn23"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref23"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
    <p>In his references to alembics, the author-practitioner specifies that a
        copper vessel should be used. In the entry, “To relieve the pain of G.,”
        probably referring to gout, he writes that a distillation of imbibed
        urine should be done “in an alembic, well-luted &amp; covered with a
        copper helmet” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/7v/f/7v/tl"><u>7v</u></a>).
        In yet another entry on “Painting <em>esmail d’azur</em> in oil,” he
        writes about a “rock water,” that is, “a water distilled from mines
        where azure or <em>vert d’azur</em> is found, which distills naturally
        through the veins of the mountain or is distilled through an alembic
        from mineral stones of azure or copper” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/11r/f/11r/tl"><u>11r</u></a>).
    </p>
    <p>While the author-practitioner noted his interest in the market value of
        distilled turpentine, he was also interested in the product left over
        after such a distillation. The description of the distillation vessel
        mentions a colophony known as <em>pix graeca</em>, or “Greek pitch,”
        that remains after a distillation. Though there is never another
        reference within the manuscript to <em>pix graeca</em> directly, there
        is a reference to the making of colophony on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/3r/f/3r/tl"><u>3r</u></a>.
        The author-practitioner states that it is “nothing other than recooked
        rosin.” The rest of the entry focuses on the production of colophony, in
        which the author-practitioner implies that it does not directly involve
        any sort of distillation procedure or the like. However, given the
        placement of the descriptions and making of colophony on the same single
        folio page as the distillation entry, it seems as though the entries on
        colophony and on distillation complement each other. The distillation
        entry on fol. 3r-v may serve to explain another “origin” of the
        materials outlined in a previous entry on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/3r/f/3r/tl"><u>3r</u></a>
        focusing on colophony.</p>
    <p>Contemporary sources on colophony echo the author-practitioner’s brief
        remarks. Charles Estienne’s <em>L’agriculture et maison rustique</em>
        briefly makes reference to colophony as a melted substance that can be
        used for “diseases of the flanks” in oxen in a chapter on “the
        neat-heard,” or cowherd.<a href="#fn24"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref24"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a> Conrad Gesner refers to
        colophony in his <em>Thesaurus Euonymi Philiatri de remediis
            secretis</em> as a byproduct of balms intended “to close and heale
        wounds &amp; biles,” including those prepared by distillation and/or
        with turpentine.<a href="#fn25"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref25"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a> These references reinforce the
        notion that the distillation of turpentine under heat was also a major
        source of colophony.</p>
    <p>Just as we can situate the entry on fol. 3r-v within a network of
        information about distillation that extends throughout the manuscript,
        we can also compare the author-practitioner’s sketch of the distillation
        apparatus with his other drawings in Ms. Fr. 640. Perhaps the most
        notable feature about the various illustrations in the manuscript is the
        high variability among them. Whereas an illustration such as that found
        on fol. 3v is rather schematic and simple, that of fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/54v/f/54v/tl"><u>54v</u></a>
        illustrating a contraption for drying jams (<i><u>Fig. 6</u></i>), for
        instance, is extremely detailed not only its depiction of component
        parts, but also in the artistic attention paid to it, including the
        shading to illustrate liquid and the cross-hatching motif representing
        the sieve described in the text.</p>

    <p>Two folios feature illustrations similar in execution to that on fol. 3v.
        The entry titled “Fountains” on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/80r/f/80r/tl"><u>80r</u></a>
        describes a means by which one can raise water from a lower to higher
        area. This entry is similar to that of the distillation apparatus, as
        both involve the processing and movement of a liquid medium. Also, they
        both include illustrations of the apparatuses as well as textual
        indications of their wider practical purposes. On fol. 80r, the
        author-practitioner goes into great detail about how to assemble such a
        contraption in order to achieve this end, and this is reflected in the
        three illustrations devoted to the practice of feeding fountains with
        water (<i><u>Fig. 7</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 8</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 9</u></i>). The author-practitioner demarcated certain components of one such
        device with letters, which suggests he could have had a construction of
        this contraption in mind or was copying the construction from another
        source. The illustrations here are similarly schematic to the diagram on
        fol. 3v for distillation.</p>

    <p>Perhaps the strongest parallel to fol. 3r-v entry within Ms. Fr. 640 in
        terms of the subject of an illustration is that of fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/102r/f/102r/tl"><u>102r</u></a>.
        The illustration featured here is of a glass vessel which, like that on
        fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/80r/f/80r/tl"><u>80r</u></a>,
        is achieved with a degree of artistic finesse, as the cross-hatching and
        curved lines accentuate the form of the vessel (<i><u>Fig. 10</u></i>).
        However, what is most intriguing about this entry is the text associated
        with it. Although very simple, the glass vessel has very clearly
        outlined specifications, including the particular shape and a relative
        sense of scale with respect to easily accessible objects, such as knife
        handles, Dutch feathers, and fingers. Both of these features completely
        juxtapose the comparable features of the illustration and text of fol.
        3v, in which the illustration is quite schematic and the text offers
        little with regards to the dimensions of the vessel, even though both
        illustrations concern similar subjects. However, more noteworthy perhaps
        are the allusions to distillation apparatuses on the same folio. Further
        up the page is an entry for the “Provisions for the work of Colchis,”
        which simply features a list of materials (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/102r/f/102r/tl"><u>102r</u></a>).
        Among these materials are “7 retorts,”<a href="#fn26"

    <p>Ultimately, the fol. 3r–v entry and illustration appear to be
        observational rather than a set of instructions. It is not detailed
        enough for a reader to fully understand the mechanism of distillation,
        and thus the apparatus cannot be reconstructed on the basis of the entry
        alone. Rather, it is a way for the reader to understand the practical
        value of the apparatus and its products.</p>

        Technological Developments in Vessel Cooling Technologies</h2>
    <p>One of the most innovative aspects of the vessel depicted on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/3v/f/3v/tl"><u>3v</u></a>
        is its cooling system. The development of a water-cooled copper still
        head likely began with attempts to perform distillations of alcohols and
        the need for precise cooling methods and heating control during
        distillation processes as well as for collecting a desirable yield of
        pure alcohol products.<a href="#fn28"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref28"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a> As such, a crucial aspect of
        proper distillation of alcohols is the means of cooling different

        in a worm-like shape (canalem serpentinum), to further cool the delivery
        tube.<a href="#fn32"

    <p>Later, innovations in distillation technologies focused on the cooling of
        the still head rather than of the solen, using more continuous and
        rigorous cooling methods than the replaceable sponges or wet rags used
        previously. This, in conjunction with the need to collect distillates in
        fraction with a low boiling point, resulted in the development of the
        <em>Rosenhut</em> and the “Moor’s head.” The <em>Rosenhut</em>, the
        earlier of the two alembics and observed in a fully fleshed out form by
        1478, was a conical rimmed alembic sitting on a wide-mouthed cucurbit
        and often made from metals because of their high thermal conductivity
        for efficient cooling by air.<a href="#fn33"

        Distillation Practices Contemporaneous with Ms. Fr. 640</h2>
    <p>When considering larger-scale production and sale of distilled products,
        apothecaries appear to have played a considerable role from the late
        twelfth century and, to a lesser extent, vintners and innkeepers.<a
           href="#fn35"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref35"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>35</sup></a> Furthermore, in France
        specifically, the distillers trade was controlled by the state from
        1619. Distillation remained a craft reserved for apothecaries and
        spice-merchants until 1624 and 1634, when statutes were implemented for
        distillers to be placed within the apothecary guild. The distillers
        gained their own guild in 1637.<a href="#fn36"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref36"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
    <p>The distillation of essential oils was mostly restricted to monasteries,
        especially those that had herb gardens, although by the fourteenth
        century, the plants for essential oils, such as lavender, could be grown
        on large plantations, such as those in Burgundy. These plants were
        distilled with water or alcohol in a high-throughput manner, using many
        stills.</p>
    <p>Where did the author-practitioner of Ms. Fr. 640 gain his knowledge of
        the distillation apparatus on fol. 3v? The most extensive works on
        distillation practices at this time were those of Hieronymus Brunschwig.
        As noted above, Brunschwig’s <em>Distillierbuch der rechten kunst</em>
        depicts a distillation apparatus closely resembling the vessel on fol.
        3v. At the time of the writing of Ms. Fr. 640, it appears Brunschwig’s
        works were not translated or readily available in French, thus making it
        less likely that the author-practitioner would have read his works. This
        does not preclude the author-practitioner having knowledge of Brunschwig
        and his apparatuses in German, as the author-practitioner was familiar
        with German materials and practices.<a href="#fn37"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref37"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>37</sup></a> Conrad Gesner, whose “de
        lapidibus” is mentioned in a margin of Ms. Fr. 640, also discusses

           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref38"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>38</sup></a> but the closest source of
        distillation practices to the author-practitioner was Charles Estienne’s
        <em>Maison Rustique</em>. It highlights several characteristics of
        distilling alcohols, essential oils and other forms of liquid products.
        Estienne outlines the ways in which <em>aqua vitae</em> is distilled,
        describing the vessels and procedures, aiming, like the description on
        fol. 3v, for high yield. He also describes the consequences of multiple
        distillations, including the relative amount of product and quality of
        the distillate. He likewise uses the same unit of “bucket” as a means of
        quantification of product yield. Finally, and perhaps most notably,
        Estienne includes details about the distillation vessels, including
        those made from copper.<a href="#fn39"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref39"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>39</sup></a> One particular illustration

        collection components illustrated by the author-practitioner (<i><u>Fig. 13</u></i>). Since this vessel also closely resembles the common
        distillation vessel of Brunschwig, it is probable that Estienne drew
        inspiration from Brunschwig’s work, and in turn it is possible that the
        author-practitioner of Ms. Fr. 640 may have drawn inspiration from
        Estienne’s work.</p>

    <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Distillation was of great interest during the early modern period, and it
        is not surprising to find that the author-practitioner was aware of and
        showed interest in the process. This essay has contextualized his
        description and visual representation of the distillation process using
        a Moor’s head alembic with a water-cooled still head. Brunschwig’s
        nearly identical vessel in the <em>Distillierbuch der Rechten
            Kunst</em>, or Estienne’s description may have been the basis of the
        sketch on fol. 3v, or the author-practitioner might simply have observed
        such vessels being used. Neither the author-practitioner’s description
        of the vessel nor the accompanying drawing provide enough details for a
        reader to reconstruct the apparatus, and thus the author-practitioner’s
        interest appears to have been in practical processes and the products
        that could be produced with relatively novel technologies—namely, with a
        water-cooled copper condenser. His apparent interest in the commercial
        aspects of these distilled products may likewise prove significant for
        interpreting other sections of the manuscript. Ultimately, his interest
        in distillation appears not unlike his interest in many other processes
        described throughout the manuscript, that is, motivated by practical
        uses and interest in the means of transforming materials.</p>

                <p>In fact, there are only two other detailed references to the
                    use of a specific type of vessel: on fol. 34v, where the
                    vessels are used “for melting or transmuting a jewel put
                    inside a box” through a system of interlocking cylindrical
                    vessels depicted at the top of the folio; and on fol. 35v,
                    “for transmuting grain from one vessel to another” depicted
                    in the left margin. In both cases, the merit of the use of a
                    vessel lies in the particular shape and size of the vessel
                    rather than its use as an active component of an apparatus,
                    such as on fol. 3v. This is especially emphasized by the
                    lettered labelling of different parts of the vessels that
                    are referred to in the text associated with the

                <p>I was unable to find anything conclusive about a unit for a
                    “bucket.” In his French-English dictionary, Randle Cotgrave
                    defines a <em>seau</em> (in the original French of the
                    manuscript entry) as “a bucket, or water pale; also, a seale
                    or signet; also, the chiefe <em>Luminaire</em> (wreatbed, or
                    in works) of wax used at funeralls,” a definition that still
                    does not indicate the use of the word <em>seau</em> as a
                    unit. See Randle Cotgrave, <em>A Dictionarie of the French
                        and English Tongues</em> (London: Adam Islip, 1611),
                    s.v. “seau,” Online, <a
                       href="http://www.pbm.com/~lindahl/cotgrave/"><u>http://www.pbm.com/~lindahl/cotgrave/</u></a>.
                    This led me to wonder whether the use of “bucket” as a
                    measure was an arbitrary unit rather than an established
                    one. It may be possible in this case that “bucket” is
                    relative to the size of the distillation vessel in use or
                    refers to a part of the vessel itself. This could be
                    logical, since a scale is not given by the illustration or
                    text of this folio, so any statements about quantification
                    of the product yield would have to relative to the scale of
                    any given apparatus rather than by a concrete standard.<a

                <p>A student essay by Marianne Nuij, “The Use of eau-de-vie in
                    the Reconstruction of Dragon’s Blood,” University of
                    Amsterdam, Spring 2015, explores distillation of eau-de-vie.
                    Nuij examines the same phrase used by the
                    author-practitioner and concludes that this contradicted
                    other references to eau-de-vie found throughout the rest of
                    the manuscript, where it is specified to need multiple
                    distillations to be of the highest quality. When assessing
                    the definition of “quality” with respect to eau-de-vie, Nuij
                    proposes a reference to higher alcohol content as a result
                    of multiple distillations. However, this raises questions
                    about the reason why the author-practitioner specifies that
                    multiple distillations are not necessary with the fol. 3v
                    apparatus. The root of the question becomes whether the
                    other references to eau-de-vie and its quality as a result
                    of the number of distillations performed are with respect to
                    the apparatus the author-practitioner outlines on fol. 3v or
                    not. Perhaps the other references that require multiple
                    distillations for higher quality eau-de-vie are in fact with
                    respect to other typical distillation apparatuses that
                    cannot achieve the potency that his specified apparatus can
                    with simply one distillation.<a href="#fnref19"

                <p>As knowledge of distillation was codified by Islamic
                    philosophers in the seventh and eighth centuries, the ambix
                    was dubbed <em>al-anbîq</em>, giving rise to the term
                    <em>alembic</em>. Starting in the tenth century, the terms
                    <em>alembic</em> and <em>ambix</em> would denote the name of
                    both the component of the vessel as well as a specific form
                    of distillation vessel in which the cucurbit and alembic
                    were combined into a single segment. Rasmussen, <em>The

                <p>This technology was recorded by Magister Salernus, a
                    physician of Salerno in the 1100s who wrote about medical
                    endeavors such as pathology and therapeutics. With this
                    modification, since the delivery tube was cooler than the
                    still head of the apparatus, the “lip” in the medieval
                    alembic disappeared, as distillate was no longer collected
                    in the still head of an apparatus, and the cooling of the
                    solen became a focal point of adjustment of condensation
                    outside of the still head. Rasmussen, <em>The Quest for Aqua

                <p>Many early stills used materials such as glazed earthenware
                    or metals, though such stills could result in toxic products
                    and were generally avoided. Though glass stills were in use,
                    their utility was limited, as early glasses were often
                    fragile and susceptible to melting or shattering at high
                    temperatures. Starting in the thirteenth century, however,
                    glass vessels made in Venice became better able to withstand
                    heat stress, and cucurbits and alembics could be constructed
                    in this improved glass. By the late fifteenth century, glass
                    components, especially those from Venice, were explicitly
                    specified by sixteenth-century authors Hieronymus Brunschwig

                <p>This was a precedent for later methods of collecting
                    distillate inside the alembic itself. As a result of this
                    innovation, it may have been possible to achieve up to 90%
                    alcohol content by volume, as this method was the only
