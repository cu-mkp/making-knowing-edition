        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <div>
            <p>A single recipe in Ms. Fr. 640, on fol. <a
                   href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/126r/f/126r/tl"><u>126r</u></a>,
                gives instructions for making sugar casts of fresh fruits. Such
                cast sugar sculpture was a common sight at lavish banquets held
                in sixteenth-century European courts and cities. The
                author-practitioner provides practical instruction and tips for
                making this delicacy, but also frames his instructions within a
                set of properties that sugar exhibits as it changes from solid
                to liquid and back to solid. According to the
                author-practitioner, in its nature, sugar is by turns fatty,
                brittle, and sour. This essay explains the meaning of these
                properties within the author-practitioner’s material imaginary,
                and our reconstruction clarifies how this material imaginary
                provided a coherent supporting framework for the practical
                actions described in the recipe.</p>

        sugar</h2>
    <p>The full-page recipe on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/126r/f/126r/tl"><u>126r</u></a>
        details steps for molding fruits in plaster, then casting them with
        molten sugar. The recipe begins by considering the properties of sugar
        and the transformations that occur as sugar changes from one state to
        another:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Sugar is fatty <sup>when runny and brittle &amp; breakable when
                dry</sup>, and with it, one casts well round things &amp; large
            muscles, but awkwardly things fine &amp; delicate [...]. One needs
            also for it to be of easy release, for the sugar is sour &amp;
            brittle.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>Here, the author-practitioner notes that
        sugar is fatty (<em>gras</em>) when liquid, but “brittle and breakable
        when dry” (<em>brusc &amp; rompa{n}t esta{n}t sec</em>). But he also
        notes that “sugar is sour &amp; brittle” (<em>aigre &amp; brusc</em>).
        Moreover, sugar is sticky with a tendency to adhere to the mold:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>try well-clarified sugar. One needs to soak for one night or one day
            the plaster mold before casting the sugar, in order that it is very
            full of water &amp; does not imbibe the syrup. One needs also for it
            to be of easy release...</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>His concern with stickiness is also the
        subject of a marginal comment:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>If the sugar sticks, one needs to throw some wheat starch in the mold
            or rub it with an almond.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>The author-practitioner also cautions his
        reader to use fresh fruit because the molding technique results in a
        perfect simulacrum of whatever is molded:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>If you want to mold a bunch of grapes, one needs to take it, like any
            other fruit, in its true vigor, for if it is withered, it will <em>
                <del>ne</del>
            </em> come out that way. Take heed, therefore, to make your molds in
            the natural season of <em>
                <del>que</del>
            </em> all things.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>He then turns to the difficulty of casting
        fruits of complex shape:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Finally, do not consider casting anything in sugar that does not
            release well and that cannot be neatly molded in two halves, to open
            it when you will need to [...]. The grapes that are usually wanted
            cast in sugar can be made artificially or with wax or earth, or even
            with some grapes attached with some melted wax on some slab &amp;
            other full thing, so that they are very close together and release
            well, &amp; only make up one half. Or, if you have some of those
            grapes called <em>chauchés</em> or <em>sauvignons</em>, which have
            the grapes very close together, encase half of them <del>on</del> in
            the clay slab and cast on the other half. And if some grape is not
            released, pluck it out. Note that neither in sugar, nor in metal,
            can a bunch which has light &amp; separated grapes be cast properly,
            because the end of the bunch is so delicate, especially if the
            grapes are kept, that it could not sustain the large grapes. Thus,
            you will need to cast hollow, which you could not do if the bunch
            does not have the grapes close together &amp; <del>molds</del>
            without having them scattered &amp; spread apart.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>He adds further notes on molding and on
        the process of boiling and casting the sugar in the left margin. These
        details give the impression of first-hand experience:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>To cast pears &amp; apples in sugar, one ought not to make any gates,
            but rather, fill one half of the mold and then join the two, and
            keep turning it until the sugar has set and is cold. One ought to
            mix nothing in the mold apart from plaster, reheated as you know.
        </p>
        <p>***</p>
        <p>One needs for the mold to have soaked one day and one night in cold
            water <del>for</del>, and to be humid, when you cast in sugar.</p>
        <p>***</p>
        <p>The sign that the syrup or the sugar melted in water is sufficiently
            cooked to cast fruits, is when it makes threads when shaking it. And
            if it passes that point, it is not good, for it will always be
            humid. If the sugar attaches to it, one needs to throw some wheat
            starch in the mold or rub it with an almond.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>On fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/31r/f/31r/tl"><u>31r</u></a>,
        in “Fruit made from sugar,” the author-practitioner adds detail about
        decorating the sugar casts:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>One does not paint them with a paintbrush like other <em>
                <del>s</del>
            </em> things with moistened color, because the sugar would melt. But
            one rubs them with color with the finger.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>These are the only two entries in Ms. Fr.
        640 that discuss the process of making sugar casts. They provide much
        information about the author-practitioner’s understanding of the nature
        and properties of sugar: it can melt into a liquid, it can make threads
        when heated, and it can be dry and brittle; it is both “fatty”
        (<em>gras</em>) and “sour and brittle” (<em>aigre &amp; brusc</em>); and
        it is sticky. This entry also gives rich detail on the method of making
        molds and casting sugar. Our reconstruction confirmed the usefulness of
        the author-practitioner’s advice in this recipe, and allowed us to
        consider the nature of sugar within the author-practitioner’s material
        imaginary.</p>
    <h2 id="reconstruction">Reconstruction</h2>
    <p>Guided by the author-practitioner’s knowledge of the properties of sugar,
        we chose to cast a pear and a bunch of grapes, using fresh fruit (in
        “its true vigor” and “natural season”).<a href="#fn7"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref7"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> We first pressed the fruit into
        clay (<i><u>Fig. 1</u></i>). With the pear, we heeded the
        author-practitioner’s advice not to “consider casting anything in sugar
        that does not release well and that cannot be neatly molded in two
        halves, to open it when you will need to” (<i><u>Fig. 2</u></i>).</p>

    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>The bunch of grapes was much more
        complicated, and the author-practitioner spends most of the second half
        of the entry on instructions for grapes:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>The grapes that are usually wanted cast in sugar can be made
            artificially or with wax or earth, or even with some grapes attached
            with some melted wax on some slab &amp; other full thing, so that
            they are very close together and release well, &amp; only make up
            one half. Or, if you have some of those grapes called
            <em>chauchés</em> or <em>sauvignons</em>, which have the grapes very
            close together, encase half of them <del>on</del> in the clay slab
            and cast on the other half.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>Our grapes were not closely-spaced so we
        brushed melted wax onto the bunch in order to facilitate an easy release
        from the mold (<i><u>Fig. 3</u></i>). The wax filled in voids that would
        create undercuts in the mold and make both the fresh grapes and their
        simulacra in sugar impossible to remove from the mold (<i><u>Fig. 4</u></i>). We prepared the bunch of grapes to “encase half of them <del>on
        </del> in the clay slab and cast on the other half” (<i><u>Fig. 5</u></i>). With our clay bases and mold walls complete (<i><u>Fig. 6</u></i>), we poured plaster (<i><u>Fig. 7</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 8</u></i>).</p>

    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>We then prepared the sugar and mixture
        water. Like other contemporary texts, the recipe lacks specific
        instructions on the ratio of sugar to water. In <em>Ouverture de
            Cuisine</em>, written in France in 1604, Master Lancelot de Casteau
        explains to his master cook “to prepare&nbsp;sugar&nbsp;for casting
        images &amp;&nbsp;fruits: mix
        melted&nbsp;sugar&nbsp;with&nbsp;rose&nbsp;water as much as you would
        like to have, &amp; let it boil a long&nbsp;time&nbsp;until it becomes
        like syrup.”<a href="#fn8"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref8"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> Other recipes are similar,
        instructing the reader to dissolve as much sugar as is reasonable, which
        suggests that the making of sugar syrup was widely known and practiced.
    </p>
    <p>Although we had to guess at the ratio of sugar to water (<i><u>Fig.
                18</u></i>), the recipe provided a visual sign for when the
        sugar is ready: “the sign that the syrup or the sugar melted in water is
        sufficiently cooked to cast fruits, is when it makes threads when
        shaking it” (“<em>quand il faict des filets en le secouant</em>”). This
        advice raised questions as to what shaking is and what the threads will
        look like. Other contemporary recipes also include such a visual sign:
        most often that the sugar should be boiled to a specific height in the
        pot.<a href="#fn9"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref9"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> But our research into
        confectionery manuals illuminated the thread test. Food historian Ivan
        Day describes an eighteenth-century system of reading the sugar’s
        behavior as it changes temperatures, based on the length of the thread
        it creates. The clear syrup is tested by dipping the tip of one’s
        forefinger in the solution, pressing it onto the thumb, and then slowly
        separating the fingers. If the sugar is ready a short thread will form;
        if the sugar is boiled a little longer this thread will extend to about
        a quarter of a stretched forefinger and thumb, and the syrup is
        considered at “the great thread degree.”<a href="#fn10"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref10"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> Fortunately for the safety of
        our fingers, another recipe for casting sugar advises testing the degree
        of the syrup with a wooden spoon. In Hugh Plat’s <em>Delightes for
            ladies to adorne their persons, tables, closets, and distillatories
            with beauties, banquets, perfumes and waters</em>, one boils the
        syrup “till by powring [pouring] some out of a spoone, it will run at
        the last as fine as a haire.”<a href="#fn11"
           class="footnote-ref"

           role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> Using the spoon method to test
        the syrup, we discovered this to be the case after about an hour of
        boiling the sugar. When we removed the wooden spoon, the syrup did not
        drip from the spoon, but rather formed a long thread from the spoon into
        the pot (<i><u>Fig. 19</u></i>). This thread indicated the sugar syrup
        was ready to be cast.</p>

    <p>We then poured the sugar into one of the two molds, both of which were

    <p>While we were pouring the sugar into the second mold, the solution began
        to change suddenly and dramatically: the sugar began to bubble so
        furiously (<i><u>Fig. 24</u></i>) that, as we poured it into the plaster
        mold, it bubbled over the sides of the mold (<i><u>Fig. 25</u></i>), and
        continued to spread (<i><u>Fig. 26</u></i>). The syrup turned from clear
        to white and thickened into a paste. Almost immediately after we poured
        the second mold, the remaining sugar in the pan ceased to be liquid,
        becoming a crystallized solid mass (<i><u>Fig. 27</u></i>). We went back
        to the recipe text and read again the marginal note that “ if the sugar
        sticks, one needs to throw some wheat starch [<em>amydon</em>] in the
        mold or rub it with an almond.” Randle Cotgrave defines <em>amydon</em>
        as “Fine wheat flower steeped in water, then strained, and let stand
        untill it settle at the bottome; then drained of the water, and dried at
        the Sunne.”<a href="#fn12"

    <p>Our research turned up many modern-day recipes for making sugar candy
        that explained the process of melting sugar in water. We found that
        sugar is extremely hygroscopic, meaning it absorbs water very readily.
        When a solution is over-saturated with sugar, the solution is considered
        extremely unstable and has a high tendency to recrystallize.<a

        its chemistry will result in its reverting to its crystalline state.

    <p>This reconstruction showed us that the nature of sugar and its various
        qualities of—in the author-practitioner’s words—“fatty when runny and
        brittle &amp; breakable when dry,” as well as of stickiness and its
        associated sourness, were components of a knowledge system that gave
        meaning to the qualitative assessments advised by the
        author-practitioner at the various stages of casting sugar. This system
        of knowledge—or “material imaginary”—underlay the sensory observation
        and the concrete practical actions performed by the author-practitioner
        in the course of the process.</p>
    <h2 id="the-material-imaginary-of-sugar">The Material Imaginary of Sugar
    </h2>
    <p>In the author-practitioner’s telling, sugar is a transformative material
        with multiple properties. Sugar transforms from one state to another,
        and as it does so, it takes on new properties—the author-practitioner
        begins the entry on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/126r/f/126r/tl"><u>126r</u></a>
        by noting that “sugar is fatty,” but then he rethinks this statement,
        and adds a note above the line of text (indicated by the superscript):
        “Sugar is fatty <sup>when runny and brittle &amp; breakable when
            dry</sup>.” He thereby qualifies his statement to make clear that
        sugar is fatty when liquefied, which gives it particularly useful
        properties for casting round forms (such as “large muscles”). But when
        it dries and hardens (what we would call crystallization), it is brittle
        (“one casts well round things &amp; large muscles, but awkwardly things
        fine &amp; delicate”). Later in the recipe, however, the
        author-practitioner warns about yet another set of sugar’s
        characteristics when he notes that, “one needs also for [the mold] to be
        of easy release, for the sugar is sour &amp; brittle.” The attribution
        of these quite different sets of properties to sugar merits further
        investigation. Although the terms fatty and dry may at first be
        unfamiliar to us, his statement makes sense when viewed in the light of
        other statements in Ms. Fr. 640 and other contemporaneous technical
        writings.<a href="#fn16"

    <h3 id="sugar-as-fatty">Sugar as Fatty</h3>
    <p>In his article “The Qualities of Fat: Bodies, History, and Materiality,”
        Chris Forth describes conceptions of fat from antiquity through the
        early modern period. The terms “fat” and “lean” were used to describe
        qualities of soil starting in antiquity, with fat soil considered
        fertile, having the distinctive tactile qualities of oil or grease.<a
           href="#fn17"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref17"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> We noted that the liquified
        sugar left our fingers feeling greasy.</p>
    <p>Theophrastus, successor of Aristotle at the Lyceum, organized fat and
        lean soils into a taxonomic system, passed on to Roman writers, which
        provided a framework for how soils should be modified and farmed.<a
           href="#fn18"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref18"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> Virgil described the tactile
        qualities of fat sand, as felt by the experienced farmer: “never does it
        crumble when worked in the hands, but like pitch grows sticky in the
        fingers when held.”<a href="#fn19"

        Fr. 640 notes several times the stickiness of sugar.</p>
    <p>In addition to the unctuous, pliable, and adhering qualities discerned by
        the hand, fat soil was said to exhibit a tendency to swell. Forth
        discusses a test to determine if soil is fat and fertile described in
        the Roman author Columella’s <em>De re rustica</em> (On Agriculture):
        one removes a handful of soil and then reinserts it into the hole. “If
        there is an excess as by some sort of leavening, it will be a sure sign
        that the soil is fat; if it is insufficient, that it is poor; if it
        makes an even fill, that it is ordinary.”<a href="#fn20"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref20"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> The author-practitioner refers
        to the tendency of fatty sand to puff up (<em>soufler</em>), creating
        bubbles (perhaps analogous to the “leavening” of fat earth) and porosity
        in metal castings. On fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/85r/f/85r/tl"><u>85r</u></a>,
        for example, fatty sand “makes things porous. Thus, soft lead does not
        come out so well,” and on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/86r/f/86r/tl"><u>86r</u></a>
        “once fatty &amp; even, it becomes porous &amp; does not receive fine
        features.” Sugar, insofar as it is fatty, is likewise poor for receiving
        subtle impressions of metal, as the author-practitioner mentions in the
        recipe for sugar casting: it is good for casting “round things &amp;
        large muscles, but [casts] awkwardly things fine &amp; delicate” (fol.
        <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/126r/f/126r/tl"><u>126r</u></a>).
        In addition, in our reconstruction, the sugar bubbled up in the
        mold—perhaps indicating to the author-practitioner a kind of leavening
        that tends to porosity.</p>
    <p>Interestingly, the author-practitioner never mentions what we would
        consider as the overriding character of sugar—its sweetness—but this can
        be seen to be latent in the fattiness of sugar: we know that fatty means
        unctuous, dense, and malleable, and these qualities can create smooth,
        rounded surfaces. These large rounded forms (such as “large muscles”)
        could then withstand sugar’s brittle and breakable state when dry,
        whereas “fine &amp; delicate” forms are fragile. Within the
        author-practitioner’s material imaginary, softness of form can also be
        conceived of as “sweet”: the author-practitioner speaks often about the
        painter’s technique of using shadowing to create the impression of
        three-dimensional relief in rounded surfaces, which is known as
        “<em>adoulcir</em>,” which can be translated as “softening” or
        “sweetening” (see, e.g., fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/64r/f/64r/tl"><u>64r</u></a>–<a

    </p>
    <h3 id="sugar-as-sour">Sugar as Sour</h3>
    <p>For the author-practitioner, however, sugar is also sour (<em>aigre</em>)
        and brittle (<em>brusc</em>), which are quite different properties
        again. According to Randal Cotgrave, <em>aigre</em> is defined as
        “sharp, tart, biting, sower; also, brittle, or easily broken (with a
        hammer.)”<a href="#fn21"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref21"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a> Other mentions of <em>aigre</em>
        in the manuscript contrast it with <em>doulx</em> (or <em>doux</em>),
        which, according to Cotgrave, means “sweet, delicious, dantie, pleasing,
        soft, pliant, smooth, tractable, gentle, mild, meeke, lovelie, kind,
        courteous, loving.”<a href="#fn22"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref22"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a> As noted above, these meanings
        seem to align more closely with the quality of fatty than with that of
        sour/brittle.</p>
    <p>A closer reading of other instances of <em>aigre</em> in the manuscript
        reveals, however, that the author-practitioner contrasts it with
        <em>doulx</em> in describing fusibility (how easily a metal is melted).
        On fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/32v/f/32v/tl"><u>32v</u></a>,
        he contrasts <em>aigre</em> and <em>doulx</em> metals, explaining that
        sour metals are easily melted, while sweet/soft metals are more
        difficult to found:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>They [founders] buy rosette at xx lb a quintal, which is harder to
            melt than latten because it is softer [<em>doulce</em>]. For, the
            softer [<em>doulx</em>] the <sup>great</sup> metals are, the <del>
                soft</del> more difficult they are to melt. The tin for bells,
            which is fine tin <del>is more</del> and which is brittle [aigre],
            is easier to melt than lead, which is soft [<em>doulx</em>]. Latten
            made brittle [<em>aigry</em>] by the calamine is melted more quickly
            than red copper. The <em>metal</em> [a copper-tin alloy] which is
            the substance of bells, mixed with tin, and very brittle
            [<em>aigre</em>], is soon melted. The more silver is alloyed, the
            sooner it melts, that is why solder is made with it.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>We would explain this by saying that the
        melting point of tin is lower than lead,<a href="#fn23"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref23"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a> but for the author-practitioner
        the determining factors are the sourness/brittleness of tin and the
        soft, fatty qualities of lead.</p>
    <p>The author-practitioner also refers to sugar as easily melted. As noted
        above, in a recipe for coloring fruit cast from sugar on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/31r/f/31r/tl"><u>31r</u></a>,
        he cautions, “one does not paint them with a paintbrush like other <em>
            <del>s</del>
        </em> things with moistened color, because the sugar would melt. But one
        rubs them with color with the finger.” His advice refers to the sugar
        after it has been cast, that is, after it has undergone its change of
        state from fatty to dry and brittle, and, in this entry, easily melted.
        This helps to clarify the author-practitioner’s reasoning: when sugar is
        fatty and liquid, it is sticky, but when it changes state by drying
        (crystallizing), it becomes sour, brittle, and easy to melt.</p>
    <h3 id="the-properties-of-sugar-in-medicine">The Properties of Sugar in
        Medicine</h3>
    <p>These multiple properties of sugar are further illuminated by examining
        medicinal theories deriving from the medieval Islamic tradition.<a

           id="fnref24"

        Islamic text by Ibn al-Nafis, a physician considered the first to
        describe the pulmonary circulation of the blood. Born in 1213 in
        Damascus, al-Nafis wrote an encyclopedia titled <em>Al-Shamil fi
            al-Tibb,</em> in which he describes the medicinal effects of sugar
        on various pulmonary disorders. In the fourth section, describing
        sugar’s effects on the organs in the chest, he writes, “sugar has atoms
        with a ‘gentle’ quality, and as it dissolves easily in liquids, it moves
        easily into the organs of the chest and is highly effective on them.”<a

        changing qualities. He explains the different qualities of sugar as
        pertaining to their elements—one atom of sugar is composed of elements
        of water, gentle hot earth, and air. These elements interact during the
        hardening of boiled sugar: “when the water element’s properties arise,
        but there is little water present, the properties of the air element
        overtake those of the water element. When boiled, sugar congeals, its
        water element properties naturally recede.”<a href="#fn27"

    <p>This account from the realm of medicine describing the multiple
        properties of sugar shows that the author-practitioner’s statements
        about sugar being fatty, sour, and brittle are not without meaning. His
        description of sugar expresses a material imaginary in which materials
        are classified along a spectrum from fat to lean and sweet to sour. The
        author-practitioner saw sugar as simultaneously possessing multiple
        properties that emerged and receded as sugar changed state through
        processes of boiling and hardening.</p>
    <h2 id="sattaquer-and-material-agency"><em>S’attaquer</em> and Material
        Agency</h2>
    <p>The term the author-practitioner uses for the process of sugar sticking
        (or recrystallizing) is <em>s’attaquer</em>. This is interesting because
        the author-practitioner also uses <em>attaquer</em> to mean “attack,” as
        in the attack of a snake. <em>Attaquer</em> is defined by Cotgrave as
        “to assault, or set on; to incounter...any way to meddle with.”<a

        or attach, only becoming differentiated in the course of the century.<a

        almost instantaneous, change of state from a liquid to a crystallized
        mass was so dramatic and irreversible that this aggressive term
        <em>s’attaque</em> (both attachment and attack) did not seem out of
        place to describe the phenomenon. The sugar seemed to be acting of its
        own volition.</p>
    <p>To better understand this conception of materials as active, we can look
        to the author-practitioner’s contemporary, Bernard Palissy (ca. 1510–ca.
        1589). In the <em>Admirable Discourses</em> (1580), Palissy includes a
        “Treatise on Metals and Alchemy,” in which he presents a dialogue
        between the characters “Theory” and “Practice.” In this dialogue
        Practice disproves Theory’s claim that “metals are dead and insensible
        bodies.”<a href="#fn32"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref32"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a> Practice tells Theory a
        “secret”—that all metals were created with the same life force as
        plants:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Just as I have told you that the seeds or matters of all vegetative
            things were created at the very beginning of the world along with
            the earth: also I have told you that all mineral matters (which you
            call inert bodies) were also created like the vegetative ones, and
            exert themselves to produce seeds to generate others. Also, the
            mineral ones are not so inert that they do not generate and produce
            from one degree to another, more excellent things, and to make you
            understand it better, the mineral substances are intermixed and
            hidden among the waters, in the womb of the earth, just as every
            human and brute creature is conceived as water in its formation: and
            being intermixed among the waters, there is some supreme substance
            which attracts others of its nature to form itself.<a href="#fn33"
               class="footnote-ref"
               id="fnref33"
               role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>Practice sees minerals as imbued with
        agency and a drive to reproduce, comparable to humans, brute creatures,
        and plants. This agency manifests in the attraction of like substances.
        Practice describes this force of attraction found after grinding a rock
        of fusible matter:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>After having thus pulverized [the rock], I mixed it with clay, and a
            few days later when I wished to work with this clay, I found that
            the rock had begun to gather together, even though it was so
            thoroughly mixed with the clay that no one could have found a piece
            of it as large as the little motes that are seen in the sun’s rays
            when they come in to a room . . . that must make you believe that
            the materials of metals gather together and congeal admirably,
            according to the admirable order and power that God has ordained for
            them.<a href="#fn34"
               class="footnote-ref"
               id="fnref34"
               role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>Practice personifies the fusible rock as a
        material with its own agency, attracted to things of like form, and able
        to find those things and combine with them. In Palissy’s dialogue,
        Practice disproves the theory of metals as dead substances. The agency
        of materials emerges through practice, and the attraction of like
        minerals to form larger structures indicates a much larger purpose and
        life force imbued in natural materials.</p>
    <p>The author-practitioner often describes materials as “demanding,”
        “wanting,” “desiring,” and “refusing,” but in the specific instance of
        sugar, perhaps Palissy’s attribution of changes in state to the action
        of elements at war is relevant: “fire is the destroyer of water, and
        wherever it enters it must expel the water, or if it does not, the water
        will kill it.”<a href="#fn35"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref35"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>35</sup></a> The dual nature of sugar—fat
        when liquid, and sour when dry—and its apparently willful actions, seem
        to align with this kind of violent material agency that causes sudden
        and significant changes of state.<a href="#fn36"

    <h2 id="affordances-and-constraints-of-the-material">Affordances and
        Constraints of the Material</h2>
    <p>Recently, material agency has been described not as a life force, but,
        instead, within a framework of affordances and constraints. For example,
        Anne-Sophie Lehmann describes it as “the restriction or encouragement of
        certain actions that result from the specific properties of the
        material.”<a href="#fn37"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref37"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>37</sup></a> She points out that, in the act
        of making, action “is not simply exerted by the actor on the
        material,”<a href="#fn38"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref38"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>38</sup></a> but moves reciprocally back and
        forth between the two. We can see this, for example, in the
        author-practitioner’s observations about the properties of sugar which
        necessitate certain actions on the part of the practitioner enacting the
        process to transform sugar from one state to the next. Sugar is fatty,
        thus good for round things, but also brittle, hence the need to coat
        bunches of grapes with wax. In the same way, the sudden <em>attaque</em>
        of recrystallization by the sugar needed an immediate reaction from the
        practitioner—that of throwing starch into the mold.</p>
    <p>As we performed and reflected on our actions in reconstructing the
        recipe, we came to see how, within the space of the recipe, the
        author-practitioner’s listing of the properties of sugar alongside
        instructions for actions constituted a description of this push and pull
        of reciprocal action between materials and maker. We also came to
        recognize that in our own reconstruction, the final product of sugar
        casts resulted from our interaction with materials that by no means
        passively accepted our efforts to transform them.</p>

                <p>The price of sugar in England in 1582–93 was between 17.10

                    1583, 1 pound of sugar would trade for almost 15 grams of
                    silver. In 1500 in Madeira (the world’s largest sugar
                    exporter at the time), 100 lbs of sugar was worth one ounce
                    of gold. Today, two tons of sugar is worth one ounce of
                    gold, making sugar forty–five times cheaper now than in
                    1500, see the Natural History Museum, London on sugar,

                    in England as alphenics, or more commonly as penidia,
                    penids, pennet or pan sugar. They were the precursors of
                    barley sugar and our modern cough sweets. In 1390, the Earl
                    of Derby paid ‘two shillings for two pounds of penydes.’ A
                    medicinal confect called diapenidion, in which penids were
                    ground to a powder with pine nuts, almonds, cinnamon,
