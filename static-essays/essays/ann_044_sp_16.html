        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <div>
            <p>Oil of sulfur, composed primarily of sulfuric acid, is a
                corrosive mineral acid with many applications. In Ms. Fr. 640,
                however, the material is almost exclusively mentioned on a
                single folio (fol. <a
                   href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/46r/f/46r/tl"><u>46r</u></a>–<a
                   href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/46v/f/46v/tl"><u>v</u></a>)
                in a series of recipes possibly copied from a source referred to
                as “Urb.” This essay studies and recreates a selection of these
                recipes, focusing on those in which oil of sulfur is used as a
                material for a scribe—as an invisible ink, in creating openwork
                in paper, as a cleaning agent for quills, and for removing ink
                from parchment. While numerous contemporary books of secrets
                include recipes for invisible inks and ink removal, often
                requiring acids like citrus juice, no other known sources
                specifically use oil of sulfur for these purposes. This novel
                application of oil of sulfur serves as a valuable case study of
                the use of mineral acids in early modern craft processes, as
                well as early modern techniques for invisible ink and erasure.

        and three on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/46r/f/46r/tl"><u>46r</u></a>,
        outline uses of “oil of sulfur,” a material predominantly composed of
        what is now known as sulfuric acid.<a href="#fn1"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref1"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> Aside from the ten oil of sulfur
        recipes on this folio, only one other entry in the manuscript mentions
        the material.<a href="#fn2"

           id="fnref2"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> Of these recipes, the four on
        which this essay focuses (all from fol. 46v) deal with oil of sulfur as
        a tool of the scribe, describing its applications as an invisible ink
        (“Writing without ink”), in creating openwork in paper (“Making a letter
        <em>à jour</em> on paper and other work”), as a cleaning agent for
        writing quills (“Scribe, Oil of sulfur”), and for removing ink from
        parchment (“Erasing a letter”).<a href="#fn3"

           id="fnref3"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> While sulfuric acid is frequently
        mentioned in early modern recipe books and medical treatises,<a
           href="#fn4"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref4"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> there is scant literature on the
        use of sulfuric acid in writing processes. These recipes therefore offer
        insight into sixteenth-century writing techniques, as well as the
        specific methods with which the author-practitioner was familiar and
        which he may have used in the creation of Ms. Fr. 640. Many questions
        are raised by the fol. 46v recipes: why would they have been included in
        a compendium such as Ms. Fr. 640, and how do they relate to other
        recipes in the manuscript? Is the use of sulfuric acid as a scribe’s
        tool described in other books of secrets or writing treatises? Could the
        Ms. Fr. 640 recipes have been copied from another source, and if so,
        what do they tell us about how the author-practitioner compiled Ms. Fr.
        640? The fol. 46v recipes contain meaningful clues, which facilitate a
        greater understanding of the author-practitioner’s working methods, the
        use of mineral acids in early modern craft processes, and early modern
        techniques for invisible ink and erasure.</p>
    <p>While there are multiple ways of contextualizing the fol. 46v recipes
        within the manuscript, I chose to compare them to other recipes in Ms.
        Fr. 640 that use similar materials or that lay out techniques of scribes
        and illuminators. Numerous recipes in Ms. Fr. 640 address working on
        paper and parchment, including recipes that focus on technique and
        optical effects (e.g., “Mathematical figures without a ruler or
        compass,” fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/19v/f/19v/tl"><u>19v</u></a>;
        “Painting large figures,” fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/65v/f/65v/tl"><u>65v</u></a>),
        and recipes that describe illumination processes such as gilding
        parchment (e.g. “Seat for gold leaf on parchment or paper,” fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/10v/f/10v/tl"><u>10v</u></a>;
        “Lettering of gold on paper,” fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/8r/f/8r/tl"><u>8r</u></a>;
        “Layer of burnished gold on paper,” fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/29v/f/29v/tl"><u>29v</u></a>).
        However, these recipes are widely dispersed throughout the manuscript,
        making connections between the recipes on fol. 46v and these other
        applications on paper and parchment tenuous.</p>
    <p>The immediate context of the recipes on fol. 46r–v is of interest given
        that it is the only folio in the manuscript to include oil of sulfur
        (aside from a note much later in the manuscript). Compared to other
        sections of the manuscript, the writing on this folio is very clear,
        with no marginal notes or visible corrections, which might suggest that
        the author-practitioner copied the recipes from another source rather
        than recording them from observations of a practitioner or from personal
        experiments. Further, the author-practitioner writes “Urb” toward the
        end of all but one of the recipes on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/46v/f/46v/tl"><u>46v</u></a>,<a
           href="#fn5"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref5"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> raising the possibility that
        “Urb” is an abbreviation for a source from which this group of recipes
        is drawn. Indeed, “Comment. urb. rom.” is mentioned on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/1r/f/1r/tl"><u>1r</u></a>
        among a list of authors.<a href="#fn6"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref6"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> Whatever the meaning of “Urb,” it
        does not appear anywhere else in the manuscript. If “Urb” is a source,
        it could provide a valuable piece of information about the transmission
        of knowledge in Ms. Fr. 640 and about the working practices of the
        author-practitioner; as yet, however, the identification of “Urb”
        remains obscure, and requires further investigation. The fact that the
        fol. 46v recipes are composed neatly on a single page and use a material
        that is only mentioned once otherwise in Ms. Fr. 640 reinforces the idea
        that the author-practitioner drew them from another source.</p>
    <p>Though the largest group of the oil of sulfur recipes on fol. 46r–v are
        relevant to the scribe, the others include forays into medicine,
        cosmetic treatments, cobblery, and practical jokes. This essay focuses
        on four writing recipes from fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/46v/f/46v/tl"><u>46v</u></a>,
        but it is worth noting that two more recipes on that page also address
        writing or drawing with oil of sulfur. A recipe titled, “Shoemaker”
        (“Cordonnier”), for example, describes decorating leather shoes with a
        “writing quill” dipped in oil of sulfur:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>If he wants to do some tanned work on black leather shoes, he can dip
            in oil of sulfur a writing quill and paint with it what he would
            like on shoes, boots, and <em>colets</em>. And he will obtain a
            reddish color which no effort will erase. Urb.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>While this recipe uses leather footwear as
        its object rather than paper or parchment, the process of using oil of
        sulfur and a quill to create text or designs remains the same, and
        presumably parchment and leather might react similarly to the acid.<a
           href="#fn7"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref7"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> Another recipe describes creating
        “Black letters on stone,” by writing on stone with oil of sulfur and
        then heating until the text “becomes black and penetrates.”</p>
    <p>In contrast, the remaining four oil of sulfur recipes on fol. 46r–v are
        more disparate, reflecting a grouping of recipes by material rather than
        effect. The recipes on fol. 46r address treatments for bodily ailments
        or imperfections: “For the teeth, oil of sulfur” uses oil of sulfur as a
        tooth whitener;<a href="#fn8"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref8"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> “Against the falling sickness” is
        a medical treatment for epilepsy or seizures;<a href="#fn9"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref9"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> and “Against cold gouts” is a
        medical treatment for gout. The least similar recipe among the oil of
        sulfur recipes is “Making someone’s boots burn” on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/46v/f/46v/tl"><u>46v</u></a>,
        which promises that if you, “Rub with the aforesaid oil, &amp; as it
        becomes warm, they will burn without a flame. Urb.” Significantly, after
        46v, the author-practitioner returns to medical recipes on fol. 47r,
        including different treatments for tooth-whitening and “epilepsy or
        dizziness.” The fact that the author-practitioner deviates course on
        fol. 46v only to return to medical recipes on fol. 47r might suggest
        that he encountered these applications of oil of sulfur while writing
        the fol. 46r recipes, and recorded them on fol. 46v before returning to
        his original topic.</p>
    <p>While oil of sulfur is almost entirely restricted to fol. 46, its single
        other occurrence in Ms. Fr. 640 is on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/117v/f/117v/tl"><u>117v</u></a>,
        where it is mentioned in a note on a metalcasting recipe. This
        application falls in line with the author-practitioner’s use of other
        mineral acids, which he discusses making and using throughout Ms. Fr.
        640, most notably <em>aquafortis.</em> These acids are used in Ms. Fr.
        640 almost exclusively for metalworking. The use of oil of sulfur for
        writing and erasing could therefore be considered atypical for the use
        of mineral acids in Ms. Fr. 640. However, since the
        author-practitioner’s other applications of mineral acids rely on their
        reactivity with metal, it may be useful to consider the fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/46v/f/46v/tl"><u>46v</u></a>
        recipes “Erasing a letter” and “Scribe, Oil of sulfur” as relying on a
        similar chemical process, since the iron sulfates in iron gall ink cause
        its reaction with sulfuric acid. While this would not explain the use of
        oil of sulfur in the other fol. 46 recipes, it nonetheless raises a
        question about the author-practitioner’s understanding of the properties
        of and relationships between materials.</p>
    <p>In any case, the fol. 46r–v recipes are thus unusual for several reasons:
        they represent almost the only mention of oil of sulfur in Ms. Fr. 640,
        perhaps suggesting that oil of sulfur was not a material with which the
        author-practitioner was familiar or to which he had access; they contain
        what appears to be a citation of an outside source, “Urb,” that is
        otherwise unmentioned in Ms. Fr. 640; they represent a grouping of
        recipes by material rather than effect; they are cleanly written. The
        evidence that these recipes are copied from elsewhere, combined with the
        fact that the author-practitioner only mentions oil of sulfur once
        elsewhere in Ms. Fr. 640, suggests that the author-practitioner probably
        did not attempt the recipes himself. Yet if the author-practitioner did
        not attempt the fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/46v/f/46v/tl"><u>46v</u></a>
        recipes, was it because of lack of opportunity or lack of interest? Did
        the author-practitioner include these recipes because invisible ink and
        ink erasure recipes were common in books of secrets? Further, were they
        considered to be practical applications for the scribe, or should they
        be categorized more as novelties or illusions?</p>
    <h2 id="recipes">Recipes </h2>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>The oil of sulfur recipes concerning
        writing describe two opposite effects: making black letters from
        invisible ink and making black ink invisible. “Writing without ink” uses
        oil of sulfur to write on paper with a quill; though the letters are
        initially invisible, they emerge “black as this one” (i.e., as black as
        the author-practitioner’s ink was at the time he was writing)<a
           href="#fn10"

        heat of a flame. This recipe fits into a long tradition of invisible

           id="fnref11"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> which would have been useful for
        passing secret messages, whether as a novelty trick among friends and
        lovers or for transmitting more clandestine correspondences. Many books
        of secrets contain recipes of this kind, demonstrating their popularity
        and ubiquity. Giambattista della Porta’s 1558 <em>Natural Magick</em>,
        for example, contains several recipes about “inks” that require heat to
        become visible (e.g., “Letters th-- cannot be read unless the paper be
        burnt,” “Write letters -- of fire”), including one that uses the acid of
        citrus juice, “To make letters visible by fire.”<a href="#fn12"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref12"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> Another recipe in which heat
        produces the appearance of ink can be seen in a 1628 <em>Book of Pretty
            Conceits,</em><a href="#fn13"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref13"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> in a recipe titled, “To write a
        letter with such Inke as cannot be perceiued, vnlesse it be holden
        before the fire:”</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Take a sheet of fair white paper, and write thereon with the iuice of

    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>Various other methods for transmitting
        secret messages also appear in recipe books. For example, William
        Phillip’s 1596 <em>Book of Secrets,</em><a href="#fn15"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref15"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> itself translated from earlier
        sources, includes a recipe, “To write without ink, that it may not be
        seen, vnlesse the paper be wet with water.” Phillip’s recipe describes
        writing on paper with an “ink” made of vitriol and water, and
        subsequently revealing the writing by immersing the paper in a solution
        of water and gall powder, producing the same chemical reaction that
        turns iron gall ink black:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Take pouder of victriall, and put it into a cleane inkehorne, put a
            little cleane water to it, when the victriall is dissolued, write
            with it either vpon paper or parchment, and let it drie, and it
            cannot bee read: when you will read it, take halfe a pint of water,
            and put thereto an ounce of pouder of gaules, mix them well
            together, then straine them through a linnen cloath into a cleane
            pot, then draw the paper through the water, and the writing will be
            clacke, as if it had ben written with inke.<a href="#fn16"

               id="fnref16"
               role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>This technique is also described in John
        Bate’s 1634 <em>The mysteryes of nature.</em><a href="#fn17"

    <p>“Making a letter <em>à jour</em> on paper and other work” reiterates the
        “writing without ink” recipe with one additional step: abrading the
        blackened letters with a “sponge,” which causes the weakened areas of
        the paper to fall out and produce openwork letters. The phrase “<em>à

    <p>Although this technique on paper does not appear in other sources, the
        intentional use of sulfuric acid to corrode or weaken paper does appear
        in other recipes, as in a recipe in <em>Natural Magick</em> titled “How
        letters are made, that eat the paper,” in which sulfuric acid is added
        into ink. However, though the effect outlined is similar, the intent of
        della Porta’s recipe seems markedly different than that of the <em>à
            jour</em> letters:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>in few days by corroding the paper, or the ink it self, the letters
            will vanish, or in a moneth, as you put in more or less of the oyl;
            and this you may try before you send away your letter: If you would
            have it work more slowly, add but a little oyl; if faster, put in
            more: you may, when it is too strong, put some water to it.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>In other words, della Porta’s recipe is
        not used to create a decorative effect, but rather to create a message
        that will self-destruct within a specified and predictable timeframe.

        ink.<a href="#fn21"

        sulfur. Methods for ink erasure are found in numerous books of secrets,
        and frequently utilize acids. <em>Natural Magick</em> includes a recipe
        titled “Take letters off the paper” which, though it does not use oil of
        sulfur, features another acid often derived from vitriol,
        <em>aquafortis</em>. Significantly, della Porta specifies that this

        further be traced to medieval sources, including a chapter in the

        other acids including “acid of the citron” are suggested as effective

        been translated into European languages, but the fact that these
        techniques were described in the eleventh century demonstrates a long
        history and suggests that they may have circulated in Eurasia prior to
        being recorded in recipe books.</p>
    <p>A variety of ink removal recipes are discussed in books of secrets and
        writing treatises, including two in William Phillip’s <em>Book of
            Secrets</em>, “To take inke out of paper or parchment:”</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Take <em>Colofoniam,</em> which is called <em>pix graecum,</em> beat
            it small, and cast it on the paper that is written, then wet a
            cloath, and lay it on the <em>Colofoniam,</em> vpon the cloath lay
            some fresh horse dung, &amp; vpon that set a smooth tile stone, then
            if it be in winter let it stand a whole night, but if it bee summer,
            let it stand but from mor|ning till nine of the clocke.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>This recipe is directly followed by
        another method, “Otherwise”:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Take <em>Salarmoniacke,</em> and alum, still it in a</p>
        <p>limbeck, and with this water wet the writing and it will goe out.<a

    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>These contemporary examples demonstrate
        the widespread and varied nature of invisible ink and ink removal

        recipes. Despite the prevalence of these recipes in early modern
        sources, however, I have found no contemporary recipes using sulfuric
        acid used in the ways described on fol. 46v, perhaps indicating that
        these applications were uncommon, or that alternate ingredients achieved
        better results or were more widely available.</p>

        expected in an era before standardized materials, it is important to
        note because the results of recipe reconstructions may have been
        affected by such variables. In the case of ink, while there are two
        recipes for printers’ ink in Ms. Fr. 640, there are no recipes for
        writing ink.<a href="#fn27"

        considerably from iron gall ink, the preferred writing ink during this
        period and the type used in creating Ms. Fr. 640. Additionally, I
        hypothesized that it would be necessary to use iron gall ink to produce
        the chemical reactions found in the fol. 46v recipes.<a href="#fn28"

           id="fnref29"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a> for a standard early modern
        heated iron gall ink. I also used two other historically-appropriate
        inks, a cold-prepared iron gall ink from the 2015 Columbia University
        French Paleography workshop (to test the variability of a different
        preparation of iron gall ink), and a carbon ink from the Ancient Ink
        Laboratory.<a href="#fn30"

        iron sulfate in iron gall ink would react with the sulfuric acid whereas
        carbon ink would be unreactive, allowing for a control group.
        Additionally, I used 50-50 hemp and cotton paper with gelatin sizing,
        and both goat and calf parchment.<a href="#fn31"

    <p>Safety considerations compelled me to be very precise when dealing with
        sulfuric acid. I began the reconstructions with a 15 percent, 3 Molar
        sulfuric acid solution. This low concentration solution was effective in
        two of the four recipes attempted, those for “Writing without ink” and
        “Making a letter <em>à jour</em> on paper and other work,” which are
        closely related. Both of these recipes include writing on paper with oil
        of sulfur and heating the paper until the letters appear black; “Making
        a letter <em>à jour</em> on paper and other work” extends this recipe
        one step further by using a “sponge” to gently abrade the surface of the
        paper until the blackened letters fall out, creating openwork letters.
    </p>
    <p>I established proof of concept for these recipes by drawing circles on
        paper with the sulfuric acid solution, which only revealed themselves
        when held over a hot plate with tongs (<i><u>Fig. 2</u></i>). I also
        tested the recipe on goat and calf parchments, which did not react (<i><u>Fig. 3</u></i>). Furthermore, parchment curled and warped quickly
        at low temperatures, which suggested that not only is paper necessary
        for the desired chemical reaction with cellulose, but also because
        parchment is destroyed at low heat whereas paper tolerates heat well. To
        produce the <em>à jour</em> effect, I abraded the surface of the paper
        with a makeshift brush until the blackened circles fell out of the paper
        (<i><u>Fig. 4</u></i>). Since these techniques were effective while the
        other two were not, it is possible that the “writing without ink” and
        “Making a letter <em>à jour</em> on paper and other work” recipes
        required a less intense concentration of sulfuric acid to begin with, or
        that the process of heating the sulfuric acid in these experiments
        concentrated the sulfuric acid as water evaporated, producing a more
        effective result.</p>

    <p>The other two recipes, “Scribe, Oil of sulfur” or “Erasing a letter,” did
        not produce the effect that the author-practitioner describes when
        attempted with the 15% sulfuric acid solution.<a href="#fn32"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref32"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a> The diluted sulfuric acid
        solution was not noticeably more effective for removing ink from paper,
        parchment, or quill than water, the control in these experiments (<i><u>Fig. 5</u></i>). I therefore attempted these reconstructions a
        second time with a higher concentration of sulfuric acid, using a 96% 18
        Molar sulfuric acid.<a href="#fn33"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref33"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a> Repeating the “Scribe, Oil of
        sulfur” and “Erasing a letter” experiments with the high concentration
        sulfuric acid proved much more effective. In “Scribe, Oil of sulfur,”
        the quill became very clean (<i><u>Fig. 6</u></i>), while the control
        quill cleaned in water remained black. I was surprised, however, that
        the “Erasing a letter” experiment was not more effective; since the
        concentration of the sulfuric acid was very high, I assumed that the
        acid would immediately react and remove the ink completely. The sulfuric
        acid did react with the iron gall inks in a way that it did not with the
        carbon ink, and was much more effective than the water control; however,
        the letters did not disappear upon contact. While the letters lightened
        and became a reddish color over several minutes, they did not fully
        disappear (<i><u>Fig. 7</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 8</u></i>). This experiment
        was most effective in the middle of a letter where the natural curvature
        of the parchment allowed the acid to pool a bit. Even in this case,
        however, the ink was not immediately removed. Based on these
        observations, sulfuric acid certainly aids in the removal of ink from
        paper and parchment, but it did not result in a totally clean surface.
        It is, of course, also possible that the author-practitioner omitted
        further steps or treatments that would have more fully removed ink
        traces.</p>

    <p>The reconstructions demonstrated that the applications of oil of sulfur
        as a scribe’s tool are viable at a low concentration for “writing
        without ink” and “Making a letter <em>à jour</em> on paper and other
        work,” and with concentrated sulfuric acid for “Scribe, Oil of sulfur”
        and “Erasing a letter.” Assuming that the sixteenth-century workshop
        would have had access to a concentrated solution,<a href="#fn35"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref35"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>35</sup></a> the reconstructions verified
        that oil of sulfur could have been an effective addition to the scribe’s
        tool kit. However, the degradation that it causes, at least in
        parchment, also limits its applicability. While many contemporary
        recipes describe intended effects similar to those in the fol. 46v
        recipes, I have found none that specifically use sulfuric acid,
        suggesting that if these applications of sulfuric acid were used, their
        scope may have been limited. Perhaps the corrosive properties of
        sulfuric acid prohibited its widespread use as a scribe’s tool,
        especially given that a variety of materials were said to achieve the
        same effects.</p>

                    historically known as “oil of vitriol” or “oil of sulfur”
                    (“huile de soufre” in French). The term “oil of vitriol”
                    refers to the production of sulfuric acid through the
                    heating of vitriol, or iron sulfate, the same ingredient
                    used in iron gall inks; this connection between the
                    composition of iron gall ink and oil of sulfur allowed for a
                    chemical reaction that the author-practitioner showcases in
                    these recipes. For a history of vitriol use and production,
                    see Vladimir Karpenko and John A. Norris. “Vitriol in the
                    History of Chemistry,” <em>Chemické Listy</em> 96 (2002):

                    in reference to a casting recipe: “The asparagus stalk is so
                    hard that most often it perseveres as charcoal. Because of
                    this, do it rather dried out or wet it with sulfur oil &amp;
                    that of turpentine, or indeed cast the little branches
                    separately &amp; solder them onto a fat stalk drawn through
                    with a wire.” There are, however, numerous instances of
                    related words and materials, including “sulfur,” (41
                    instances) “vitriol,” (6 instances) “aquafortis” (“<em>eau
                        fort</em>”) (26 instances) and “copperas,” (9
                    instances). I was interested in the use of the terms
                    “vitriol” and “copperas” because sulfuric acid was also
                    called “oil of vitriol” in the early modern period since it
                    could be produced through heating vitriol (iron sulfate),
                    and copperas is a specific type of iron sulfate (also known
                    as “green vitriol”). Aquafortis is another strong corrosive
                    acid, also used frequently in metalworking as well as
                    medical and cosmetic applications, and also sometimes
                    derived from vitriol. On aquafortis, see Michael Assis, "To

                    use ‘sharpening agents’ to speed up the unhairing process.
                    So the skins are probably all treated early on with sodium
                    sulphide or something similar rather than simply lime and
                    additives like dung and vegetable liquors. Many modern

                <p>It is also possible that other treatments of the paper and

                    not only to the treatments to the paper and parchment before
                    they reached the lab, but also the way that the
                    reconstructions were executed. For example, before storing
                    the reconstructions, excess sulfuric acid was blotted off
                    the parchment and paper, but no other steps were taken to
                    clean the paper or parchment. Washing or treating the

                <p>Early modern methods for making sulfuric acid were capable of
                    producing concentrated solutions. Methods of making “oyl of
