        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <div>
            <p>Three entries in Ms. Fr. 640—on fols. <a
                   href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/129r/f/129r/tl"><u>129r</u></a>,

                   href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/155r/f/155r/tl"><u>155r</u></a>,
                <a
                   href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/155v/f/155v/tl"><u>155v</u></a>—are
                devoted exclusively to molding and casting roses. This essay
                clarifies some of the differences between the recipes, and
                suggests a potential change recorded by the author-practitioner
                that may have resulted from repeated experiments with the
                techniques over time. This set of entries are related to the
                molding and casting of other “thin things,” such as flies'
                wings, another thin, delicate substance that, like rose petals,
                necessitated separate castings. This essay proposes that the
                motives for singling out roses as an object to be molded are
                likely related to sixteenth-century literary culture in France,
                perhaps especially in Toulouse, where a literary society known
                in the sixteenth century as the College de l’Art et Science de
                Rhétorique awarded cast flowers as prizes for an annual poetry
                contest, the Jeux Floraux, which originated in the city in the
                fourteenth century.</p>

    <p>At least nine entries in BnF Ms. Fr. 640 pertain specifically to the
        process of casting flowers and plants.<a href="#fn1"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref1"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> Among these, three are devoted
        exclusively to the steps taken to cast a rose. This technique is a
        contemporary practice of making “life casts” of flowers, and there are
        clear precedents in the artistic production of Bernard Palissy and
        Wenzel Jamnitzer. As this essay will show, the motives for singling out
        roses to be molded is likely related to the literary production of
        sixteenth-century France. In particular, the casting of flowers suggests
        a connection between the manuscript author and a literary society in
        Toulouse known in the sixteenth century as the College de l’Art et
        Science de Rhétorique. This society awarded cast metal flowers as prizes
        for an annual poetry contest known as the Jeux Floraux, which originated
        in the city in the fourteenth century. The manuscript
        author-practitioner could possibly have had ties to the College, as a
        number of poems presented there in the sixteenth and seventeenth
        centuries include references to alchemy and other natural subjects.</p>
    <p>The lengthiest entry in Ms. Fr. 640 on the molding of roses appears on
        fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/155r/f/155r/tl"><u>155r</u></a>.
        The entry calls for the different parts of the rose to be cast
        separately: the branches, rosebud and the stem, advice not given
        elsewhere in the manuscript in regard to other cast flowers (such as a
        marigold).<a href="#fn2"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref2"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> The author notes the possibility
        of molding the rose petals together by separating them with thread,
        indicating the particular care devoted to ensuring a detailed cast of
        the petals without allowing them to be crushed. To help strengthen the
        rose, the author calls for coating the outer petals with butter. An
        earlier entry on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/129r/f/129r/tl"><u>129r</u></a>,
        “Molded Roses,” explicitly calls for the use of wheat oil to help
        stiffen rose petals (<em>les feuilles</em>).<a href="#fn3"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref3"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> Evidently in the course of
        writing the manuscript, the author-practitioner discovered a problem
        with this technique, or simply changed his mind. In “Reinforcing flowers
        and delicate things” on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/154v/f/154v/tl"><u>154v</u></a>,
        the author explains that wheat oil should <em>not</em> be used to
        strengthen flowers, but rather that melted butter should coat the
        <em>backs</em> of flower petals (as in the case of roses and pansies).
        This difference may offer a clue to the temporally linear process of the
        manuscript’s composition, as this example signals a clear difference in
        the processes used at a later point in the manuscript. The author may be
        self-correcting.</p>
    <p>To help metal flow between the leaves, the author notes later in the
        entry on fol. 155r that they should be joined “leaf to leaf” with “small
        veins of wax,” or sprues. The word “<em>foeuille</em>” refers to leaves
        here because the sketch in the left margin illustrates the larger
        spruing system in place that would have connected the rose leaves to one
        another and to the rose buds, which are surprisingly <em>not</em> shown
        detached from the stem (<i><u>Fig. 1</u></i>). It may be that this
        illustration accounts for a marginal note further below, which states
        that one can mold the rosebud near a piece of its stem, which is to be
        connected later to a separate “tinned latten” stem.</p>

    <p>The latter half of the entry is largely given over to the process of
        cleaning the mold of ashes after the rose has been burned out and the
        wax infrastructure melted out, before the metal is cast into the mold.
        The author-practitioner’s comment that “this is the easiest way, but you
        can also do the other,” may have signaled to the reader to return to the
        entry on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/117v/f/117v/tl"><u>117v</u></a>,
        “For making the ashes of flowers and plants leave molds.” As flowers and
        other objects burned in molds could leave ashes and charcoal in the
        mold, this step was necessary.</p>
    <p>The rose produced by the process on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/155r/f/155r/tl"><u>155r</u></a>
        was meant to be altered further, as other entries in the manuscript
        reveal. The entry “Rose” on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/155v/f/155v/tl"><u>155v</u></a>
        is a clear rejoinder to the preceding one as it contains instructions
        without which the rose molding on fol. 155r would have been incomplete.
        It begins by stating that because of the billowy nature of the rose
        bloom and the various arrangements of its petals, “it does not appear
        beautiful if it is not painted.” For emphasis, this fact is stated again
        later in the same entry. While the author does not explicitly describe
        the process for painting the rose here, the manuscript contains
        instructions for painting metal casts of other flowers (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/158v/f/158v/tl"><u>158v</u></a>)
        and of a crayfish (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/141v/f/141v/tl"><u>141v</u></a>).
        Fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/116r/f/116r/tl"><u>116r</u></a>
        of the manuscript also contains an entry for enameling fine leaves of a
        rose cast in gold (although the entry on fol. 155v speaks specifically
        of making the rose in tin and lead—not gold. The entry on fol. 155v also
        offers suggestions for how to correct imperfections in the cast, as well
        as how to glue or pin various pieces back together. Painting may not
        have been the only means of further amending the cast rose. On the next
        folio in the manuscript, <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/156v/f/156v/tl"><u>156v</u></a>,
        the author gives instructions for molding a fly, which he affixes to a
        bouquet of sage. The proximity of this entry to that on fol. 155r is
        significant, as the process of molding the delicate rose petals seems
        linked to the molding of the fly’s wings, which are thin, necessitate
        separate casting, and are later soldered back onto the body of the
        fly.<a href="#fn4"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref4"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
    <p>Equally significant to what is contained in the rose entries is what is
        left out: detailed discussion of the actual process of casting. Only in
        the margin of fol. 155r does the author add that the rose should be
        wetted with eau-de-vie to ensure a clean cast. One should understand the
        entry on fol. 155r as an elaboration on a process that had been more
        fully described elsewhere in the manuscript. For example, fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/117r/f/117r/tl"><u>117r</u></a>
        contains the entry “A means of molding flowers and plants,” which
        outlines how to arrange a flower or plant on the clay slab in order to
        keep the flower from being crushed by the plaster, or floating up as the
        wet plaster is poured into the clay form that holds the plant. This
        information is not included in the entry on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/155r/f/155r/tl"><u>155r</u></a>.
    </p>
    <p>Surviving sixteenth-century objects made through the processes of life
        molding and casting exist from the workshops of Bernard Palissy and
        Wenzel Jamnitzer.<a href="#fn5"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref5"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> The bouquet of flowers atop
        Jamnitzer’s table ornament of 1549 (Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam) reflects one
        potential arrangement of such objects in a particularly masterful object
        (<i><u>Fig.2</u></i>). Separately cast plants of exceptional
        delicacy attributed to Jamnitzer also survive (<i><u>Fig. 3</u></i>). It
        seems more likely that the author of Ms. Fr. 640 was aware of Bernard
        Palissy, as on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/1r/f/1r/tl"><u>1r</u></a>,
        Bernard Palissy is listed (<i><u>Fig. 4</u></i>), as “M{estr}e Bernard palissi inventeur des rustiques

           role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> with a cross marked to the left
        of Palissy’s name. This is close to the designation given to Palissy on

        (Paris, 1580) (<i><u>Fig. 5</u></i>).<a href="#fn7"

    <p>The entry on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/155v/f/155v/tl"><u>155v</u></a>,
        which begins with a call to paint the rose in order to make it appear
        beautiful indicates an attunement to the aesthetic properties of roses.
        This association of roses and beauty was perhaps connected to the lyric
        poetry produced in France in the sixteenth century, in which flowers
        were often used as a central motif. The poems of Pierre de Ronsard
        (1524–85) and Jean de la Taille (1540–1608), for example, gained immense
        popularity in France and frequently referred specifically to flowers.
        Consider, for example, the following poem by Ronsard, published in 1553
        with the collection <em>Les amours</em>:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><em>My pet, come see, this eventide,</em></p>
        <p><em>If that fair rose that opened wide</em></p>
        <p><em>Its crimson robe, at dawn, unto</em></p>
        <p><em>The sun, sees not already flown</em></p>
        <p><em>Its crimsoned folds, and, like your own,</em></p>
        <p><em>Its blush of morning’s tender hue.</em></p>
        <p>***</p>
        <p><em>Ah me, my pet! Alas, see what</em></p>
        <p><em>A little time will do! In but</em></p>
        <p><em>A trice, its beauty wilts, undone.</em></p>
        <p><em>Stepmother nature! Wicked, she,</em></p>
        <p><em>If such a flower — ah me! ah me! —</em></p>
        <p><em>lasts but from morn to setting sun.</em></p>
        <p><em>***</em></p>
        <p><em>Thus, if you heed my word, my pet,</em></p>
        <p><em>Whilst childhood blooms and blossoms yet,</em></p>
        <p><em>Green, fresh and new is the hour:</em></p>
        <p><em>Before it fades, pluck, pluck your youth,</em></p>
        <p><em>Lest, all too soon, old age, forsooth,</em></p>
        <p><em>Wither your beauty, like the flower</em>.<a href="#fn10"

    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>Flowers and their blossoming had long been
        associated with youth and beauty in lyric poetry, a metaphor also
        explored by Francesco Petrarca in his <em>Rerum Vulgarium
            Fragmenta.</em> Within the context of Ronsard’s writings, the rose
        takes an especially central role as a trope through which to praise his
        beloved’s appearance while warning her of its transience. As Ronsard
        expresses in the final verse of the second stanza of the ode, the
        rose—like physical beauty—is subject to the ravages of time and “lasts
        but from morn to setting sun” (v.12).</p>
    <p>One must consider that the same individuals who read poetry by Ronsard
        may also have been consumers of life-cast objects. In the context of the
        rose discussed by the author-practitioner of Ms. Fr. 640, such an object
        would have inspired conversation about the transience of life. One of
        the goals of a life cast was to render everlasting an object whose
        beauty was in equal measure heightened and doomed by its impermanence.
        Furthermore, the poem calls to mind important questions of imitation.
        Ronsard’s poetry is concerned with broader models of poetic imitation in
        the Renaissance, which has been explored in depth by scholars including
        Thomas Greene and, more recently, JoAnn DellaNeva.<a href="#fn11"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref11"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> Greene identifies a certain
        randomness to the borrowings within Ronsard’s poetry, discussing sources
        ranging from Petrarca to Hesiod. DellaNeva, by comparison, explores an
        even more wide-ranging set of Italian poetic sources that informed
        Ronsard’s verse. What is important to stress is that one’s capacity to
        imitate and adhere closely to Petrarchan formulae was highly prized in
        sixteenth-century lyric production. It is worth drawing a parallel,
        therefore, between poetic imitation that would have been clear to
        readers of Ronsard’s poem and the imitation of nature that was central
        to the products of life casting. Like the poems, life casts were prized
        for their ability to imitate their natural counterparts. With the
        subject of the rose to link these two objects of artistic creation, one
        could certainly imagine Renaissance individuals discussing these links
        between poetry and sculpture when standing before a life-cast rose.</p>
    <p>The practice of casting flowers in metal and poetic discourse around
        flowers were directly united in the activities of a major literary
        society in Toulouse, known in the sixteenth century as the College de
        l’Art et Science de Rhétorique. Since 1513 at the latest, the College
        took responsibility for organizing the Jeux Floraux, an annual
        competition first held in Toulouse in May of 1324 to honor achievement
        in lyric poetry.<a href="#fn12"

           id="fnref12"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> Since its inception, the Jeux
        Floraux offered winners prizes of metal flowers. Initially only one
        flower, a golden violet, was offered as a prize, but soon after two
        other flowers—a wild rose (<em>églantine</em>) and a marigold—were also
        awarded to competition winners.<a href="#fn13"

        Isaure, an invented donor who in 1540 was said to have left a bequest to

    <p>The production of such metal flowers suggests that artisans in Toulouse
        had honed particular skills surrounding this type of sculpture, although
        this is not to say that the author-practitioner of Ms. Fr. 640 was
        involved in making these objects for the Jeux Floraux.<a href="#fn16"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref16"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> It does confirm the existence of
        a well-educated audience that esteemed both the finery of metal flowers
        and the treatment of this motif in poetry. Pierre de Ronsard, whose
        lyric poem of 1553 was cited above, received a special honor as part of
        the Jeux Floraux in 1558.<a href="#fn17"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref17"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
    <p>While there is no proof that the author-practitioner of Ms. Fr. 640 was
        himself engaged in poetic production, he may have benefitted from
        contact with individuals involved in the College. A number of poems
        presented there in the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries show an
        interest in alchemy, astrology, and natural philosophy, as François de
        Gélis and John Dawson have both observed in their studies of the
        manuscript documenting the College’s activities.<a href="#fn18"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref18"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> Several such poetic verses cited
        by Dawson seem potentially relevant to the activities of the author of
        Ms. Fr. 640.<a href="#fn19"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref19"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a> For example, the verses “Je suis
        grande alchimiste et qui de la nature/ Recherche curieux les plus rares
        secretz” (I am a great alchemist and I seek with care the rarest secrets
        of nature) from a poem of 1591 show an interest in the transformations
        and secrets of nature. Other verses reference alchemical and
        astrological ideas explicitly, while others are overtly Aristotelian,
        such as “La matière aspirant à la forme parfaicte” (the material aspires
        to the perfect form). If one follows de Gélis and Dawson’s suggestions
        that the Jeux Floraux could foster discourse on these topics, it seems
        possible that the College established a shared space in Toulouse for
        individuals interested in these matters. The objectives of the
        author-practitioner of Ms. Fr. are highly practical and rooted primarily
        in practical processes of making, and thus distant from texts of alchemy
        and natural philosophy, however the College may nonetheless have
        provided a social and intellectual network that nourished the interests
        of the author-practitioner in material transformation and nature’s
        secrets.<a href="#fn20"

                    petals from leaves. See Émile Littré, <em>Dictionnaire de la

                <p> The history of the Jeux Floraux and the shifting
                    institutions surrounding its administration is too complex
                    to be described here. While the exact date in which the
                    Collège de Rhétorique administered the Jeux Floraux is
                    uncertain, it seems likely that this body took control of
                    the games between 1498 and 1513, in coincidence with the
                    dating of a manuscript known as the <em>Livre Rouge</em>,
                    which is separated in two volumes and contains records of
                    the College’s activities. The organizations running the Jeux
                    Floraux had been the Gaya Sciensa (also called the <em>Gay
                        Saber</em>) from 1324 until the late fifteenth century,
                    the Collège de l’Art et Science de Rhétorique until 1694,
                    and the Académie des Jeux Floraux from 1694 onwards. The
                    history of the Jeux Floraux from its inception through the
                    seventeenth century is presented in John Charles Dawson,
                    <em>Toulouse in the Renaissance. The Floral Games;
                        University and Student Life; Etienne Dolet

                        académie (1323–1694)</em> (Geneva: Slatkine, 1981). On
                    the history of the Jeux Floraux after its governing body was
                    officially reorganized as an academy, see Axel Duboul,

                <p>On Clémence Isaure, see Pierre-Louis Boyer, <em>Clémence

                    Atlantica, 2010). While the addition of these particular
                    flowers to the sculptures has not been precisely dated, it
                    seems likely that they were added by 1581, by which time a
                    bronze plaque identifying the figure as Clémence Isaure was
                    placed on the statue’s pedestal. The presence of the flowers
                    is also recorded in eighteenth-century prints showing the
                    statue. See Boyer, <em>Clémence Isaure</em>, 67–77,
