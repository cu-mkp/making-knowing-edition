        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <div>
            <p>Wax and tallow are easily transformed from solid to liquid and
                back again. Their properties, such as hardness, opacity,
                malleability, and carvability, can also be transformed through
                the addition of various substances, including resins, earths,
                and pigments. These versatile materials were used for many
                purposes in early modern Europe, and also possessed a range of
                symbolic, sacramental, and other cultural meanings. Taking
                inspiration from the entry on fol. <a

                for “Modeling in wax,” this essay provides a preliminary
                exploration of the broad uses and meanings of these important
                materials.</p>

    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>Wax and tallow are mentioned throughout
        BnF Ms. Fr. 640, and some entries focus on transforming the qualities of
        the material itself, in particular, to alter its hardness or softness.
        On folio 109r, for example, an entry for “Modeling in wax” recounts
        “When wax is too hard, one mixes in turpentine or a little butter, which
        <del>sont pl</del> renders the wax more amiable, and more appropriate
        than the tallow that the Italians put in....” Given the frequency of wax
        (<em>cire</em>) and tallow (<em>suif</em>) in the manuscript, an
        exploration of their material properties, of their comparative
        performance in processes, and of the ways in which they combine is in
        order. We also explore how these mixtures relate more broadly to themes
        of material transformation in Ms. Fr. 640 and other early modern
        sources.</p>
    <p>In the early modern period, wax was a commonly purchased commodity that
        saw a variety of uses in workshops, apothecaries, and ecclesiastical
        spaces, as well as in the household.<a href="#fn3"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref3"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> It could be used as a means of
        imitation or trickery, as wax easily imitates other materials.<a
           href="#fn4"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref4"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> Tallow, or rendered animal fat,
        was less expensive than wax and more easily sourced. It shared many of
        the material properties and uses of wax, although it was considered a
        material of lower quality.<a href="#fn5"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref5"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> Both wax and tallow were used
        regularly by early modern craftspeople: both could be used to carve and
        model patterns for sculptures,<a href="#fn6"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref6"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> and could be employed in other
        processes, such as copper etching, bronze casting, and gilding.<a

           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref7"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> Both materials were used to make
        candles for illumination, although the greater expense of wax meant it
        was more likely to be used in candles for sacred spaces. Wax and tallow
        readily change from one state to another, from solid to liquid, evoking
        the transformation of other materials, especially glass and metals,
        which also could be melted down and solidified into new objects. This
        ability to transform states lent to wax a spiritual dimension, as seen
        both in alchemical and devotional<a href="#fn8"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref8"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> practices. Moreover, the central
        place of wax as an ingredient in many medicinal remedies, creams,
        ointments, and cosmetics<a href="#fn9"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref9"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> also highlighted its place in
        making substances that themselves could bring about transformation in
        health or in appearance.</p>
    <p>Wax and tallow share more than the ability to move readily from liquid to
        solid and back again. Both substances ideally undergo a purification
        process before they can be used. In the early modern period, wax was
        purified and bleached in earthenware pots, boiled in a mixture of “fresh
        seawater, alum, and saltpetre several times, until no traces of
        impurities remain[ed].”<a href="#fn10"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref10"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> Tallow also underwent a
        purification process before being used, but early modern sources on
        rendering tallow are scarce, perhaps because this process was considered
        common knowledge and thus unimportant to record, similar to recipes for
        making bread.<a href="#fn11"

           id="fnref11"

        our beef fat and pork fat in a modern slow cooker, but this could have
        also been done over many hours in an oven or on a stove. It is essential
        in rendering to apply heat to the fat for many hours without burning it
        and then strain the rendered fat through cheesecloth to remove the
        impurities. This straining process can be repeated multiple times to
        achieve an ever more purified and perhaps firmer substance.</p>
    <p>Variations in wax and tallow reveal different sensory and functional
        properties, and these are noted in early modern sources. In “The Use and
        Abuse of Beeswax,” Guido Antonio Guerzoni writes that in order to assess
        the quality of wax, “one must carefully examine the color. The finest is
        yellow: the lighter it is, the better, and the darker, the worse.”<a
           href="#fn14"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref14"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> In Ms. Fr. 640, the
        author-practitioner refers to “white wax” in many entries, referring to
        a higher quality, more purified wax.<a href="#fn15"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref15"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> Scent could also play a role in
        determining the quality of the wax, as a “rotten or mouldy” scent could
        indicate that tallow had been added to the wax in order to make the
        expensive material go further.<a href="#fn16"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref16"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> Tallow was much easier to
        procure and less expensive than beeswax; the fat of different animals
        could be used, and each of these fats possessed different material
        properties with their own distinct advantages. For instance, lamb tallow
        is mentioned in Ms. Fr. 640 in an entry on burnishing gold, and
        Biringuccio notes goat tallow as an ingredient in a wax mixture.<a
           href="#fn17"

           id="fnref17"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> In our experiments, we rendered
        both beef and pork tallow in multiple iterations. In general, the pork

           id="fnref18"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> than the beef tallow; the
        consistency of the once-rendered beef tallow was reminiscent of mashed
        potatoes, while the consistency of the once-rendered pork was closer to
        thick yogurt. After rendering the fats for an additional five hours, the
        twice-rendered pork fat was even creamier in texture (<i><u>Fig. 1</u></i>); however, the twice-rendered beef fat had a particulate
        consistency that could be compared to hard rice pudding. We believe
        these different consistencies would relate to performance capabilities
        of the tallow.</p>

    <p>On fol. 109r of Ms. Fr. 640, turpentine and butter are listed as
        softening agents for wax, although it is not clear how much should be
        added to achieve the desired texture. This led us to conclude that
        tallow is also a softening agent, although one that, it seems, the
        author-practitioner would prefer not to use.<a href="#fn19"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref19"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a> In our experiments, a 1:1
        mixture of wax and beef tallow yielded a mixture that was soft and
        released easily from the molds but was prone to breaking and cracking
        after it hardened. We therefore opted for mixtures that contained
        smaller amounts of the softening agent than of wax. We made mixtures of
        wax and turpentine, wax and butter, wax and beef tallow, and finally,
        wax and pork tallow. (Table 1) Adding two teaspoons of Venice Turpentine
        to a quarter cup of wax produced a gummy, sticky result that could be
        carved easily with a stylus. The butter, however, when mixed with the
        wax, was difficult to carve: the carving tool got stuck in the material,
        making it difficult to control.<a href="#fn20"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref20"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> Despite the misgivings of the
        manuscript author-practitioner, the tallow mixtures worked particularly
        well for carving. As mentioned above, a 1:1 mixture was too soft and
        fragile, but mixtures that included “a little” tallow (in our
        experiments, two or four teaspoons of tallow to a half cup of wax)
        resulted in a wax that was more malleable than both the pine rosin and
        butter mixtures.<a href="#fn21"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref21"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a> The best mixture was a mixture
        of wax and pork tallow. Carving tools cut cleanly through the material,
        making it easy to manipulate and carve, while the overall structure
        remained solid enough to endure manual manipulation. (<i><u>Fig. 2</u></i>)</p>

    <p>Ms. Fr. 640 also contains information about hardening wax by mixing a bit
        of resin (fols. 120r, 160v, among others). Resin, too, can change
        states, and it appears in several entries in Ms. Fr. 640 (as
        <em>rousine, resine</em>, or <em>la gemme</em>), for, among other
        purposes, in making imitation coral, as an ingredient in purpurine,
        adhering lead to glass, and using resin candles to smoke molds. The
        material we used to try the wax-resin mixture was sold as “pine gum
        rosin,” a refined form of resin. In our experiment, we were concerned
        about mixing the two substances due to the higher melting temperature of
        the pine gum rosin. Would the wax burn or smoke if poured into melted
        rosin? We melted the wax first and then dropped in pieces of the rosin.
        The rosin, like an ice cube in cool water, slowly dissolved and became
        more gelatinous. The resulting mixture once hardened was resistant to
        the impression of the stylus and thus more difficult to carve.</p>
    <p>The softness and hardness of wax and its ability to change from one state
        to another, and to take on different appearances was often remarked upon
        by early modern artisans. Cellini, for example, notes that the seasons
        affect the conditions of wax, and the temperature of the workshop could
        determine how the material responded to the craftperson’s hands and
        tools.<a href="#fn22"
