    <h2 id="counterfeit-jasper">Counterfeit Jasper</h2>
    <p>The entry for “Counterfeit jasper” on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/10r/f/10r/tl"><u>10r</u></a>
        appears to be a single recipe for creating an imitation of the
        semi-precious hardstone jasper by using horn. It can, however, be read
        as two distinct recipes with an accompanying marginal note. The first
        paragraph describes how to transform thinly sliced horn into
        “counterfeit” jasper, cornalines, also known as carnelians, “&amp; other
        stones.” This is done by painting the underside of the horn, which the
        author-practitioner notes will be “a work more appropriate than on
        glass, which is too shiny.” Moreover, the author-practitioner highlights
        horn as a material with similar qualities to jasper in terms of “luster”
        and “fatty polish.” The second paragraph goes on to describe how to use
        the horn “scrapings” to imitate rose petals. Here, the
        author-practitioner presents a way to transform these “scrapings”—the
        curled shavings produced from planing the horn, essentially waste
        material—to imitate the translucency and delicacy of rose petals.<a
           href="#fn1"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref1"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> The marginal note specifies a use
        for the imitation jasper—“you can encrust beds with it”—apparently
        envisioning it being used to inlay wooden bed frames. The note in the
        left margin proffers yet another recipe to “better counterfeit mottled
        jasper” (a variety of jasper that is distinguished by its veins of
        color) through applying “wool with thick hairs dyed in diverse colors
        &amp; intermingled” on the surface of the horn. Thus, fol. 10r in fact
        presents the reader with three distinct processes for transforming horn:
        by painting with colors in “a base with clear turpentine or spike
        lavender varnish,” by applying dyed yarn, and by shaping and coloring
        the horn scrapings into a “rose.”</p>
    <p>The detailed information provided in the body text and marginal note
        indicates that the author-practitioner probably performed this procedure
        himself, rather than simply recording the recipe. This essay discusses
        the author-practitioner’s experiential knowledge of horn and its
        intrinsic properties, particularly with regard to his use of such terms
        as “thin,” “luster,” and “fatty polish.” These elements of the recipe
        raise questions about the possible optical effects of painted horn,
        which is used to imitate two very different things, jasper and rose
        petals. Further questions touched upon in this essay include: how can
        this recipe for “Counterfeit jasper” shed new light on our understanding
        of the early modern culture of imitation?<a href="#fn2"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref2"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> Are examples of furniture inlay
        extant with painted horn, genuine jasper or other luxury materials, such
        as tortoise shell? How does reconstruction assist in understanding the
        qualities of translucency, luster, and fatty polish to which the
        author-practitioner refers? In addition, this essay examines the
        possible context of this entry in examples of <em>pietre dure</em> work
        and inlaid furniture of the Renaissance, especially that created by the
        tarsia technique that used inlays of stained woods, bone, and horn to
        create geometric patterns and Moresque decoration.</p>
    <h2 id="horn-and-furniture-inlay">Horn and Furniture Inlay</h2>
    <p>Horn is an organic material, the keratinous tissue that covers the bony
        core on the heads of certain bovine and ovine animals.<a href="#fn3"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref3"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> It is a versatile material that
        can be shaped, and it is pliable when heated at low temperatures. Horn
        was used historically in the production of a wide range of objects, from
        the mundane to the luxurious: handles for tools, buttons, combs, boxes,
        and jewels, to name just a few. This material versatility is reflected
        on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/10r/f/10r/tl"><u>10r</u></a>,
        where horn is used to imitate precious jasper and carnelian, but the
        author-practitioner also points to its more utilitarian uses by
        directing the reader to “take horn from which one makes lanterns.” This
        reference to lanterns points to a ubiquitous domestic use of horn in
        European culture (<i><u>Fig. 1</u></i>). Pliny commented on the common
        use of horn as a substitute for glass window panes.<a href="#fn4"

           id="fnref4"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> A recipe for making horn for

        this text gives directions about how to work horn to make lanterns, it
        does not specify the type of horn to use. Ms. Fr. 640 also contains a
        recipe entitled “Softening horn” on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/15v/f/15v/tl"><u>15v</u></a>,
        which contains a short description of how to make horn pliable by
        soaking small pieces in hot water in order to inlay them into “certain
        little boxes.” Adele Schaverien discusses a manuscript which contains
        two recipes for softening all kinds of horn.<a href="#fn6"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref6"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> These recipes include two methods
        to heat the horn: boiling it in a cauldron, or roasting it in a fire.
        Schaverien explains that the same recipes would also be used to soften
        ivory, bone, and wood, stating that “the tools to work the horn have
        hardly changed, and they are still made by the craftsman himself and are
        similar to those found in a woodworker’s workshop.”<a href="#fn7"

        to using the imitation jasper as an inlay for a bed brings into view the
        domestic interior. Although there are few surviving beds from this
        period, and none that we know of with inlay, there is a late
        fifteenth-century Venetian painting by Vittore Carpaccio, “The Dream of
        St. Ursula” (ca. 1495),<a href="#fn8"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref8"

        bed, covered by a red canopy, with visible inlay decoration in its
        platform (<i><u>Fig. 2</u></i>). This type of geometric inlay technique
        is found in Venetian objects from about 1450 onwards, particularly in
        caskets and cabinets, which typically combined stained wood and bone to
        create the pattern. It is often described as “certosino work,” although
        Peter Thornton uses the term <em>lavoro di intarsio</em> to refer to
        this geometric inlay because <em>allo certosino</em> is an anachronistic
        twentieth-century term.<a href="#fn9"

        inlaid with small pieces of partly stained wood and bone, as well as
        horn (the horn stained black) (<i><u>Fig. 3</u></i>). The mosaic inlay
        on its lid resembles patterns from the Islamic world, which reflects the
        close trading contacts of Venice with the eastern Mediterranean, and
        points to the Arabic origins of the technique.</p>

    <p>Decorative inlay has a long history. The craftspeople of ancient Egypt
        decorated wooden furniture with contrasting inlays. During the medieval
        period, this technique continued to flourish in cities in the Islamic
        world, such as Cairo and Damascus, where patterns were created using
        tiny inlaid pieces of bone, ivory and various woods. This type of
        geometric tarsia (from the Arabic <em>tarsi</em>, meaning
        “incrustation”) was produced in Islamic Spain as early as the tenth
        century. The workshops of Cordoba and later Granada seem to have
        specialized in the technique, known in Spanish as <em>taracea</em>.<a

        Fr. 640, another version of <em>taracea</em> can be found on a chest
        produced in Catalonia from around 1550–1650 (<i><u>Fig. 4</u></i>).
        Decorated with “moresque” geometric patterns and other motifs, this
        Spanish chest is made of walnut wood inlaid with marquetry of bone and
        colored woods. While this chest does not include the horn inlay found on
        the Venetian casket, other pieces show that horn was applied both as
        inlay and as a veneer in the same way as bone, tortoiseshell, and
        ivory.<a href="#fn11"

        procedure in Ms. Fr. 640 differs in that the horn is not stained or

        in imitation of jasper, which is intended to result in a translucent

    <p>Another context in which fol. 10r might be understood is the practice of
        <em>pietre dure</em> inlay. The combination of wood and polychrome stone
        was already present in Florence and Venice by the first half of the
        sixteenth century.<a href="#fn12"

        jasper, and ivory (<i><u>Fig. 5</u></i>). In the second edition of his
        <em>Lives</em>, published in 1568, Vasari notes that the artisan who

    <h2 id="reconstruction">Reconstruction</h2>
    <p>It is worth emphasizing that the recipe on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/10r/f/10r/tl"><u>10r</u></a>
        in Ms. Fr. 640 does not give any detail about how to prepare or work the
        horn.<a href="#fn15"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref15"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> Instead the author-practitioner
        advises starting with horn “from which one makes lanterns.” With Dr.
        Donna Bilak, who has a background in jewelry making, we were able to cut
        the horn plates into smaller pieces using a jeweler’s saw, and then
        filed them to smooth out the roughened surface. As conceptually simple
        as “cutting horn” may sound, it cannot be so easily described without
        first attempting it in practice (<i><u>Fig. 6</u></i>). The jeweler’s
        saw only got us so far. In order to cut the horn thinner, we were
        fortunate to be able to call upon Joseph Godla, Chief Conservator at the
        Frick Collection, who, with a background as a cabinetmaker, had the
        necessary tools in his workshop. Godla used a wood plane to shave the
        horn, although he had to sharpen the edge several times, explaining how
        much harder horn was to plane than wood (<i><u>Fig. 7</u></i>). We saved
        a pile of horn scrapings to use in our reconstruction of the
        author-practitioner’s instructions in the recipe “Counterfeit jasper”
        that "You know how, with scrapings of the said horn, roses can be imitated." In this, he seems to be referring to another recipe on fol.
        10r, “Roses,” in which he instructs the reader to imitate roses: “These
        are counterfeited either with the scrapings of <em>
            <del>[illegible]</del>
        </em> horn used for lanterns, or with scrapings of parchment, very clear
        &amp; delicate &amp; dyed &amp; employed as you know.” The horn
        scrapings, comparable to wood shavings, had a white-yellowish color,
        and, in texture and translucency, they did look similar to parchment (<i><u>Fig. 8</u></i>).</p>

    <p>Our reconstruction of “jasper” raised questions about the properties of
        the stone which the horn was intended to imitate. The recipe is clear
        about what the horn should look like: thin and translucent like glass,
        but also keeping its “fatty polish” to resemble jasper (fol. 10r). The
        term “fatty polish” was used up to the nineteenth century to describe
        the greasy or waxy luster of some stones.<a href="#fn16"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref16"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> Moreover, the
        author-practitioner emphasizes that the colors must not be opaque,
        squeezing into the space below the entry that “colors matte in body are
        not so appropriate here, although they are very beautiful,” and that the
        colors should have a base of “clear turpentine or spike lavender
        varnish.” As a type of hardstone, jasper is found in nature in diverse
        colors, in both opaque and translucent varieties. Red jasper can display
        a similar color to carnelian, a variety of chalcedony, which is
        characterized by its orange-reddish color and is semi-transparent.<a

        Charles IV made with this variety (<i><u>Fig. 9</u></i>). Chalcedony, as
        well as agates and jasper, were imitated in glass, known as <em>vetri

    <p>The recipe specified horn from lanterns because it is thin and
        translucent, and it is supposed to show “a luster &amp; fatty polish
        like jasper.” The painted side of our horn was glossy and shiny, and
        when viewed on the unpainted side, the horn could be seen as having a
        “fatty polish” (<i><u>Fig. 12</u></i>). Applying spike lavender oil on
        the back of the horn, as the recipe directs, made the horn more
        translucent (<i><u>Fig. 13</u></i>). Thus, painting the horn on one side
        and oiling it on the other produced the glossy, polished, and
        translucent qualities of jasper that the author-practitioner sought.</p>

    <p>Two examples of marquetry inlaid with painted horn in imitation of luxury
        materials date to about one hundred years after the manuscript was
        compiled. One is a wig cabinet (<i><u>Fig. 14</u></i>), that features
        horn painted to imitate more expensive tortoiseshell.<a href="#fn23"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref23"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a> Another intriguing example of
        painted horn is a luxurious writing table from ca. 1670 that appears in
        the posthumous inventory of Louis XIV (<i><u>Fig. 15</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 16</u></i>). In this example, the horn inlaid in the table is
        painted on its underside, just as the author-practitioner of Ms. Fr. 640
        directs. In this case, however, it is blue in imitation of the hardstone
        lapis lazuli. Recent research on this table suggests that this imitation
        also reflects the aesthetic of blue and white porcelain, a highly
        desirable object much traded and imitated in the seventeenth century.<a

    <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Because horn takes paint and dye well, it was often stained to emulate
        more expensive tortoiseshell, as seen in the wig cabinet. We could not
        locate other contemporary recipes that called for painted horn, however
        we found many recipes to dye horn, including a recipe on fol. 78v, “for
        making bone or horn green.” We also were not successful in locating
        extant examples of inlaid furniture that contained imitation jasper
        created with horn. Moreover, as seen in the historical examples
        illustrated above, horn used in intarsia appears opaque, whereas the
        recipe on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/10r/f/10r/tl"><u>10r</u></a>
        specifically instructs the reader to paint it with colors in combination
        with varnish in order to recreate the luster, “fatty polish,” and
        translucency of jasper: “colors matte in body are not so appropriate
        here, although they are very beautiful.” The author-practitioner also
        stresses thinning the horn to obtain the translucency and fatty polish
        desired, which will enable the colors to be seen from the underside. In
        our reconstruction of the “counterfeit jasper,” the colored varnish gave
        the horn a brilliant, glossy finish. Finally, we followed the
        author-practitioner’s directions to use the scrapings of the horn to
        make roses (<i><u>Fig. 17</u></i>). In this seeming afterthought, as
        well as in the additions at the bottom and in the margins of the
        counterfeit jasper recipe, the author-practitioner appears to be writing
        from personal experience.</p>
