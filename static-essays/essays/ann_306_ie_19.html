        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <div>
            <p>Ms. Fr. 640 contains more diverse and detailed instructions for
                the making of varnishes than any other sixteenth-century text.
                The varnish recipes in Ms. Fr. 640 are wide-ranging, from the
                protection of metals from corrosion, to the rain proofing of
                ephemeral festive decorations, to an ingredient in printer’s
                ink, to the imitation of other materials such as coral and gold,
                to the perhaps best known use of historical varnishes today, as
                coatings for easel paintings. This essay shows why the remarks
                and recipes in Ms. Fr. 640 about varnishes are of inestimable
                value in chronicling a previously unrecognized shift in the
                ingredients, preparation, uses, and aims of varnishes from the
                middle ages through the seventeenth century.</p>

    <p>BnF Ms. Fr. 640 contains a surprising number of recipes for the
        preparation of varnish, a substance the author-practitioner calls
        <em>vernis</em>.<a href="#fn1"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> There is in fact not a single earlier
        treatise that contains such diverse and detailed instructions for the
        making of varnish as this late sixteenth-century French manuscript. A
        varnish is commonly understood as a final coating that, depending on its
        ingredients, dries into a colorless transparent film or a colored
        translucent film. In the past, varnishes were applied to a multitude of
        (art) objects, including metalwork, woodwork, leather, textiles, and
        glass. The varnish recipes in Ms. Fr. 640 are similarly wide-ranging:
        varnish is used for more practical purposes such as the protection of
        metals from corrosion<a href="#fn2"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> and the rain proofing of ephemeral
        festive decorations;<a href="#fn3"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> it is used as an ingredient in printer’s
        ink;<a href="#fn4"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> it plays an important role in the
        imitation of other materials such as coral<a href="#fn5"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> and gold;<a href="#fn6"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> and, perhaps the best known use of
        historical varnishes today: as coatings for easel paintings. On a
        painted surface, the purpose of a varnish is twofold—it may be used to
        protect the painted object from the atmosphere and mechanical damage—to
        make it more durable as it were—and it may also have an important
        optical function, including unifying the painted surface and bringing
        out its colors.</p>
    <p>Ms. Fr. 640’s entries on the varnishing of easel painting are of
        particular interest because the author-practitioner makes several
        pertinent observations about the differences between the varnishing of
        oil paintings in his own time as compared to earlier periods. Although
        these insights find echoes in other recipe collections and treatises—an
        important testimony to the artisanal reality the author practitioner’s
        recipes may be rooted in—Ms. Fr. 640 is singular in the level of detail
        it provides regarding the state of the art of painter’s varnish. Studied
        together, the recipes contained in this late sixteenth-century French
        manuscript thus provide a unique window into varnishing practice at the
        time—highlighting recent developments in the art of oil painting not
        documented in treatises written before or during the compilation of Ms.
        Fr. 640.</p>
    <h2 id="varnish-before-ms.-fr.-640">Varnish Before Ms. Fr. 640</h2>
    <p>To understand the full significance of the varnish recipes contained in
        Ms. Fr. 640, we first need a brief introduction to the history of
        varnishing before the sixteenth century. Recipes show that between the
        twelfth and fifteenth centuries, nearly all varnishes were oil-resin
        varnishes made by dissolving resins in hot oils. The main ingredients
        for varnish at this time are drying oils, typically linseed oil and
        sometimes walnut oil, mixed with one or more plant resins such as
        sandarac (from <em>Tetraclinis articulata</em> (Vahl) Masters or
        <em>Juniperus</em> spp.).<a href="#fn7"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Natural resins are sticky, flammable,
        organic substances of vegetable origin (except for shellac, an insect
        secretion). They harden on exposure to oxygen and are insoluble in water
        but partly or wholly soluble in alcohol, drying oils, or volatile oils
        such as oil of turpentine.</p>
    <p>As I previously argued in <em>The Varnish and the Glaze</em> (2023),
        medieval artisans required oil-resin varnishes to transform painted and
        gilded wood into the appearance of a goldsmith’s work, a practice I
        refer to as “material mimesis,” in which one or more materials are
        transformed so that they take on the appearance of another material.<a
           href="#fn8"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> For this purpose, thick and dark
        oil-resin varnishes, sometimes colored yellow with plant dyes and other
        substances, were especially suited. Applied in multiple layers to metal
        leaf or paint, such varnishes helped create a shiny surface that
        approximated the appearance of polished precious stones, enamel, and the
        color and shine of gold (<i><span class="underline">Fig.
                1</span></i>).<a href="#fn9"

    <p>The incorporation of relatively hard resins such as sandarac into a
        drying oil is not easy. It requires extensive heat and even then there
        will be some resin left after mixing has occurred. The result of such
        extensive heating is a dark and viscous substance (<i><span

    <p>Medieval oil-resin varnishes were indeed so thick that, as most recipes
        point out, they had to be applied with your hands or with a sponge.
        Medieval artisans also had to account for the weather when applying
        oil-resin varnishes. Recipes explain that the sun helps varnishes become
        less viscous (resins, being thermoplastic, become softer upon heating)
        and their exposure to the sun for a period of time also helps harden the
        oil component in oil-resin varnishes during curing.</p>
    <p>For over three-hundred years, nearly all varnish recipes for wood and
        metal are variations of these substances—more or less complex mixtures
        of drying oils and plant resins. But in the fifteenth century, recipe
        collections, now often written in the vernacular rather than Latin, show
        that varnishing practice is slowly changing. Recipes increasingly
        mention the need for varnishes to dry quickly and to be of a relatively
        light color. Walnut oil, which is paler compared to linseed oil, becomes
        more popular, and relatively colorless resins such as mastic, a resin
        derived from an evergreen shrub known as <em>Pistacia lentiscus</em>
        growing in North Africa and Southern Europe, become increasingly
        important in the production of varnishes as well. Recipes also explain
        that ingredients such as bread, bone ash, and alum (a chemical compound,
        usually a hydrated double sulfate salt of aluminium) are added during
        the preparation of varnish to help clarify and increase its curing time
        by ridding the oil component of mucilages.<a href="#fn10"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
    <p>In the course of the sixteenth century, technical treatises include the
        first recipes for so-called solvent-based varnishes. Solvent-based
        varnishes are made with natural resins such as turpentine, an oleoresin,
        easily dissolved in a volatile oil, usually made by distilling these
        same oleoresins. Turpentine oleoresin is exuded by the different genera
        of Pinaceae trees. This includes the pines (<em>Pinus</em> spp.), which
        produce an oleoresin known as “common turpentine;” the European larch
        tree (<em>Larix decidua</em>), which produces what became known as
        turpentine of Venice; and the various species of fir (<em>Abies</em>),
        which produce what became known as Strasbourg turpentine.<a href="#fn11"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Unlike resins such as sandarac or
        mastic, which quickly harden into brittle tears after exudation and are
        collected as such, the various turpentine oleoresins are tapped in a
        semiliquid state owing to their relatively high ratio of volatile
        components. This makes them particularly suitable for distillation, and
        the distillate of turpentine oleoresins (i.e., a volatile oil) became
        known as “turpentine oil.” To blend oleoresins with (volatile) oils
        requires much less heat (if any) than blending (volatile) oils with hard
        and solid resins such as sandarac. As a result, varnishes made with
        oleoresins and their distillates are of a relatively light color, and,
        due to the relatively high volatile oil component in such varnishes,
        they are less viscous than traditional oil-resin varnishes and do not
        require additional heating upon application or during curing.</p>
    <p>Sixteenth-century recipes indeed mention that solvent-based varnishes are
        so thin that they can be applied with a brush, or the tip of your
        finger, and, depending on their preparation, they have the ability to
        dry in as little as half an hour without requiring the sun’s heat. To
        make and apply this type of varnish therefore, an artisan is not
        constrained by certain weather conditions as was the case with the
        medieval oil-resin varnishes which could only be applied and cured in
        the sun. But, unlike the earlier medieval recipes, which clearly embed
        varnishing practice in a context of material mimesis, looking to imitate
        the splendor of gold and precious stones with thick, dark, and shiny
        substances, fifteenth- and early sixteenth-century recipes are
        remarkably silent about the reasons for the apparent changes in the
        varnishing practices they record. What is more, most of these treatises
        do not explain the uses for the varnish recipes they include.</p>
    <h2 id="turpentine-varnish-for-panel-paintings">Turpentine Varnish for Panel
        Paintings</h2>
    <p>Ms. Fr. 640 stands out therefore, because, unlike other mid to late
        sixteenth-century recipe collections, it provides us with surprisingly
        detailed information about the varnishing practices it
        records—specifically about the state of the art of varnishing easel
        paintings. Throughout the manuscript, including in recipes for
        varnishing objects other than paintings, the author-practitioner
        includes remarks about best practices, what materials to avoid when
        varnishing easel paintings, and why. One such remark can be found on one
        of the first folios of the manuscript (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/3r"><span
                  class="underline">3r</span></a>), in a recipe that describes
        how to make “varnish for panels” (<em>Vernis pour tableaulx</em>) with
        turpentine and oil of turpentine. This, indeed, would have been a
        so-called solvent-based varnish. We learn that you have to heat your
        oleoresin “venice turpentine” (<em>tourmentine de venise</em>), and, as
        soon as it reaches the right temperature, you must add its distillate:
        “turpentine oil the whitest you can procure” (<em>de tormentine de la
            plus blanche que tu pourras</em>). Once these two ingredients have
        been properly united, the substance is immediately taken from the fire.
        The recipe continues that this varnish can also be made without the
        fire, but that this makes it less “desiccative,” that is, that it dries
        less quickly. According to the author-practitioner, the varnish thus
        made is “appropriate for panel paintings and other painted things
        without distorting the colors or yellowing” (<em>Il saproprie sur les
            tableaulx &amp; aultres choses painctes sans corrompre les couleurs
            ne jaulnir</em>). This comment shows that, applied to panel
        paintings and other colored objects, the yellowing of varnish as time
        passes, or the use of a varnish that is yellow to begin with, seems to
        have been something undesirable to the author of Ms. Fr. 640. A yellow
        varnish such as the medieval oil-resin varnish can indeed distort the
        colors of a painting, or have this effect as it turns yellow due to
        aging (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 3</span></i>).</p>

                indicates, the oil-resin varnish on the left changes the blue
                paint it coats to green. The solvent-based varnish made with
                turpentine oil and oleoresin does not have any noticeable
                influence on the color of the blue paint underneath. © Photo:

            </figcaption>
        </figure>
    </div>
    <p>In the same varnish recipe, the author-practitioner also points out that
        for its application the painter is not bound to time of day or season.
        The varnish made with turpentine resin and turpentine oil “dries both in
        the shade and in the sun and overnight, and during the winter as well as
        in the summer” (<em>Et seiche a lombre &amp; au soleil &amp; du jour au
            lendemain Et aussy bien en hiver quen este</em>). Again, very
        different from medieval oil-resin varnish that required the sun’s heat
        for application and curing and was therefore dependent on favorable
        weather conditions. Ms. Fr. 640 contains more such remarks in which the
        author-practitioner expresses concerns with the viscosity, hue, and
        appropriate weather conditions for the application of varnish. For
        instance, in the margins of this recipe (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/3r"><span
                  class="underline">3r</span></a>), we are offered some
        additional information on how to prepare and use the “varnish for
        panels”:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>A little more turpentine than turpentine oil is needed in order to
            give body to the varnish, which needs to be applied with finger in
            order to spread it thinner and less thick, for when it is thick, it
            turns yellow and sticks. One does not varnish to make paintings
            shine, for it just takes the light out of them. But it is used to
            heighten colors which have soaked in and to keep them from dust.
            Mastic varnish does not resist rain, whereas that of oil and rosin
            does.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>The solvent-based varnish described here
        was applied thinly with the finger over the surface of the painting.
        Indeed, although a little “body” was required for the varnish for
        panels, the author-practitioner stresses that only a relatively thin
        application of varnish would ensure that the coating does not become too
        sticky or gives a yellow hue to a painting’s colors.<a href="#fn12"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> This recipe also shows that, unlike
        what we have seen with medieval varnishes, Ms. Fr. 640’s varnish for
        panels is not meant to make paintings “shine.” Strong reflections on a
        shiny varnish impede visibility of the painted surface underneath.
        Similarly, a recipe on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/66r/f/66r/tc"><span
                  class="underline">66r</span></a>, entitled “Colors in oil that
        are imbibed” (<em>Couleurs a huile qui semboivent</em>), describes the
        painter’s struggle with oil paints that remain shiny on drying. Varnish
        is here brought up as a remedy to this problem. We learn that colors in
        oil are “imbibed” when they do “not remain shiny after they are dry”
        (<em>ne demeurent point luisantes apres quelles sont seiches</em>). Some
        oil colors, however, are more prone to staying shiny on
        drying—<em>azure</em> is mentioned as one of these pigments in a
        marginal note on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/61v/f/61v/tc"><span
                  class="underline">61v</span></a>. When parts of the painting

        result is an uneven paint surface. In the recipe on fol. <a

                  class="underline">66r</span></a>, the author-practitioner
        explains that this problem can be resolved with varnish that “mends all
        this &amp; unites &amp; renders it similar in one place as in
        another”(<em>Le vernis racoustre tout cela &amp; lunist &amp; rend
            semblable aulta[n]t en un endroit quen laultre</em>).<a href="#fn13"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Different from the medieval artisan
        who <em>required</em> shiny paints and varnishes to transform painted
        wood into the appearance of gold, gems, and enamel, the
        author-practitioner of Ms. Fr. 640 shows that the main function of
        varnish had changed to bringing out the colors of the painted surface
        and to protect paintings from dust and other damage. Another recipe for
        a solvent-based varnish, included on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/3r"><span
                  class="underline">3r</span></a>–v, provides more insight into
        why this apparent change in varnishing practice took place.</p>
    <h2 id="varnish-for-floorboards">Varnish for Floorboards</h2>
    <p>The recipe in question explains how to make to make “thick varnish for
        floorboards” (<em>Gros vernis pour le plancher</em>). It is introduced
        with reference to another varnish for floorboards that, so we learn,
        “takes a long time to dry &amp; drips more than two months after it has
        been applied to the planks.” The author-practitioner explains that this
        varnish of earlier days was “made of linseed oil, garlic boiled in it to
        extinguish it &amp; rid it of grease, &amp; with wheat.” On fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/search/folio/74r"><span
                  class="underline">74r</span></a>–v, Ms. Fr. 640 includes a
        recipe that explains in more detail how to make such an oil-resin
        varnish with bread, and, in this recipe, also alum. The recipe, entitled
        <em>Pour faire verny</em>, explains that one pound of linseed oil is
        mixed with bread and three onions in an earthen pot and cooked on a
        charcoal fire for five hours. You then make a separate mixture with
        “half an ounce of flour glue” cooked “just as before” in which you put
        “two ounces of well-pestled sandarac.” This is again cooked as per
        earlier instructions before “you will take mastic &amp; [gum] arabic,
        two ounces each, which will both be well ground.” Accordingly you put
        everything (your linseed oil and your resin mixture) together and cook
        this mixture for another five hours. When this is done, two ounces of
        alum are added and the varnish is cooked again. To finish, the varnish
        is filtered by pouring it through a tightly woven cloth, a common
        practice for the preparation of oil-resin varnishes that can be found in
        many medieval varnish recipes as well. The author-practitioner does not
        explain what this varnish would potentially have been used for but in a
        recipe on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/4v"><span
                  class="underline">4v</span></a>, entitled “Black varnish for

            despee bandes de bahus &amp;c</em>) we are provided with similar
        instructions that explain how to cook linseed oil with garlic, hog’s
        fennel, and “some also add breadcrusts” before “black pitch” (<em>poix

        recipe in which the author-practitioner provides instructions for
        cooking linseed oil “to make ink for copper plates”:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>[...] one needs to boil walnut oil or, even better, linseed oil for a
            long time. &amp; having boiled for a long time, you will put in
            garlic &amp; bread crusts to rid it of grease &amp; leave again to
            boil thoroughly, then finally you put in one part of lampblack that
            you have previously ground on marble with oil.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>Further down the same recipe the
        author-practitioner inserts an important safety warning for making this
        substance which can also be found in various medieval treatises:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Linseed oil thickens while boiling &amp; becomes like a varnish &amp;
            is in danger of catching fire. Therefore, when you boil it, make
            sure it is in an open space or in a place where the flame cannot
            cause damage.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>In Ms. Fr. 640, linseed oil or walnut oil varnish prepared in this manner
        thus appears to have played an important role in the coating of metals,
        either for armor and swords or as an ink for printing. Significantly,
        recipes explaining how to prepare linseed oil varnishes with ingredients
        similar to the ones described above, first appear in recipe collections
        dating to the fifteenth century—about one hundred years before Ms. Fr.
        640 was written. They can for instance be found in a manuscript known as
        the <em>Liber illuministarum</em> (Cgm 821, Bayerische Staatsbibliothek,
        Munich), compiled at the monastery at Tegernsee between the second half
        of the fifteenth century and the first decades of the sixteenth
        century.<a href="#fn16"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> One of these recipes introduces a
        method for cooking oil before it is mixed with resin. The oil must be
        cooked with nine slices of “house bread” (<em>hausprot</em>) and a
        material called <em>alaun</em> (alum) until the bread turns brown.
        Another recipe in the same manuscript explains the role of bread in
        preparing an oil-resin varnish used to imitate gold. The recipe
        describes how to make a gold-colored varnish for tin by mixing together
        several ingredients including a plant resin, likely sandarac
        (<em>fuerneis</em>), a red lead-based pigment (<em>mini)</em> and
        linseed oil (<em>leinoell</em>) or poppyseed oil (<em>magoell</em>).
        While mixing these materials, a slice of bread is added because it
        “attracts impurities present in the oil” (<em>ain schnitel prot quia
            attrahit immundiciam olei)</em>. Removing impurities from the oil
        not only helps make the substance clearer but also makes it dry
        better.<a href="#fn17"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
    <p>In the fifteenth century, these efforts for improving the clarity and
        drying properties of oil-resin varnishes are a first testament to a
        changing attitude as to what was considered a “good” varnish. It is
        therefore especially interesting that by the end of the sixteenth
        century, the author of Ms. Fr. 640 mentions using such oil-resin
        varnishes for coating metals and printer’s ink but considers them unfit
        for use in the art of painting because “they yellowed &amp; rendered
        greenish the blue color of paintings” (<em>Et cestuy cy jaulnissoict
            &amp; rendoit
            <br>
            verdastre la couleur bleue des tableaulx
        </em>, fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/3r"><span
                  class="underline">3r</span></a>). What is more, according to
        the author-practitioner, the oil-resin varnish appears to have gone out
        of fashion even for the varnishing of floorboards. For this, he
        similarly recommends using a solvent-based varnish because “it does not
        drip like that of times past” (<em>ne degoute poinct comme celuy du
            temps passé</em>). The recipe on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/3r"><span
                  class="underline">3r</span></a>–v continues that the varnish
        for floorboards is “made like the varnish for panels except that one
        puts coarse common turpentine instead of fine turpentine” (<em>Cestuy se
            faict comme laultre horsmis quon mect grosse tourmentine commune au
            lieu de tourmentine fine</em>). As we have seen above in “Varnish
        for panels” on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/3r"><span
                  class="underline">3r</span></a>, the turpentine oleoresin
        referred to as Venice turpentine was used to make the painter’s varnish.
        Since turpentine oleoresins are exuded by the different genera of
        Pinaceae trees, they all have slightly different characteristics;
        “Venice turpentine”—from the larch tree—is characterized by being
        comparably clear and colorless, while “common turpentine”—from pines—was
        known to be more yellow and viscous. Since a yellow colour was not a
        desirable quality for materials used to make painters’ varnishes, common
        turpentine was considered less suitable than the “finer” qualities of
        turpentine resin such as Venice turpentine. For protecting your
        floorboards, however, common turpentine’s yellowness would have been
        less relevant and perhaps even a desirable characteristic as it would
        give a warmer tone to the wood.</p>
    <h2 id="imitating-the-polish-of-ebony">Imitating the Polish of Ebony</h2>
    <p>The previous recipes show that to avoid distorting the colors of a
        painting, any kind of yellow hue, whether caused by the materials used
        to make varnish, caused by its application, or caused by the yellowing
        of varnish as it ages, had to be avoided as much as possible. The
        author-practitioner comes back to this point one more time in a recipe
        on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/4r/f/4r/tc"><span
                  class="underline">4r</span></a> that explains how to make a
        varnish “that is promptly dry” with spike lavender oil (<em>Vernis
            dhuile daspic</em>). Spike lavender oil, the distillate from a
        distinct variety of lavender, <em>lavandula latifiola</em>, also known
        as <em>lavandula spica,</em> can be used to dissolve resins and or be
        used as a thinner for varnishes similar to oil of turpentine used in the
        recipe on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/3r"><span
                  class="underline">3r</span></a>. To make this varnish, one
        pound (<em>lb</em>) of spike lavender oil has to be mixed with five
        ounces (<em>cinq onces</em>) of “powdered sandarac” (<em>la gomme de
            sandaraque en pouldre</em>):</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>One needs to heat spike lavender oil and as it begins to simmer, put
            in powdered sandarac gum so that it soon melts. And over a charcoal
            fire stir continuously until the sandarac is well melted, which you
            will know by taking a little of the said varnish on a plate. And if
            it is fatty when you handle it with a finger, it is
            ready.<sup>⁠</sup></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>In sixteenth-century France, the pound
        (<em>livre</em> from Latin <em>libra</em>) was divided into sixteen
        ounces and this means that the ratio of sandarac to spike lavender oil
        is about one to three in this recipe. We learn that “some only put in
        four ounces” of sandarac, but that “this is not so good, nor so fatty.”
        Here, unlike in the recipes for easel paintings, the fattiness of this
        varnish was considered an important characteristic of the substance. The
        reason for this becomes clear from the remainder of the recipe. We learn
        that “frame makers, to avoid the trouble of polishing their ebony,
        varnish it with this, as do guitar makers” (<em>Cestuy cy est
            promptem[ent] sec Les quadraniers pour eviter la peyne de polir leur
            hebene le vernissent de cestuy cy Les quiterniers aussi</em>).
        Sixteenth-century musical instruments and painting frames were indeed
        often (partly) made from ebony wood, such as a 1596 lute (<i><span
                  class="underline">Fig. 4</span></i>, <i><span
                  class="underline">Fig. 5</span></i>), and the ca. 1590 casetta
        frame (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 6</span></i>) both held by the
        Metropolitan Museum of Art.</p>

    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>Whether these objects were sometimes
        varnished in place of receiving a polish remains to be seen. Whatever
        may be the case, the recipe for Ms. Fr. 640’s spike lavender-sandarac
        varnish suggests that this coating was meant to substitute the gloss of
        polished wood, which, in the case of extremely hard wood species such as
        ebony, would have taken a considerably long time to achieve by hand.</p>
    <p>But this varnish was not considered appropriate for everything. The
        author-practitioner warns the reader that, even though this spike
        lavender-sandarac varnish may be suitable for the “moldings of panels,”
        it should not be used on the surface of paintings. For this, “fine
        turpentine” (<em>tourmentine fine</em>) has to be used instead.<a
           href="#fn18"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> In the margin of the same fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/4r/f/4r/tc"><span
                  class="underline">4r</span></a>, the author-practitioner
        explains why this is so: spike lavender varnish is not as appropriate
        because it “eats away at the colors since it is too penetrating”
        (<em>mange les couleurs pour estre trop penetra[n]t</em>). The
        author-practitioner continues this point in more detail in another
        recipe on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/search/folio/56r/"><span
                  class="underline">56r</span></a> that instructs how to make a
        “varnish for distemper” (<em>Vernis pour destrempe,</em> i.e, a painting
        made with a water-based binder—animal glue in this recipe). The varnish
        for distemper paint is made with “clear Venice turpentine” and “some
        spike lavender oil” without using a fire. Again, the author-practitioner
        stresses that it is not suitable for panels:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>This one is for things in distemper, and the turpentine varnish that
            you know, for panels. Pure spike lavender oil varnish is not good
            for panels, for spike lavender oil is too penetrating &amp; makes
            colors sparkle, unless it was made long ago [<em>Le vernis pur
                daspic nest pas bon pour les tableaulx car lhuile daspic est
                trop penetrant &amp; faict petiller les couleurs sil nest de
                long temps faict</em>].</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>This recipe also shows the importance of
        creating a uniform painted surface that, as we have also seen in the
        recipe for “Colors in oil that are imbibed” on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/66r/f/66r/tl"><span
                  class="underline">66r</span></a>, should not be shiny, and
        therefore certainly not “sparkly” as the author-practitioner suggests
        would be the result of using a spike lavender varnish. Let us return one
        more time to the recipe for spike lavender varnish on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/4r/f/4r/tc"><span
                  class="underline">4r</span></a> because it concludes with a
        most interesting comment about the history of the use of linseed oil
        varnishes on landscape paintings:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>One did not use to varnish the landscape of a panel when linseed
            varnish was in use, because it yellowed the landscape [<em>On ne
                souloit poinct vernir les paisages dun tableau quand le vernis
                de lin estoict en usage pource quil faisoict jaulnir le
                paisage</em>]. But with varnish made with turpentine
            [<em>tourmentine</em>], one varnishes everywhere. You can put in
            pulverized mastic [<em>mastic pulverise</em>] extracted in tears or
            otherwise, and it will be more desiccative [<em>desiccatif</em> ],
            than with sandarac [<em>sandaraque</em>].</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>What stands out here is the observation
        that landscapes were not varnished when linseed oil was still the main
        ingredient of oil-resin varnishes. This suggests that until a less
        yellow or less yellowing alternative was found, landscapes, which
        generally have a lot of blue and white in them and which would have
        turned green and yellow respectively, may not have received a varnish
        coating.</p>

           id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> We have also seen the
        author-practitioner warn against the use of mastic in some cases because
        “it does not resist the rain” (fol. <a

    <p>We shall return to this last point later in the essay, but let us first
        discuss one more recipe in Ms. Fr. 640 that provides more details about
        the nature of mastic in painter’s varnish. The recipe in question, which
        can be found on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/97v"><span
                  class="underline">97v</span></a>, explains how to make “mastic
        varnish that dries within half an hour” (<em>Vernis de mastic sec en
            demye heure</em>).<a href="#fn20"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> To make this varnish you have to heat
        together turpentine “at your discretion,” “clear turpentine oil” and
        <em>eau de vye</em> (i.e., alcohol spirits, another volatile
        solvent)<em>.</em> As soon as these substances have become “very hot”
        one must add two ounces of “subtly ground mastic.” When all this has
        melted together, one should try the liquid on a knife and add turpentine
        oil when it has “too much body” (<em>trop de corps</em>), or add mastic
        resin when it is too thin. In a marginal note that appears on the same
        folio, the author of Ms. Fr. 640 describes how one can determine whether
        the varnish has the right consistency:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>One knows that this varnish does not have body enough when it does
            not take well on a panel in oil, for it is like water [<em>On
                cognoist que ce vernis nha point de corps asses quand il ne
                prend pas bien sur le tableau a huile car il est comme
                eau</em>].</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>This method of testing the viscosity of varnish on a knife is ancient,
        and can be found in some of the earliest recipe treatises that include
        varnish instructions.<a href="#fn21"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> It is clear that similar to the other
        solvent-based varnishes for easel paintings this recipe aims to produce
        a relatively thin varnish, using solvents such as turpentine oil and
        alcohol for dilution. Yet, some “body” is still required for the varnish
        to be usable because if it is too liquid, the varnish would “run off”
        the painting on application. In this case, the resin that gives
        viscosity or “body” to the varnish is mastic.</p>
    <p>Ms. Fr. 640 has a few important insights on how to prepare mastic to make
        it suitable for varnishing. The author-practitioner provides the reader
        with an elaborate description on how to procure the clearest mastic,
        which—similar to the other varnish ingredients—has to be “white &amp;
        purified of any dirt &amp; dust &amp; black dross” (<em>blanc &amp;
            purifie de toute terre &amp; poulsiere &amp; mache noire</em>). We
        learn that you either have to choose your mastic carefully or, to make
        it even better, you have to wash and dry it before using it in your
        varnish. The reason, so we learn, is that impurities contained within
        mastic resin will “remain within the varnish, &amp; when you set it on
        white or flesh colors, it will appear that they are fleas &amp;
        blemishes” (<em>demeureront aulx&nbsp;vernis&nbsp;&amp; co[mm]e tu
            lassoyras sur quelque blanc ou carnation il semblera que ce
            soient&nbsp;pulces&nbsp;&amp; taches</em>).</p>
    <p>Most mastic that can be purchased today is food-grade and therefore
        already relatively clean. Upon close inspection of some of the mastic
        tears however, we can see the small, dark impurities of which the
        author-practitioner of Ms. Fr. 640 writes (<i><span
                  class="underline">Fig. 7</span></i>). As soon as the resin
        dissolves, these impurities would indeed have ended up in the varnish
        liquid. Applied to a painting they may have shown up as small black
        specks on the lighter parts of the work, or, in the words of the
        author-practitioner of Ms. Fr. 640, appear like “fleas.”<a href="#fn22"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Mastic is not soluble in water, but it
        does swell up when immersed in it. Soaking the resin may therefore have
        helped release some of the impurities at its surface.</p>

    <p>After this detailed explanation of how to clean the mastic, the varnish
        recipe continues that the mastic resin has to be pulverized very finely
        and passed through a sieve. We learn that the finest selection of tears
        of purified mastic are particularly suited for “small works” (<em>petits
            ouvrages</em>). Certainly, on the lighter parts of smaller
        paintings—typically observed from up close—impurities in the varnish
        would have indeed been most visible and intrusive. Various marginal
        notes on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/97v"><span
                  class="underline">97v</span></a> explain that this particular
        varnish “almost dries when working” (<em>Il deseiche presque en
            travaillant</em>), has to be “laid down cold on the panel with a
        very clean finger tip, &amp; one needs to spread it vigorously” (<em>Ce
            vernis se pose a froid sur le tableau avelcq le bout du doigt bien
            net &amp; le fault estendre bien vivementand</em>). And similar to

                  class="underline">3r</span></a> discussed above, we are again
        reminded that the varnish “has to be laid on thin,” because “when thick,
        it yellows” (<em>On couche le vernis avecq le doigt affin de le coucher

        640 and the Marciana Manuscript on Painter’s Varnish</h2>
    <p>Other recipe treatises contemporary to Ms. Fr. 640 similarly suggest that
        mastic had become an important ingredient in painter’s varnishes by the
        end of the sixteenth century. We will first discuss an Italian
        manuscript that bears the title <em>Segreti d’arti diverse</em> but is
        better known as the Marciana manuscript (Venice, Biblioteca Marciana, MS
        It. III.10). Mary Philadelphia Merrifield, who edited the Marciana
        recipes as part of her <em>Original Treatises</em> (1849), dates the
        manuscript to the first quarter of the sixteenth century, but in their
        more recent edition Fabio Frezzato and Claudio Seccaroni place it in the
        second half of the sixteenth century, close to when Ms. Fr. 640 was
        compiled.<a href="#fn24"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> The Marciana manuscript contains
        twelve varnish recipes, including recipes for solvent-based varnishes
        that have no precedent in earlier compilations and treatises. But of
        these twelve varnish recipes in the Marciana manuscript, only one
        specifies that it is used to varnish oil paintings: “A most excellent
        clear and drying varnish proper for colors, both in oil-painting and in
        other kinds of painting” (<em>vernice ottima chiara et diseccativa ben
            per colori et a olio et per ogni dipintura</em>)<em>.</em><a
           href="#fn25"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> Similar to Ms. Fr. 640, the recipe
        recommends taking the best and clearest ingredients: two parts “clear
        and good nut oil” (<em>dolio di noce chiaro et bello</em>), one part
        “clear and good Greek pitch” (<em>pece greca chiara et bella</em>). and
        one part “clear and good mastic” (<em>mastice chiaro et bello</em>). One
        first separately grinds the Greek pitch and the mastic to a fine powder.
        Then, when the walnut oil has been cooked “until one-third has
        evaporated” (<em>tanto che scemi el terzo</em>), one puts in powdered
        Greek pitch “a little at a time.”</p>
    <p>Ms. Fr. 640 includes a detailed explanation of what the appellation
        <em>pece greca</em> in this recipe most likely referred to. In a recipe
        on fol. <a

                  class="underline">3v</span></a> the author-practitioner
        explains that <em>pix græca</em> is also known as “colophony”
        (<em>colophoine</em>), and that this is the solid residue which remains
        when distilling “turpentine” (<em>tourmentine</em>) to make “turpentine
        oil” (<em>dhuile de tourmentine</em>). The author-practitioner even
        includes a drawing of an alembic to show what apparatus is used in the
        distilling of turpentine (<i><span class="underline">Fig.
                8</span></i>).<a href="#fn26"

    <p>The varnish recipe in the Marciana manuscript continues by warning that
        only when your Greek pitch has been fully incorporated into the nut oil,
        powdered mastic can be added in the same manner. As soon as all of this
        has dissolved, you take the varnish from the fire and “strain it through
        a fine and old linen cloth.” Having thus carefully prepared the varnish
        with the clearest of ingredients, you can further improve its clarity by
        cleaning and selecting your mastic and by cleaning your varnish with
        alum:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>If you wish your varnish to be still clearer, prepare the mastic with
            tepid water in the following manner: Take the largest and clearest
            tears of mastic [<em>grani del mastice più grossi et chiari</em>]
            you can find and soak them in tepid water so that they become
            tender; then select the best pieces, dry them, and pound them.</p>
        <p>You may also try the effect of adding a little burned and pulverized
            rock alum [<em>allume di roccha arso polverizzato</em>] when the
            other ingredients are dissolved, so that the whole may virtually be
            seasoned with it, straining it afterward. This is done to purify it
            better [<em>Questo si fa per farla più purgata</em>]. <a
               href="#fn27"
               class="footnote-ref"
               id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Alum, we have seen, is also mentioned in Ms. Fr. 640 and in the <em>Liber
            illuministarum</em>, composed a few decades earlier, but the
        Marciana manuscript appears to detail for the first time its supposed
        role in removing impurities in oil-resin varnishes. More interesting in
        relation to Ms. Fr. 640 are of course the Marciana manuscript’s
        instructions on how to clean mastic resin in tepid water. These
        instructions cannot be found in earlier treatises and are congruent with
        other recent developments in the making of painter’s varnish, seeking
        only the clearest and cleanest materials.</p>

        Ms. Fr. 640 and Armenini’s Account of Varnishing in Sixteenth-Century
        Italy</h2>
    <p>The emphasis on purity is further supported by similar references to
        white and lustrous mastic found in a treatise by the Italian writer and
        painter Giovanni Battista Armenini (1533–1609). More clearly embedded in
        the context of easel painting than the Marciana manuscript, <em>De’ veri
            precetti della pittura</em> (<em>On the True Precepts of the Art of
            Painting</em>, 1586), dedicated to “beginners, to scholars, and to
        lovers of fine arts” (<em>i principianti, a gli studiosi, et alli
            amatori delle belle arti</em>), includes several recipes for making
        painter’s varnish and pertinent observations about the state of the art
        of varnishing easel paintings in Italy.<a href="#fn28"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> As in the recipes discussed thus far,
        the first painter’s varnish Armenini includes is made from the clearest
        of materials: “white, lustrous mastic” (<em>mastice che sia bianco,
            &amp; lustro</em>) and “clear oil of walnut” (<em>oglio di noce
            chiaro</em>).<a href="#fn29"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> Armenini observes that a little fine
        dust of alum is used to improve clarity when it is boiled with the
        varnish (<em>più lustra se vi si getta che bolle un poco di allume di
            roccha abbrugiato</em>). He also explains that besides its use as a
        coating for paintings, this varnish can be used with some colors, such
        as blues and lakes, and “will make them dry faster.” Ms. Fr. 640
        contains similar remarks about using varnish as a binder for certain
        pigments, likely to prevent a change in hue from mixing them with drying
        oils alone. On fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/58r"><span
                  class="underline">58r</span></a>, for instance, continued from
        a longer section entitled “Painter (<em>painctre,</em> fols. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/57v"><span
                  class="underline">58v</span></a>-67r),” the
        author-practitioner mentions using spike lavender oil mixed with a
        little walnut oil as a binder for lead white. This is something he does
        not recommend for lake pigments and other “colors without body,” but for
        colors “that have body &amp; are somewhat fatty” (such as lead white),
        he considers it “quite appropriate” (<em>bien propre</em>).<a
           href="#fn30"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> On several occasions, most likely to
        prevent the negative effects of a yellowing binder, he mentions
        turpentine oil as a suitable binder for a blue pigment called

           id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
    <p>Like the author-practitioner of Ms. Fr. 640, Armenini believed that “the
        thinnest and most lustrous” (<em>la più sutile, e più lustra</em>)
        painter’s varnish had to be made <em>without</em> drying oils.<a
           href="#fn32"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> To make this solvent-based varnish,
        Armenini explains that painters melted <em>oglio d’abezzo chiaro</em> in
        a little pot over a “slow fire” (<em>lento fuoco</em>). When this had
        thoroughly liquefied, an equal quantity of <em>oglio di sasso</em> was
        added. <em>Oglio di abezzo</em> refers to a turpentine oleoresin and may
        be the same as Strasbourg turpentine (resin from fir). The appellation
        <em>oglio di sasso</em> refers to the crude oil, also known as
        petroleum, found beneath the earth’s surface—such as the famous oil of
        Modena in the seventeenth century—which in some places can be found
        seeping from the earth.<a href="#fn33"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> Sometimes the volatile component in
        such oils is so high that they might be a natural distillate. Petroleum
        had been found in Europe since the Middle Ages and was used for lighting
        and for medicinal purposes, and, since the sixteenth century, had been
        used to thin varnishes, similar to oil of turpentine. Armenini explains
        that the mixture of <em>oglio d’abezzo</em> and <em>oglio di sasso</em>
        is blended by hand while it is still warm and then spread uniformly over
        the work, which has previously been heated in the sun (<em>mesticanodo
            con la mano così caldo stendevano sopra il lavoro prima posto al
            Sole</em>). He greatly admires the skill necessary to varnish a
        painting by what he considers a traditional method: “I have seen it used
        in this manner by the most skillful artists throughout all of Lombardy,
        and I was told that Correggio and Parmigianino used this type of varnish
        in their works, if one believes their disciples.”<a href="#fn34"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
    <p>Ms. Fr. 640 also contains a recipe that appears to be a combination of
        Armenini’s petroleum-based varnish discussed above and the mastic
        oil-resin varnishes found both in Armenini’s treatise and in the
        Marciana manuscript.<a href="#fn35"

        varnish” (<em>Aultre vernys aprouve</em>), describes a varnish made with
        linseed oil, petroleum (<em>dhuille petrolle</em>), “mastic, the whitest
        you can find,” alum, and copperas (likely sulphate of zinc, intended to
        act as a dryer in the varnish). Essentially, it is an oil-resin varnish
        with reduced viscosity due to the petroleum. It is not clear from the
        context in Ms. Fr. 640 what the specific use of this varnish would have
        been. But in the Marciana manuscript and in Armenini’s treatise, similar
        oil-resin varnishes are recommended for coating oil paintings. What
        makes Ms. Fr. 640 stand out is that in all instances where the
        author-practitioner is explicit about what varnish to use for this
        purpose (and which varnishes not), the use of oil-based varnishes is not
        just discouraged but considered something “of the past.” I will end this
        section with a rather remarkable comment by Armenini about the practice
        of varnishing in his day because it resonates with this view in Ms. Fr.
        640. Armenini considers the practice of varnishing easel paintings a
        tradition almost lost to his own time:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Very few pay attention to varnishes in our times, perhaps more
            through avarice and neglect than for good reasons. Nevertheless,
            since varnishes are necessary, we shall discuss how they were made
            and used by the best craftsmen who are no longer with us.<a
               href="#fn36"
               class="footnote-ref"
               id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>The author-practitioner of Ms. Fr. 640
        observes something similar about Italian varnishing practice—or rather
        the lack thereof on fol. 97v: “The Italians scarcely varnish their
        paintings because they lay their paintings very thick &amp; they are a
        long time drying on the inside, though on top they make a dry skin &amp;
        crust” (<em>Les Italiens ne vernissent gueres leur painctures pource
            quilz couchent leurs painctures fort Espesses &amp; ne sont de long
            temps seiches au dedans bien que dessus elle fassent une peau &amp;
            croste seiche</em>). Whether or not there is a connection between
        Armenini’s observation that the art of varnishing is no longer practiced
        in Italy and the author practitioner’s technical explanation for
        omitting this final surface coating on thickly layered Italian paintings
        needs more research, but it is certainly interesting that these remarks
        appear exactly during a time when oil painting had undergone some
        dramatic changes, shifting from the many fine and detailed layers that
        characterize most easel paintings in the fifteenth century, to the
        bolder painting techniques made popular by painters such as Titian and
        Tintoretto. A shift that is moreover characterized by painters working
        in this bold style often using canvas as the support of choice for their
        paintings, rather than the wooden panels that were more popular in the
        fifteenth century.</p>
    <p>These similarities between the recipes in Ms. Fr. 640, the Marciana
        manuscript, and Armenini’s treatise all embed the varnishing practice
        they document in late-sixteenth century painting techniques. As many of
        the recipes for varnish contained in these treatises first appear in the
        last decades of the sixteenth century, these resonances suggest that the
        art of varnishing oil paintings had undergone significant changes in
        this period. What makes Ms. Fr. 640 stand out is that it completely does
        away with drying oils for making varnish for paintings and various other
        objects, including even, as we have seen, floorboards. In its recipes
        for varnishing paintings, drying oils are always replaced with
        turpentine oil or wine spirits. And, what is more, the
        author-practitioner does not take this for granted; he comments on the
        reasons for choosing a solvent-based varnish over an oil-based varnish
        on several occasions. The advantages of solvent-based varnishes
        according to Ms. Fr. 640, is that they dry faster during all times of
        the day and in all seasons; they do not have to be cooked vigorously (if
        at all) thus keeping the substance of a relatively light color; they are
        thin enough to be easily applied without requiring the straining heat of
        the sun; and their relatively low viscosity allows them to be applied
        thinly. As a result, solvent-based varnishes have “solved” the problem
        of green skies, yellowed whites, or other issues with a painted surface
        yellowing over time due to using an oil-based varnish. In fact, this new
        type of varnish could even solve the problem of older paintings
        suffering from a varnish that had become yellowed. In a recipe on fol.
        <a href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/4r"><span
                  class="underline">4r</span></a> “for removing varnish from an
        old panel that is yellowish &amp; varnishing it anew,” we learn how to
        remove varnish with “white soap &amp; sieved ashes,” both soaked in hot
        water, by sponging this mixture over the painting and rubbing “the panel
        with them.” When this is done, you “throw a bucket of water against the
        panel to clean it.” The panel is then “put a quarter of an hour in the
        sun to make it dry and to revive the colors.” This last act is
        particularly interesting as it likely helped brighten the linseed or
        walnut oil component of the paint, which is known to bleach when exposed
        to sunlight; a reversible process not fully understood by chemistry
        today (in the dark, the oil will turn yellow again).<a href="#fn37"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> Once the painting has been cleaned and
        brightened this way “you can spread your turpentine varnish on it.”
        Significantly, here too, a solvent-based turpentine varnish is
        recommended for varnishing an older painting after cleaning it.</p>
    <h2 id="ms.-fr.-640-and-sloane-ms-2052">Ms. Fr. 640 and Sloane MS 2052</h2>
    <p>We have now studied several technical treatises contemporary to Ms. Fr.
        640, thus establishing that the nature of varnishing practice and the
        changes in the art of varnishing easel paintings indicated by the
        author-practitioner were part of a larger development that took place in
        the sixteenth century. An important later source showing that such
        explorations continued in the seventeenth century is a recipe collection
        compiled between 1620 and 1646 by the physician to King James I and King
        Charles I, Sir Theodore Turquet de Mayerne (1573–1655).<a href="#fn38"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> Among the many manuscripts Mayerne
        left behind, many dealing with different aspects of medical practice,
        Sloane MS 2052 (London, British Library) is perhaps best known today. It
        records numerous recipes and experiments based on conversations Mayerne
        had with painters and other artisans of his day, making it an invaluable
        resource for studying the materials and techniques of
        seventeenth-century painting. Its recipes for varnish are many and
        various, but here I single out several instructions for making painter’s
        varnish that suggest that the materials and methods first described in
        the sixteenth century appear to have become common practice during the
        first decades of the seventeenth century.</p>
    <p>Mayerne includes a more general discussion about the desirable properties
        of varnish (<em>Discours sur les vernix</em>):</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Varnishes to be good should be desiccating, clear, transparent, and
            as little colored as possible [<em>Les vernix pour estre bons
                doyuent estre fort siccatifs, clairs &amp; transparents, &amp;
                le moings colorés que faire se peult</em>]. Water should not
            attack them, they should neither peel nor crack and be washable
            without turning whitish or dark, and should, if they become darker
            with time, be restorable again with the same simple oils with which
            they were made.<a href="#fn39"
               class="footnote-ref"
               id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>In its concern that varnishes be as
        colorless as possible to their being resistant to cracking, humidity,
        and washing, the above is entirely in line with the concerns of the
        author-practitioner of Ms. Fr. 640 in making painter’s varnish. Mayerne
        continues the discourse on varnish by explaining that when varnishes are
        “compounded” they are made from “certain resin drops” (<em>certaines
            larmes resineuses</em>) dissolved in particular oils. We learn that
        the oils suitable for dissolving resin are nut oil and linseed oil which
        are “resistant to every liquid” and “the varnishes are more beautiful
        and have more body” (<em>seront plus beaus &amp; auront plus de
            corps</em>). Further down in the same passage, Mayerne mentions that
        the “most commonly used oils for fine varnishes” (<em>Les plus
            ordinaires pour les vernix delicats)</em> are turpentine oil,
        spikenard oil, and naphtha with turpentine itself” (<em>les huyles de
            Therebentine, d’aspic, &amp; le petrole auec la Therebentine
            mesme).</em><a href="#fn40"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> Mayerne therefore mentions the same
        materials that feature in Ms. Fr. 640, however it appears that, in
        contrast to Ms. Fr. 640, Mayerne still considers drying oils appropriate
        for making painter’s varnish as well.</p>
    <p>Mayerne’s discourse about varnish set out in this passage is congruent
        with the recipes for varnish that he includes in his manuscript. Sloane
        MS 2052 contains numerous recipes for different types of varnish, many
        of which appear to have been used by painters in the past or were
        obtained from practicing painters by Mayerne himself. We will here focus
        on the recipes that Mayerne singles out for producing particularly good
        painter’s varnishes. The first recipe of interest explains how to make
        an “Incomparable varnish” (<em>vernix incomparable</em>) with “very
        clear Venetian turpentine” and “light oil of turpentine.” It is
        remarkably similar to the painter’s varnish described on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/3r"><span
                  class="underline">3r</span></a> of Ms. Fr. 640:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Incomparable varnish
            <br>
            Rp. Place very clear [<em>tresclaire</em>] Venetian turpentine and
            light oil of turpentine [<em>huile de Thereb. blanc</em>], in equal
            parts, in a Vessel over a low fire, and when you see bubbles forming
            around the edge remove it quickly from the flame since the Varnish
            will burn spontaneously. Let it cool and store in a bottle. This
            varnish can be applied to all paints, especially to verdigris, to
            flesh tones and all others. It preserves all colors; they will not
            fade and will not be altered by the air [<em>Il conserve toutes
                couleurs, qui ne meurent jamais, ne pouvant estre altérées de
                l’air</em>]. It dries in three hours and the advantage is that
            it can be worked and painted on afterwards. <a href="#fn41"
               class="footnote-ref"
               id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a>
        </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>In addition to its drying speed and using
        the same materials and method of preparation as Ms. Fr. 640, this recipe
        also emphasizes—again similar to the recipes discussed above—using the
        clearest and lightest of ingredients so the varnish is particularly
        suitable for verdigris and flesh tones. The claim for the durability
        that this varnish will give to the painting is more specific than what
        we have seen thus far, as this “incomparable varnish” should protect the
        colors of a painting against fading and protect the work from the
        effects of “air.”</p>
    <p>Another varnish recipe, to which Mayerne adds the marginal note “I have
        seen it. Superb” (<em>vidi optimum</em>), also presents several striking
        similarities to the recipes contained in Ms. Fr. 640. The recipe in
        question explains how to make the “very good varnish of Mr. Adam” which
        is “light as water and drying in three hours” (<em>clair comme eau,
            &amp; siccatif en trois heures</em>).<a href="#fn42"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> The varnish is made with “very clear
        Venetian turpentine” (<em>therebentine de Venize fort claire</em>)
        heated on a small stove in a water bath before it is mixed with “well
        cleaned mastic grains crushed to powder” (<em>mastich en larme bien
            purgé, mis en poudre subtille</em>) until the resin is melted. In
        another vessel “very light and clear oil of turpentine” (<em>d’huile de
            therebentine blanche &amp; tresclaire</em>) is heated in a closed
        vessel (also in a water bath) before it is poured over the “turpentine
        with the melted mastic in it.” To apply this varnish “the very clean
        picture is placed in the sun until it is warmed, then the varnish is
        applied warm and allowed to dry.” Down to the “well-cleaned grains of
        mastic,” this recipe for an allegedly “<em>optimum</em>” varnish is
        similar to the recipes included in the Marciana manuscript, Ms. Fr. 640,
        and the treatise of Armenini. In contrast to Ms. Fr. 640 is the
        recommendation to varnish in the sun, something the author-practitioner
        explicitly recommends against for fear of straining your panel too much.
        As early as the first decades of the fifteenth century, recipe authors
        had similarly started cautioning against varnishing in the sun. Cennino
        Cennini for instance wrote that “if you want to have the varnish dry
        without the sun, cook it thoroughly in the first place; for the panel
        will be very well off not to be strained by the sun too severely.”<a
           href="#fn43"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> The author-practitioner of Ms. Fr. 640
        also warns against this practice when he observes in a marginal note on
        fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/3v/f/3v/tc"><span
                  class="underline">3v</span></a> that “it is better to heat the
        varnish a little bit, rather than to put it out in the sun, because this
        makes the panel warp” (<em>Il est mieulx de chaufer un peu le vernis que
            le coucher au soleil pourceque cela faict enveler le tableau</em>).
    </p>
    <p>It is possible, however, that due to the increasing popularity of using
        canvas as a support for oil paintings during Mayerne’s time—he mentions
        the use of canvas for this purpose in numerous recipes—the fear of
        putting strain on your painting by varnishing in the sun had become less
        relevant than when panels were predominantly in use. Unlike wooden
        panels, which were typically made from different planks glued together,
        and therefore susceptible to being strained by the sun’s heat, a
        painting on canvas did not have this problem.<a href="#fn44"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> As a result, concerns about straining
        your painting too much in the sun might have become irrelevant for easel
        paintings made on this support. The sun’s heat, on the other hand, does
        positively influence the working properties of varnish upon application
        in terms of viscosity and curing time. This might have led to the
        reintroduction of varnishing outside for easel paintings on supports not
        susceptible to being exposed to the sun.
      <p>Several more recipes for painter’s varnish in Mayerne’s manuscript show
        that the search for the clearest of solvent-based varnishes had become
        the standard for varnishing easel paintings at the time. I will here
        limit the discussion to an instruction for making varnish, entitled
        “Excellent varnish” (<em>vernix excellent</em>), because it states that
        the recipe is for a “common painting varnish” (<em>le vernix commun des
            peintres)</em> and it is particularly concerned with the viscosity
        of the substance.<a href="#fn45"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> The varnish is made with “very light
        or the least yellow Venetian turpentine you can possibly find”
        (<em>Therebentine de Venise tresblanche ou au moings la moings jaulne
            que pourrés trouver</em>) and with “oil of turpentine that has been
        redistilled or the first time is purified with water to improve it”
        (<em>l’huile blanche de Therebentine redistillée pour mieux faire, ou
            tirée la première fois avec eau</em>). We learn that this
        purification of oil of turpentine should happen in a sand bath “without
        prolonged evaporation of the vapors [of the solvent, i.e., the
        turpentine oil] for fear that it may thicken.” Once again, as with the
        sixteenth-century recipes discussed previously, the varnish for easel
        paintings is not allowed to be too viscous because it was believed this
        may cause it to yellow and therefore negatively impact the colors of the
        painted surface underneath.<a href="#fn46"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> Interestingly, the previous
        solvent-based varnish is not yet ready for use. Unlike the solvent-based
        painter’s varnishes in Ms. Fr. 640, the solvent-based varnish in
        Mayerne’s manuscript has to be mixed with “light and drying linseed oil
        or walnut oil” (<em>l’huyle blanche &amp; siccative de lin ou de
            noix</em>) before it is applied thinly while warm.
    </p>
    <p>Another important difference between Mayerne’s manuscript and Ms. Fr.
        640, concerns their attitude towards using spike lavender as an
        ingredient in varnishes for oil paintings. We have seen that in his
        recipe for imitating the polished shine of ebony, the
        author-practitioner of Ms. Fr. 640 recommends using a varnish made with
        essential oils of <em>lavandula latifiola</em>. For the varnishing of
        paintings, however, he considers this ingredient unsuitable because it
        is too “biting.” Mayerne, on the other hand, frequently mentions spike
        lavender oil as an ingredient for painter’s varnishes. One of these
        recipes, entitled “good varnish” explains how to make “the best varnish
        for oil painting” with spike lavender oil, Venetian turpentine, and the
        “the best and most costly mastic.” Despite it allegedly being “the best
        varnish for oil painting,” the recipe nevertheless concludes with the
        remark that “the less varnish used the better because it makes the
        pictures crack.”<a href="#fn47"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a></p>
    <p>Apart from these small variations between Mayerne and Ms. Fr. 640, the
        similarities are striking. In addition to using solvents such as
        turpentine oil to make varnish and the fact that both manuscripts stress
        using the clearest of ingredients, another important common denominator
        is that both recipe collections indicate that mastic has become the most
        important resin for making painter’s varnish. Compared to other resins,
        mastic is relatively white, especially, as we have seen, when the best
        tears are selected and cleaned. Mastic is easily incorporated in
        different solvents at low to no heat, helping the varnish mixture itself
        stay light as well. But mastic was not perfect for all purposes. Because
        mastic resin reacts to moisture—a fact which we have seen also helped
        clean it—it is prone to “blooming,” meaning that the varnish may develop
        a cloudy, whitish surface. Mastic varnishes, therefore, do not resist
        humidity well. This fact is noted on various occasions by the author of
        Ms. Fr. 640, also in relation to solvent-based varnishes more generally.
        A rainproof varnish, we learn, should instead be made from a drying oil
        and <em>rousine</em>: “Mastic varnish does not resist rain, whereas that
        of oil and <em>rousine</em> does (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/3r"><span
                  class="underline">3r</span></a>).” A recipe for such a
        rainproof varnish—<em>Vernis&nbsp;durant a leau</em>—is provided on fol.
        <a href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/31r"><span
                  class="underline">31r</span></a>. After the
        author-practitioner has repeated his claim that “Flanders varnish made
        with turpentine &amp; oil from this or from mastic, can come off and
        does not hold up in the rain,” we learn that varnish made with “white
        walnut oil” (<em>huile de noix blanche</em>):</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>holds in the rain [and] is very clear &amp; beautiful &amp; dries
            soon [<em>fais tient a la pluye t est fort cler &amp; beau &amp;
                bien tost sec</em>]. This is why one uses this one for painted
            banners &amp; signs that one carries in the rain.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>This concern with mastic varnish applied
        to objects placed in humid to wet environments was also recorded by
        Mayerne in a recipe for “Waterproof varnish” (<em>vernix resistant a
            l’eaue</em>) taken from a certain M. Portsmann:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><em>M. Portsmann,</em> Flemish painter believes that all varnishes,
            like Mastic, Sandarac or other gum resins which do not stand water
            without turning white and spoiling [<em>qui ne peuvent souffrir
                l’eau sans blanchir &amp; se gaster</em>], can nevertheless be
            used without drawbacks, if a little greasy oil that has been
            bleached in the sun as said above is added to the varnish. This is
            dissolved and made fluid with spikenard oil which evaporates easily,
            so that the oil conserves everything remaining [<em>conservera tout
                le resete</em>].<a href="#fn48"
               class="footnote-ref"
               id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>In a marginal note to a recipe for making
        a solvent-based varnish, Mayerne explains how the addition of oil helps
        such a varnish make the object more resistant to air and water:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>To all common varnishes add a little nut oil or sun-bleached linseed
            oil; this prevents tearing and makes it resistant to air and water

    <p>These last recipes may explain why drying oils remained popular
        ingredients for mixing with solvent-based varnishes: drying oils help
        create an incredibly strong coating, much stronger than when using a
        varnish based on (oleo)resin and volatile oils alone. Mayerne’s
        manuscript suggests that it was thought that experimenting with
        combining these substances could give varnishes the best of both worlds.
        It is therefore interesting that while the role of drying oils in making
        varnishes waterproof was certainly known to the author-practitioner of
        Ms. Fr. 640, he somehow did not consider this a reason for using it on
        easel paintings that were going to hang indoors. Indeed, in Ms. Fr. 640,
        the precious medieval oil-resin varnish appears to have been relegated
        to the realm of temporary festive decorations and banners, printing ink,
        and the coating of metals.</p>
    <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>In the course of the seventeenth century varnishing practice increases in
        complexity, especially as new continents come into view and new
        materials and methods for varnishing are introduced to European
        artisans. Attempts at imitating East Asian lacquerware for instance
        spurred a new passion for varnish as a coating for a wide variety of
        objects, from small and precious boxes to intricate pieces of
        furniture.<a href="#fn50"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> This is demonstrated by the surviving
        material culture from this period and the numerous treatises filled with
        recipes for a wide variety of different varnishes. But unlike the
        varnishes for easel paintings discussed in this essay, the coatings for
        Asian lacquerware and its European imitations were explored for their
        own artistic merit. Indeed, these varnishes were not meant to disappear
        at the surface of the object they covered. On the contrary, they
        <em>make up the surface of the object</em> and are an integral part of
        its aesthetic. Used to imitate gold, gems, and enamel, this is not so
        different from how varnish was explored and used by medieval artisans.
        These layers were similarly fundamental to the visual appearance of the
        medieval work of art.</p>
    <p>This, indeed, is what had changed in varnishing practice since the
        fifteenth century and which is documented in unique detail in Ms. Fr.
        640. Since the time of Van Eyck and his contemporaries, the ambition of
        the painter had changed from material mimesis to the mimesis of the
        visible world. Recipe collections show that varnishes were developed to
        suit this new ambition. It was no longer acceptable for varnishes to be
        so bright and shining so as to hide what was underneath by their
        reflection, or to change the colors of the paint surface they were meant
        to cover—turning blue skies green and making whites yellow. In their
        application on easel paintings, varnishes had become subservient to what
        was underneath: they had to bring out colors and unify the appearance of
        the painted surface, and, most of all, protect and make paintings more
        durable and more lasting.</p>
    <p>Almost ironically, these properties of varnish made the varnish itself
        less durable on art objects, and especially on paintings. As soon as
        varnishes no longer fulfilled their function, they were (and are)
        removed and replaced by a new varnish. This is certainly unimaginable
        with a piece of East Asian lacquerware, or a medieval panel covered in
        colored varnish to imitate gold, gems, and enamel. Removing such a
        varnish would essentially mean <em>remaking</em> the entire artwork.
        This is why we know so little about historical varnishes for easel
        paintings. Since material evidence is scant, we have to turn to recipes
        to gain a better understanding of the nature and optics of this
        historical layer on easel paintings. With its many unique and detailed
        observations about the materials and making of varnish which are clearly
        embedded in contemporary <em>and</em> historical artisanal practice, the
        value of Ms. Fr. 640 for our understanding of the varnishing of easel
        paintings in the sixteenth century cannot be overestimated.</p>

                    an almost honey-like consistency upon application).<a
