        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <div>
            <p>This essay explains and reconstructs the method of casting medals
                as described on fols. <a
                   href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/83v/f/83v/tl"><u>83v</u></a>
                and <a
                   href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/92r/f/92r/tl"><u>92r</u></a>.
                This type of medal, which is cast with a convex relief on the
                obverse and an exact concave negative of the relief on the
                reverse, was widespread throughout Europe by the late sixteenth
                century. Modern scholars frequently refer to these medals as
                “without reverse,” “hollow cast,” “incuse-reverse cast,” or
                “uniface.” Little is known about the methods of their
                production. Ms. Fr. 640 presents at least one entry describing a
                previously unknown method for casting this type of medal. This
                essay sheds new light on their facture, and discusses their
                broader significance within Ms. Fr. 640 and in other
                contemporary sources.</p>

        of BnF Ms. Fr. 640, the recipe “Molding hollow on one side and in relief
        on the other” gives advice on how to cast a thin medal with a convex
        relief on the obverse and an exact concave negative of the relief image
        on the reverse (<i><u>Fig. 1</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 2</u></i>, <i><u>Fig.
                3</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 4</u></i>). Modern scholars frequently
        refer to these medals as “without reverse,” “hollow cast,”
        “incuse-reverse cast,” or “uniface.”<a href="#fn1"

        originated suggest that the manufacture of these objects was a
        well-established practice throughout Europe by the late sixteenth
        century, however, little is known about their purpose, reception, and
        the methods by which they were produced. They are sometimes held to be
        incomplete because they often lack mottoes and emblems on the reverse,
        or they are thought to have had more practical uses than simply as
        decorative or collectible objects, and are sometimes even seen as
        potential molds, whereby the reverse could be used as a matrix.<a

    <p>The purpose of this essay is twofold: first, to explain the method of
        what we will henceforth call the “hollow-relief” medal casting as
        described on fol. 92r, and, second, to examine it both within the
        context of other medal casting processes described in Ms. Fr. 640, and
        in other contemporary sources. Ms. Fr. 640 contains several recipes that
        can be connected with the hollow-relief process on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/92r/f/92r/tl"><u>92r</u></a>,
        either in the technique, the outcome of the process, or the terminology
        used.<a href="#fn4"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref4"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> That said, the terminology used
        in Ms. Fr. 640 to indicate or describe hollow-relief medals and their
        manufacture is not wholly consistent, and it overlaps with related
        processes such as making hollow molds and casting with a core. Our
        investigation of the broader context of the technique described on fol.
        92r included material evidence found in extant medals, as well as a
        search for other early modern written accounts of this process. Although
        neither our experiments nor our research on the context of this recipe
        have been exhaustive, interesting findings and conclusions can still be
        drawn.</p>
    <h2 id="the-recipe">The Recipe</h2>
    <p>As in many entries in Ms. Fr. 640, the one on <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/92r/f/92r/tl"><u>92r</u></a>
        goes into detail regarding certain aspects of the process it describes,
        without explaining the entire method from beginning to end:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>
            <strong>Molding hollow on one side and in relief on the other
            </strong>
        </p>
        <p>And for this effect, one casts a medal of fine tin, which is harder
            to melt. And since it is neat, one molds with it. And one leaves it
            in one half of the frame &amp; presses it a little so that it holds
            better. And next, you will cast in your frame some solder described
            above, or another more meltable than fine tin. And thus, the second
            medal will melt &amp; mold itself on the first one without spoiling
            it. But to make sure this is done right, mix some lamp black with
            water &amp;, with a paintbrush, give a light coat of this to the
            medal, which remains in the frame, &amp; leave to dry. Thus it will
            not melt.</p>
        <p>But if you have a medal of copper or silver, you can leave it in the
            cast if you want to cast with lead or tin. But it is necessary that
            it be a little hot, for the cold would make the tin contract.</p>
        <p>Tin wants to be cast quite hot to come out neat.</p>
        <p>
            <strong>Soft tin</strong>, which is the best for the cast, is the
            one that, once cast in grille, is <del>burnished &amp;</del> shiny
            &amp; polished like a mirror, &amp; appears to have been burnished.
            And does not have holes like the one that is brittle &amp; that is
            not shiny as if burnished (fol. <a
               href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/92r/f/92r/tl"><u>92r</u></a>).
        </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>The focus here is on making sure that the
        original model, i.e., the medal that is to be reproduced, is suitable
        for the process. The author-practitioner touches upon its material, use,
        and treatment, and suggests starting with a medal made from pure tin
        (<em>estain fin</em>)<a href="#fn5"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref5"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> that is neat, or, in other words,
        containing sharp enough detail to be used as a pattern. The metal used
        for casting is called <em>souldure</em> (solder), as “described above”
        in “Mixture easy to melt” (also fol. 92r), that is of a lower melting
        point than pure tin. In a second paragraph he notes that “if you have a
        medal of copper or silver, you can leave it in the cast, if you want to
        cast with lead or tin.” The author-practitioner’s point in discussing
        these different types of metals is that, not only must the original
        medal create a sharp impression (i.e., “neat”) when used as the pattern,
        but that it must also be made of a metal with a higher melting point
        than the metal used for casting.<a href="#fn6"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref6"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
    <p>With regard to the method of casting, the recipe provides the following
        clues: “And one leaves it in one half of the frame, &amp; presses it a
        little so that it holds better. And next, you will cast in your frame
        some solder described above, or another more meltable than fine tin. And
        thus, the second medal will melt &amp; mold itself on the first one
        without spoiling it.” Further on, he reiterates, “you can leave it in
        the cast.” Thus, the original medal is not only used to imprint the
        mold, but it actually becomes part of the mold. This explains the
        importance of the different melting points of the original medal and the
        metal used for casting.</p>
    <p>Another important factor to the caster was the protection of the original
        medal. If the medal was deemed worthy of reproducing, it can be assumed
        that it would be preferable not to damage it during the reproduction
        process. Keeping it intact would also offer the possibility for
        continuous reproduction. The higher melting point of the metal used for
        the original prevents it from melting during the process. And the
        author-practitioner offers more advice for further protection: “mix some
        lamp black with water, &amp;, with a paintbrush, give a light coat of
        this to the medal, which remains in the frame, &amp; leave to dry. Thus
        it will not melt.” The layer of lamp black appears to function not only
        as a separator but also as a protective layer for the surface of the
        original medal, which was to be left in the mold during the casting.</p>
    <h2 id="experiments">Experiments</h2>
    <p>After reading this recipe closely, it became clear to us that the
        original medal was to be used as a part of the mold, as explained above,
        but it was not at all clear what exactly the technique was. We
        hypothesized that it would only make sense to leave the medal in the
        upper, or male half of the flask, after making a negative imprint with
        it in the bottom, or female half. Pressing the obverse (the front) of
        the original medal all the way into the female half and pressing the
        reverse of the original firmly into the male half would ensure
        sufficient space between them for the molten metal to enter. Variations
        on how deeply the medal would be pressed into the sand on either side
        would allow for results of various thicknesses.</p>
    <p>Patricia Tuttle proposes a model for the manufacture of hollow-relief
        medals in which the original medal is first used to make an impression
        in the sand in the female flask and is then taken out (<i><u>Fig. 5</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 6</u></i>). After drying this female half of the mold (<i><u>Fig. 7</u></i>), the male flask is filled by fitting it over the
        female flask (<i><u>Fig. 8</u></i>). After the application of a
        separating agent between the male and female halves, such as fine ash,
        it is filled with sand, thus creating a positive imprint of the same
        medal. Again, this half is also left to dry. To create a thin cavity
        between the two halves into which the molten metal could be poured,
        Tuttle suggests the use of a shim whose thickness would be that of the
        desired medal (<i><u>Fig. 9</u></i>). This shim would be fastened to the
        outer edges of the male half, and filled with the molding sand
        surrounding the positive imprint (<i><u>Fig. 10</u></i>). After cutting
        the pouring channel and vent(s), the two halves would be joined and the
        medal could be cast.<a href="#fn7"

    <p>We decided to experiment with both methods: the Tuttle method and the one
        in Ms. Fr. 640 on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/92r/f/92r/tl"><u>92r</u></a>.
        We wished to test Tuttle’s proposed method to see if it actually worked
        and what difficulties might arise during the process. Second, we wanted
        to see if our hypothetical method, based on fol. 92r—in which we would
        leave the original in the male half of the mold—would be workable and
        what disadvantages or advantages this method might have (<i><u>Vid.
                1</u></i>).</p>

    <p>For all experiments we used the following materials: a brass medal as the
        pattern, wooden casting flasks, sand, ground charcoal dust as a
        separating agent, a metal ruler to level the flasks filled with sand, a
        knife to cut gates into the sand, tin, a cast-iron melting ladle in
        which to melt the tin, a propane torch to melt the tin, and clamps to
        hold together the two halves of the mold. The most difficult of these
        materials to obtain was the sand. Without significant casting
        experience, how were we to decide which sand to use? The Delft clay used
        in a previous experiment seemed inauthentic because it contained oil as
        its binder,<a href="#fn8"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref8"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> and so we searched for a
        so-called “green sand,” bound with water, that was used for casting by
        foundries. We wanted to use a modern sand rather than make our own based
        on a recipe from Ms. Fr. 640, because we hoped that this would remove
        some variables in the experiments (the focus of which was to be on the
        <em>process</em> rather than on the materials) and would provide a
        stable and effective medium for casting. We decided upon a mixture of
        green sand containing 10% clay (bentonite) mixed with 4% water (<i><u>Fig. 11</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 12</u></i>).<a href="#fn9"

    <p>Our choice of sand, however, turned out to negatively affect our casts.
        It was crumbly and very brittle, even more so after we dried it, with
        many loose grains of sand (<i><u>Fig. 13</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 14</u></i>). Possible improvements might include altering the ratio of
        sand-clay-water, pushing the sand through a sieve or cloth to ensure the
        use of only the finest grains, and mixing the mixture longer or more
        thoroughly.<a href="#fn10"

    <h2 id="patricia-tuttles-proposed-method">Patricia Tuttle’s Proposed Method
    </h2>
    <p>Despite the careful text explaining her proposed method and its
        accompanying illustrations, getting a good grasp of Tuttle’s method with
        all its steps proved challenging. Although we understood the basic idea,
        we failed to see exactly how Tuttle proposed to make the shim, so we
        came up with our own solution:<a href="#fn12"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref12"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> We used a thin sheet of wood
        with the shape of the medal cut out (<i><u>Fig. 15</u></i>, <i><u>Fig.
                16</u></i>), instead of Tuttle’s thin third layer of sand. This
        functioned similarly to her proposal, since both methods involved
        producing one side of the mold (male) from the negative imprint in the
        other half (female).<a href="#fn13"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref13"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> Making our wooden shim to fit
        perfectly was the most challenging part of this experiment and proved
        relatively time-consuming and labor-intensive (<i><u>Fig. 17</u></i>,
        <i><u>Fig. 18</u></i>). A shim filled with sand, as proposed by Tuttle,
        may be easier to achieve, although the challenge there might be to leave
        the edges of the positive imprint uncovered while leveling this thin
        third layer of sand.<a href="#fn14"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref14"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> We concluded that the method
        might work if executed with more practice. More experience with the
        casting process and the use of a different type of sand would most
        likely have resulted in a more desirable outcome (<i><u>Fig. 19</u></i>,
        <i><u>Fig. 20</u></i>). We attribute the coarseness of our medal cast to
        our inexperience, as well as to the unsuitable, crumbly sand we
        prepared, rather than to Tuttle’s suggested method. More experimentation
        using different sands and different shims is necessary for a definitive
        conclusion.</p>

    <p>We had made the molds for our first experiment with our hypothesized
        method before conducting the experiments with the Tuttle method, and so
        we used the same unsuitable sand. Nevertheless, following the method
        outlined in Ms. Fr. 640 worked relatively well. We first pressed the
        medal into the sand-filled female half until its flat reverse was level
        with the sand (<i><u>Fig. 21</u></i>). Following this, we could
        immediately move on to making the male half of the flask, without having
        to wait for the female half to dry. To ensure perfect alignment, we put
        the sand-filled male flask on top of the female flask (with a layer of
        lamp black in between as a separator), while the latter still contained
        the original medal (<i><u>Fig. 22</u></i>). We then kept the two halves
        together (<i><u>Fig. 23</u></i>) and turned them upside-down, before
        removing the female half (now on top) with a little tap, which left the
        original medal in position on the male half, which was aligned with its
        impression on the female half (<i><u>Fig. 24</u></i>). Now the original
        medal just needed to be firmly pressed into the sand of the male half
        and remain there during the rest of the casting process (<i><u>Fig.
                25</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 26</u></i>). See Vid. 1.</p>

    <p>The obverse of our cast medal during this first experiment with the
        method in Ms. Fr. 640 was, as in the Tuttle experiment, coarse (<i><u>Fig. 27</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 28</u></i>). The reverse, on the
        other hand, was smooth and highly detailed: a perfect negative of the
        brass original that had formed the pattern (<i><u>Fig. 29</u></i>). We
        concluded that using the original medal as part of the mold could result
        in a highly detailed reverse. The method, as we envisioned it based on
        fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/92r/f/92r/tl"><u>92r</u></a>,
        worked. The coarseness of the obverse seems to be a direct result of the
        coarseness of the sand. Before we poured the metal, we also noted that
        the sand had crumbled on the edges of the imprints in both halves of the
        flask. This most likely caused the molten tin to extend beyond the edge
        of the original medal, enclosing it and making it difficult to separate.

    <p>Because of the disappointing quality of the sand, we decided to do
        another experiment with the manuscript’s method using the green casting
        sand known as Delft clay (a “sand” with an oil binder). We made smaller
        flasks out of mason jar caps (<i><u>Fig. 30</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 31</u></i>) and poured from above, directly into the sand, with the medal
        horizontal instead of almost vertical (<i><u>Fig. 32</u></i>). We also
        chose to push the medal only halfway into the male flask, in order to
        experiment with the thickness of the cast medal. Although at first the
        molten tin did not seem to have entered the mold at all, the result was
        surprisingly good: a tin medal with a clear image on obverse
        <em>and</em> reverse. The main drawback was that the tin failed to flow
        into the entire cavity (<i><u>Fig. 33</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 34</u></i>,
        <i><u>Fig. 35</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 36</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 37</u></i>).
        This may be improved through alterations such as tilting the mold at an
        angle as the metal is poured, heating the tin to a higher temperature
        before pouring, or slightly increasing the diameter of the negative
        imprint—which would also require more filing to be done afterwards (<i><u>Fig. 38</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 39</u></i>). Compared to the Tuttle
        method, the manuscript’s method has the advantage of being less
        time-consuming and labor-intensive: both halves of the mold can be made
        simultaneously, and the additional step of making and drying a shim can
        be skipped altogether.<a href="#fn15"

                rather than the side, the cast had a large gate that required
                the mold to be destroyed in removing the cast. This may be one
                important reason why pouring this way is not recommended.
                Pouring from a gate at the side of the two halves allows the

    <p>Another recipe from Ms. Fr. 640 describes a similar method for making
        medals, which includes leaving the original in the frame mold during the
        entire casting process. The entry on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/83v/f/83v/tl"><u>83v</u></a>
        is is similarly entitled, “Molding in relief on one part and hollow on
        the other” (“<em>Mouler de relief dune part et creux de laultre</em>”):
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>It is necessary to cast two pieces of copper, latten or similar
            metal, very neatly, and then when you have molded the hollow form
            [<em>le cave</em>] in the sand, leave the figure of metal that you
            have molded in the frame, without moving it from its place. And
            cast, &amp; if there is not enough thickness press a little &amp;
            push the figure down in the frame....When you mold, always leave
            your medal in <del>one of</del> <sup>the</sup> frames, <del>is</del>
            <sup>without stirring it</sup>.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>Interestingly, this recipe uses two
        different words for “hollow:” <em>creux</em> and <em>cave</em>. While
        the former is here used for the concave reverse side of the final
        product (the medal), the latter is used to indicate the cavity, or
        negative impression made into one half of the mold. Although not
        entirely consistent, it seems that this distinction can be made more
        generally. In all of the five recipes where we found the use of
        <em>creux</em> in Ms. Fr. 640, the word indicates the hollow part of a
        cast object, i.e., either the hollow reverse of a medal or the hollow or
        cavity on the inside of a more complex object, such as an animal.<a

        hand, is used to denote either object or mold. That is, it is used to
        refer to the hollow part of a piece of equipment used in the process,
        not the end product. This research helped Making and Knowing editorial

    <p>Another technique described in Ms. Fr. 640 to create hollow-relief medals
        is found on fols. <a

        “Giving the thickness that you wish to a medal,” which both use a
        “paste.” On fol. 130v, a <em>lasagne de paste</em> is applied onto the
        impression of the original in the hollow mold:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Next, make a small lasagna of paste of such thickness as you would
            like, and having anointed with butter <del>your</del> the hollow of
            your first hollow mold, adapt the paste to it and then make your
            second mold on top.</p>

    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>Although this entry does not refer to
        medals (or any type of object in particular), this method could
        certainly be used to that end. The entry on fol. 153r–v uses an original
        medal to make the female (hollow) mold half, but rather than pressing
        that medal into the male half, it uses a paste (as in fol. 130v) to
        create a space between the two parts of the mold, on top of which the
        male half of the mold is made.<a href="#fn19"

    <p>However, the concave (or “hollow”) reverse of the products resulting from
        these paste methods are unlikely to have displayed the same level of
        detail as the relief on the obverse, depending on the qualities of the
        paste and the amount of pressure that could be exerted pressing the
        paste into the <em>cave</em> without affecting the mold. Patricia
        Tuttle’s observation that some of the medals she examined displayed
        traces of a cloth fabric:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>others must have had wax pressed into a mold using a piece of cloth,
            possibly as a separator, which left behind its fabric pattern in the
            metal surface. These molds were probably made of plaster, reinforced
            plaster, or sulfur, as the sand molds discussed above would be too
            delicate to withstand the pressure of pressing semi-hard wax against
            their surface.<a href="#fn22"

        does indeed mention that the mold material “sets,” thus indicating a
        plaster mix, and recommends strengthening it with “<em>crocum</em> or
        well-ground iron scales to firm it up.” The fabric pattern may be the
        result of other processes, however, as suggested by fol. 153r–v, where
        the author-practitioner writes, “press on it [the paste] with some
        cotton &amp; your figure will imprint itself in the paste.”</p>

        a relief modeled in wax on a polished black stone, of which he made a

            over the mould with a little candle-smoke. This done, take the

    <p>In addition to this contemporary Italian source, a slightly later Dutch

    <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>To our original question of whether Ms. Fr. 640 provides a practicable
        method for the casting of hollow-relief medals, the answer is a definite
        yes. In fact, it suggests multiple techniques toward this end. The
        multiplicity of techniques and materials used to create medals of this
        sort, as well as for a variety of other types of medals both in Ms. Fr.
        640 and in other contemporary sources, suggests that early modern
        craftsmen used whatever materials were available: original patterns,
        dough, paper, sand, and plaster, all of them serving similar ends.
        Artisans throughout Europe are likely to have known about (and
        experimented with) the various qualities and properties of the materials
        and substances available to them, and deduced how to employ them for
        their purposes.</p>
    <p>Given that the author-practitioner of Ms. Fr. 640 provides various
        methods to obtain similar results, and, given the difference in reverses
        and their level of detail in early modern hollow-relief medals examined
        by Tuttle, it seems likely that there was not one way of doing things,
        although there may have been personal preferences. As Cellini recommends
        when discussing two methods for making a cardinal’s seal: “Do not,
        however, fail to try both, because it is good for you to learn them,
        &amp; you will find them very helpful to you in many ways in other
        branches of the goldsmith’s art.”<a href="#fn29"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref29"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
    <p>Patricia Tuttle noted common features of many hollow-relief medals:
        First, the reverse, she says, is a highly detailed negative of the
        obverse. This could definitely be explained by the Ms. Fr. 640 method on
        fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/92r/f/92r/tl"><u>92r</u></a>,
        in which the original medal remains a part of the mold. Second, there is
        often evidence of filing on extant medals, usually around the perimeter,
        that may suggest increasing the diameter of the imprint on the female
        half (which would also help the molten metal to spread through the
        entire impression). Third, she comments that the reverse is generally
        coarse as compared to the obverse. This, we think, would indicate the
        use of a different method than that explained on fol. 92r, where the use
        of the original as part of the male mold actually seemed to result in
        the opposite: namely, the reverse being sharper than the obverse.<a
           href="#fn30"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref30"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a> Following Tuttle, it may be
        interesting to investigate to what degree a separating agent might
        affect this.</p>
    <p>The goal of making a thin and even casting is intended to decrease the
        likelihood of casting flaws. On this point, on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/102v/f/102v/tl"><u>102v</u></a>,
        “Casting,” the author-practitioner notes that</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Tin comes out better being thin &amp; fine rather than thick, because
            being thick &amp; in great heat, it retracts. Therefore, if you want
            to mold a thick piece in tin, mold it only on one side &amp; with a
            cavity on one side, if it is possible, in that way you will have it
            more neat, and then you will be able to solder two halves together.
        </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>This technical advantage, as Tuttle also
        suggests, may be one compelling reason for the appeal, manufacture, and
        purpose of such hollow-relief cast medals.<a href="#fn31"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref31"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
    <p>Finally, to better understand the techniques used to make hollow-relief
        medals, more experimentation is necessary, as well as more research in
        early modern sources, searching both for related recipes and for
        vocabulary used. Perhaps most fruitful, however, would be to examine
        extant medals for traces of their facture in light of the new
        information presented in this essay.</p>
    <p>In 2016 and 2017, subsequent to completion of this essay, the Making and
        Knowing Team examined hollow-relief medals from the Scher Collection in
        the Frick Collection. We observed on the sixteenth- and
        seventeenth-century medals the traces of a remarkable variety of
        techniques (also observed by Patricia Tuttle in her research). No firm
        conclusions about the exact techniques used could be drawn without
        scientific analysis (such as photogrammetry), but these traces indicated
        that the materials and techniques in Ms. Fr. 640 for creating
        hollow-relief medals seem to have been employed in the production of
        extant medals.<a href="#fn32"

                <p>Of these terms, “incuse-reverse” might seem the least
                    confusing given its specificity, but it also implies a
                    different technique than that which is actually used. As
                    Patricia Tuttle explains, this term derives “from the Latin
                    <em>incusus</em>, ‘hammered or stamped-in, an impression in
                    intaglio.’” Patricia Tuttle, “An Investigation of the
                    Renaissance Casting Techniques of Incuse-Reverse and
                    Double-Sided Medals,” <em>Studies in the History of Art</em>
                    21 (1987): 207. This technique of stamping an impression
                    into a medal was used for the manufacture of coins, for
                    example, and as such we feel that this is not an accurate
                    enough description of the method and its products discussed
                    in Ms. Fr. 640. The alternative designations “without
                    reverse,” “one-sided,” and “uniface” can also be used for
                    medals that have a flat reverse. We argue that going back to
                    period terms may be the most useful. Support for this can be
                    found in the few extant early modern sources that mention
                    such medals. As discussed in this essay, the author of Ms.
                    Fr. 640 uses the words <em>cave</em> and <em>creux</em>,
                    which are both best translated as “hollow.” A handwritten
                    1629 Dutch treatise concerning the casting of medals also
                    uses an equivalent of “hollow” (<em>hol</em>). The author of
                    this treatise further explains that medals with such a
                    hollow may seem to be pressed, rather than cast (<em>als off
                        sy gedreven waer</em>). These handwritten notes come
                    from the papers of Constantijn Huygens and are currently

                    two sides separately and joining them together by their
                    edges, are exceptional before the seventeenth century, it is
                    quite common in the sixteenth century to find such hollow
                    castings of single sides. They are often so fine that nearly
                    every detail is as plain on the back as on the front; that
                    side of the mould which produced the hollow back was
                    evidently an exact positive reproduction of the model of the
                    front,” from George F. Hill, <em>Medals of the

                    difference in melting points between the material of the

                    It would be interesting to further experiment with slight
                    variations of this factor with experienced founders, perhaps
                    even trying to cast a very thin medal using an original of a
                    similar metal, but that is significantly heavier
                    (thicker)—so that the thin layer of molten metal has

                <p>With the difference being that in the entry on fol. 130v, the
                    butter is applied between the dried female mold and the
                    paste, and in the recipe on fol. 153r–v, the butter is
                    applied over the paste before adding the sand for the male
                    half on top of that. Our experiment on December 8, 2014
                    suggests that this latter method causes the sand to stick to
                    the paste, thus ruining the male mold when it is removed
                    from the female half. Further experiments with the amount
                    and temperature of the butter and the drying of the male
                    mold before removing it again may result in new insights.<a

                <p>During our experiments with Tonny Beentjes, we (Tonny
                    Beentjes, Jonah Rowen, and Rozemarijn Landsman) wondered
                    whether the recipe “Casting in frames” on fol. 118v also
                    used a method to make hollow-relief casts. After careful
                    study, however, we concluded this was not the case. The
                    author-practitioner fills the female half of the box mold
                    with sand, covering the medal (although in a note he says
                    that he first filled the mold with sand and then pressed the
                    medal into it). Then, turning this half of the box mold
                    around so that the medal faces upwards, he draws a line on
                    the back of the medal (near the edge [<em>bord</em>]) that
                    continues onto the sand, to indicate where to make the
                    pouring gate [<em>pour denoter la place pour faire le
                        gect</em>]. Without removing the medal from the female
                    half, he then adds a layer of charcoal onto the still
                    uncovered side [<em>contour</em>] of the medal, adds the
                    male half of the flask on top of the female half, and fills
                    it with sand. Only after both halves of the mold are made
                    does he remove the medal. Thus, this would make an exact
                    replica of the original medal, rather than a hollow-relief
                    version.<a href="#fnref21"

                    manuscript to Huygens (together with more notes concerning
                    lifecasting) is unlikely to have been the author of the
                    treatise. It is attributed to the goldsmith Adriaen

                <p>Interestingly, the Dutch author comments that such a
                    one-sided hollow cast medal looks “as if it were embossed”
                    (<em>alsoff sy gedreven waer</em>). This brings us back to
                    the discussion about terminology and why “incuse-reverse”
                    may not be a good name for the process, although the
                    association with embossing is justified. The outcome of both
                    processes is similar. Ms. Fr. 640 offers at least one recipe
                    concerning an embossing technique: fol. 120r, “Medals
                    stamped from wax.”<a href="#fnref27"

                <p>The effect or benefit of this extra step remains unclear to
                    us. Could it be that the first female mold half had become
                    too dry to use?<a href="#fnref28"

                <p>Of course, this would also depend on the sand used for the
                    mold. It would be interesting to see whether it is also
                    possible to use an original medal that is already
                    hollow-relief. This would allow for the medal to be first
                    used to impress the upper half of the mold, while leaving it
                    in the lower half. Perhaps this would result in a smoother
                    surface for the obverse as compared to that of the reverse.
                    But, depending on the reverse of the original, would a medal
                    cast this way also obtain the same level of detail on the
                    obverse? Furthermore, as Tonny Beentjes suggested, it might
                    be worthwhile to measure shrinkage in either method, since
                    in theory the Ms. Fr. 640 method would cause the details on
                    the reverse to be slightly larger than on the obverse. One
                    could, for example, measure this difference using precise
                    3D-scanning.<a href="#fnref30"
