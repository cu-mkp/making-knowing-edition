        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <div>
            <p>Historians know little about how armor was made black. This essay
                starts to fill the lacuna by examining a sixteenth-century
                recipe, “Black varnish for sword guard, bands for trunks, etc.,”
                on fol. <a
                   href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/4v/f/4v/tl"><u>4v</u></a>
                of Ms. Fr. 640. What was black varnish for armor? How was it
                made and applied? What ingredients and techniques were used?
                What purposes did it serve? Using a combination of
                reconstruction and textual research, this essay suggests that
                “Black varnish for sword guard” was used as an etching ground, a
                rust-protection coat, and a finish to impart luster and
                brilliance to armor and metals. The reconstructions underpinning
                this essay give insights into the varnish ingredients and show
                that success (or failure) in making and applying black varnish
                depended as much on the properties of the ingredients as on an
                artisan’s knowledge of heat, metals, and tools—as well as the
                skill of working with them.</p>

    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
    <p>Seventeenth-century paintings like Jan Brueghel the Elder’s Milan
        <em>Allegory of Fire</em> (1608) (<i><u>Fig. 1</u></i>) or the portrait
        <em>Holy Roman Emperor Charles V</em> copied after Titian (<i><u>Fig. 2</u></i>) show that early modern black armor was not uncommon.
        Yet, while we have evidence of black armor’s existence, primary sources
        are silent on the making process, and historians have no knowledge of
        how armor was made black. This essay aims to start filling this lacuna
        in the history of arms and armor, and that of black armor in particular,
        by reconstructing a sixteenth-century recipe for a “black varnish for
        sword guard, bands for trunks, etc.,” described in BnF Ms. Fr. 640. This
        detailed recipe, which outlines the preparation of a varnish and its
        application to metal, is part of a larger cluster of entries devoted to
        the making of black varnishes that collectively cover fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/4v/f/4v/tl"><u>4v</u></a>
        of the manuscript. These seem to be the only sixteenth-century recipes
        for varnishes for armor now known to scholars. For later periods,
        sources show that varnishes for metal were not uncommon and that recipes
        for armor varnishing were circulating among metalworkers.</p>

    <p>What was black varnish for armor? How was it made and applied? What
        ingredients and techniques were used in the process? What purposes did
        it serve? In the absence of written instructions on how to make armor
        black, I attempted to answer these questions by conducting two closely
        related exploratory experiments: first, the reconstruction of the “black
        varnish for sword guard, bands for trunks, etc” detailed on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/4v/f/4v/tl"><u>4v</u></a>,
        and second, the reconstruction of a sixteenth-century German sword guard
        based on a model in the Wallace Collection in London and the subsequent
        varnishing of that guard according to the instructions on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/4v/f/4v/tl"><u>4v</u></a>
        (<i><u>Fig. 3</u></i>). These two reconstructions and the insights
        gained from them are supported by textual research, particularly into
        sources from the history of arms and armor in later, better documented
        periods, as well as from sources that record early modern practices as
        diverse as locksmithing, bronze sculpting, painting, and even
        woodworking. This recipe thus sits at the intersection of a myriad of
        making processes.</p>

    <p>Although the reconstructions for this essay did not yield definitive
        answers to the many questions raised by the recipe “Black varnish for
        sword guard,” my experiments afforded important insights about the
        recipe’s ingredients, the process of preparation and application, and
        its possible purposes. These insights open a path for further research
        and reconstructions—both of the varnish central to this essay and of
        others in Ms. Fr. 640.</p>
    <h2 id="possible-purposes-of-black-varnish-for-sword-guard">Possible
        purposes of “Black varnish for sword guard”</h2>
    <p>The entry “Black varnish for sword guard” describes a process of
        preparing and applying an oil-based varnish. It can be divided into
        three steps. First, the oil is boiled with garlic, hog’s fennel, and
        bread crusts to degrease it. Next, the author-practitioner adds black
        pitch and grains of wheat and continues boiling it. Finally, when the
        pitch is melted and the oil has body, the varnish is applied on iron by
        heating the metal and painting the varnish on with a feather or a brush.
    </p>
    <p>“Black varnish for sword guard” is one of three entries on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/4v/f/4v/tl"><u>4v</u></a>
        devoted to varnishes on metal with marginal notes suggesting further
        variations. These entries all describe the making of black oil-based
        varnishes (using linseed, walnut, or spike lavender oil), but, in
        contrast to the varnish central to this essay, the other two are
        prepared without heating and one is intended as an etching ground. A
        marginal comment on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/4v/f/4v/tl"><u>4v</u></a>
        directs the reader to the “chapter on furbishers,” specifically fols. <a

           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref1"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> Although these entries do not
        shed light on the question of why armor was varnished black, they do
        tell us more about the different ingredients used in metal varnishes and
        that their method of preparation and purpose could vary. Moreover, they
        demonstrate the author-practitioner’s interest in varnishes for metal,
        its various types, and the furbisher’s craft.</p>
    <h2 id="etching-ground">Etching ground</h2>
    <p>Although “Black varnish for sword guard” is the only known
        sixteenth-century recipe for metal varnishes, a later source illustrates
        that such recipes were not exclusive to Ms. Fr. 640. In his <em>La
            fidelle ouverture de l'art de serrurier</em> (1627), the French
        locksmith Mathurin Jousse (c.1575–1645) also speaks of a <em>vernis de
            fourbisseurs</em> (varnish of furbishers).<a href="#fn2"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref2"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> While historians of metalworking
        are familiar with Jousse’s work, and it has been discussed by, for
        example, the metalworker and historian of science Cyril Stanley Smith,
        the chapter in which Jousse records the varnish has not been studied by
        historians of arms and armor.<a href="#fn3"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref3"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> Jousse’s discussion of “varnish
        of furbishers” is important not only for what it can tell us about the
        recipe on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/4v/f/4v/tl"><u>4v</u></a>,
        but also for what it reveals about the possible transmission of
        knowledge among early modern metalworkers—in this case, locksmiths and
        furbishers—and the organization of some entries in Ms. Fr. 640 more
        generally.</p>
    <p>Varnish of furbishers is mentioned in chapter ten of Jousse’s <em>La
            fidelle ouverture</em>, which opens with instructions on how to
        color iron and steel.<a href="#fn4"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref4"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> After you have colored and heated
        your metal, Jousse explains, you can varnish your pieces—for the
        purposes of making <em>fueillages</em> (branchwork) or <em>escritures
            blanches</em> (white writings)—with a mixture of lead white and
        yellow wax or, alternatively, with varnish of furbishers, “made with
        walnut oil, white of leek, and galipot, which is a gum that one gets
        from the druggists [<em>droguistes</em>], all boiled together.”<a
           href="#fn5"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref5"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> In contrast to the
        author-practitioner, Jousse does not apply the varnish of furbishers to
        armor and does not distinguish it as black. Nevertheless, there are
        important similarities between Jousse’s recipe and “Black varnish for
        sword guard” of Ms. Fr. 640. First, both recipes involve making
        oil-based varnishes and list the same ingredients: walnut oil (suggested
        by the author-practitioner as a cheap alternative to linseed oil), white
        of leek (similar to the garlic and onions), and galipot (recorded by the
        author-practitioner in the margin and proposed as an ingredient to use
        in “five or six lb of oil”). Second, they are both hot (as opposed to
        cold) varnishes, meaning that they are prepared by boiling the
        ingredients over a fire, that are then applied to heated metal. The
        similarities between the two sources give the impression that the “black
        varnish for sword guard” of Ms. Fr. 640, just like the varnish produced
        by Jousse’s recipe, could be used as an etching ground. The fact that
        the author-practitioner includes another entry devoted to “Varnish of
        iron etchers” on the same page (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/4v/f/4v/tl"><u>4v</u></a>)
        adds weight to this assumption.<a href="#fn6"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref6"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
    <p>Exactly how the locksmith Jousse learned about a furbisher’s varnish is
        unclear, yet evidence in Ms. Fr. 640 points to collaborations between
        furbishers and locksmiths. On fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/95r/f/95r/tl"><u>95r</u></a>,
        the author-practitioner explains that “the first thing the furbisher
        does when he gets his new blades is to draw out their tang, which he
        does himself, or has done by locksmiths or farriers, giving him some
        liard [i.e., a small-denomination coin] for his charcoal.”<a href="#fn7"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref7"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> The author-practitioner’s remark
        and Jousse’s discussion of a furbisher’s varnish suggest early modern
        collaboration or outsourcing among various types of metalworkers. Jousse
        may have worked in this way with furbishers and shared varnish recipes.
        Be that as it may, Jousse’s knowledge of the varnish of furbishers
        illustrates that recipes like “Black varnish for sword guard” were
        circulating among early modern metalworkers and could have been used for
        metal objects other than armor.</p>
    <h2 id="rust-protection">Rust protection</h2>
    <p>While Jousse’s work leads us to think of the “black varnish for sword
        guard” in terms of etching practices, another set of sources related to
        arms, armor, and metalworking strongly suggests it could have served as
        a rust-protection layer. The process described in “Black varnish for
        sword guard” is essentially that of blackening armor. The concept of
        <em>noircir</em> (to blacken) in the context of armor making is defined
        by A. Paulin-Désormeaux in his <em>Manuel de l'armurier, du fourbisseur
            et de l'arquebusier: ou Traité complet et simplifié de ces arts</em>
        (1832): “To blacken: to heat pieces [of metal] after they have been
        forged and polished properly and to rub them with ox horn when they are
        very hot, so as to protect them against rust.”<a href="#fn8"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref8"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> While Paulin-Désormeaux’s
        definition does not refer to varnish, and the author-practitioner does
        not use ox horn, both methods involve rubbing or applying a substance—ox
        horn or varnish—onto hot metal in order to blacken it. Moreover, though
        <em>Manuel de l’armurier</em> dates from the nineteenth century and,
        therefore, has no direct bearing on Ms. Fr. 640, when brought into
        conversation with earlier sources, Paulin-Désormeaux’s work becomes a
        later piece of evidence of a long-standing concern about protecting
        metal from rust. As Giambattista della Porta (1535–1615) notes in his
        widely disseminated text on natural magic, this concern can be traced as
        far back as Pliny.<a href="#fn9"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref9"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
    <p>Artisans experimented with a variety of materials to protect metals from
        rust; oil, animal fats and proteins, and resins dominate the textual
        sources. In a discussion of iron, Della Porta writes that “many have
        laboured” to protect their iron works against “that poysoned corruption
        of rust,” and he listed a number of different methods:<a href="#fn10"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref10"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Pliny saith, That Iron is preserved from rust, by Ceruss, Gip, and
            liquid Pitch. But he shews not how Ceruss may be made: Yet those
            that know how to make Oyl from Ceruss without Vinegar, Iron being
            smeered therewith, is easily preserved from rust. Some anoynt the
            Iron with Deers suet, and so keep it free from rust, but I use the
            fat substance in the Hoofs of Oxen.<a href="#fn11"
               class="footnote-ref"
               id="fnref11"
               role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>Applying oil and animal fat to iron or
        steel appears to have been a common technique for metalworkers. The
        locksmith Jousse, for example, recommends the use of “sheep, or goat, or
        ox horn” and oil or tallow to blacken locks and prevent them from
        rusting:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Then you hold [the metal] over the fire and heat it so hot, that in
            putting sheep, or goat or ox horn on it, it burns and forms a black
            filth that attaches itself to the iron: after it has almost cooled
            you will apply a little bit of oil, or tallow, which will prevent
            the rust from being welcome there.<a href="#fn12"
               class="footnote-ref"
               id="fnref12"
               role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>In a subsequent chapter, Jousse also
        advises applying boiled and desalted olive oil to heated locks.<a
           href="#fn13"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref13"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> While others also mixed lead
        filings with oil, Jousse argues that plain rosin “will preserve [locks]
        much longer than oil.”<a href="#fn14"

        “they heat [tinned nails and other works] &amp; pass some rosin over the
        top, which coats it with a shiny skin like varnish.”</p>
    <p>Yet, while it was common for metalworkers to apply oil, animal fats, and
        rosin to their works, Della Porta also reports that Pliny suggests
        liquid pitch. The work of the eighteenth-century chemist Pierre François
        Tingry (1743–1821) provides insight into the possible meanings of pitch
        and the possible purpose of “black pitch” in the author-practitioner’s
        “black varnish for sword guard.” Tingry’s detailed section devoted to
        this material, entitled “Black solid pitch with a smooth shining
        surface,” is worth quoting at length:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Black smooth pitch has often been confounded with naval pitch; and
            these denominations have even been considered as synonymous. Black
            pitch is a constant object of commerce; but naval pitch is prepared
            in the sea ports at the time when it is employed. Black pitch, which
            is transported in casks, is of a darker or lighter colour. It
            appears to be dry and friable, but flows and extends itself when
            exposed to a mean temperature. It is believed to be a compound of
            the more solid part of tar mixed over the fire with resin. Black
            pitch of a good quality, when broken by a sudden stroke, ought to be
            smooth, pulverulent, and exceedingly brilliant on the fracture. This
            kind of pitch is that used by locksmiths for varnishing articles
            which they wish to preserve from rust, such as locks, latches, and
            bolts destined for the doors of cellars, and of other places exposed
            to moisture. For this purpose, nothing is necessary but to heat the
            article, and to rub over it a piece of this pitch, partly wrapped up
            in paper, that it may not stick to the hand. The heat of the metal
            liquefies the pitch; and as soon as it dries the resinous part that
            has been applied, the result is a black, durable, and shining
            varnish.<a href="#fn15"

    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>Tingry’s rich and instructive description
        bears a number of important similarities to the recipe on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/4v/f/4v/tl"><u>4v</u></a>,
        most strikingly in the reference to “black pitch.” Like the
        author-practitioner of Ms. Fr. 640, Tingry also speaks of a varnish
        (although not including oil) which is black, contains pitch, is applied
        to heated metal, and is dried over the fire. Most significant for this
        essay is that Tingry’s black varnish, which so strongly resembles that
        of Ms. Fr. 640, was used to keep metal “articles” free from rust.
        Indeed, varnishing metal was a well-known technique by which early
        modern metalworkers battled corrosion. According to sculpture historian
        Frits Scholten, the Dutch bronze sculptor Adriaen de Vries (1556–1626)
        applied oil-based varnishes to his metal sculptures to protect them from
        rust and add to their durability.<a href="#fn16"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref16"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
    <p>In sum, by reading the entry “Black varnish for sword guard” in tandem
        with the various later sources, it seems probable that the recipe
        indicates an early modern metalworker’s larger interest in rust
        prevention on iron and steel.</p>
    <h2 id="luster-and-brilliance">Luster and brilliance </h2>
    <p>While the above-cited sources suggest that the author-practitioner’s
        “black varnish for sword guard” functioned as an anti-rust coating, they
        also imply that materials like black pitch and oil imparted lustre and
        brilliance to a varnish, thereby creating a visual effect on any armor
        to which it was applied.</p>
    <p>As Tingry describes, applying black pitch to hot metal results in “a
        black, durable and <em>shining</em> varnish.”<a href="#fn17"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref17"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> Similarly, the

        that locksmiths rub <em>rousine</em> (rosin) on their iron works to
        create a “shiny skin like varnish.” Additionally, on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/95r/f/95r/tl"><u>95r</u></a>,
        the author-practitioner remarks that furbishers sometimes applied “a
        drop or two of oil [on a sword] which they spread with the finger to
        give it luster.” Moreover, while Adriaen de Vries mainly used oil
        varnishes to protect the metal of his bronze sculptures, Scholten
        explains that “the combination of the already highly reflective surface
        of the polished metal and an additional sense of depth imparted by the
        varnish created the typically ‘lacquered’ look.”<a href="#fn18"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref18"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> Likewise, in 1559 the sculptor
        Benvenuto Cellini (1500–1571) wrote that “there was still some gold
        missing [on his celebrated bronze Perseus], and it needed varnishing
        here and there and a number of other things that are really an intrinsic
        part of a statue’s finish.”<a href="#fn19"

    <p>Yet oil and black pitch were not the only ingredients that could impart a
        brilliant and lustrous quality to the varnish. A number of sources
        indicate that bread crusts, garlic, and onions could be used to enhance
        this effect as well. This might help us interpret the
        author-practitioner’s intention in “degreasing” (<em>desgraisser</em>)
        his oil by adding garlic, hog’s fennel, and bread crusts: “Take linseed
        oil or more cheaply, walnut oil, and rid it of grease with garlic &amp;
        <del>onions</del> +hog’s fennel, some also add bread crusts.”<a

           role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> My initial assumption that
        “degreasing” meant to rid the oil of fat, similar to the modern-day
        preparation of cold-pressed linseed oil that rids the oil of fatty
        acids, was informed by texts on the use of garlic and onions in oil
        varnishes. The Spanish painters Francisco Pacheco del Río (1564–1644)
        and Antonio Palomino (1653–1726) both mention the use of garlic in
        “drying” fat oils.<a href="#fn21"

    <p>Additionally, two lines into the entry on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/4v/f/4v/tl"><u>4v</u></a>,
        in a sublinear addition written directly below the instructions to “rid
        [the oil] of grease with garlic &amp; <del>onions</del> +hog’s fennel,”
        the author-practitioner mentions that “some also add bread crusts.” The
        position of this addition on the page—that is, the structural
        arrangement of the recipe—and, more specifically, its proximity to the
        instruction to degrease the oil, led me to assume a direct and
        meaningful relation between the garlic, hog’s fennel, and bread
        crusts—in other words, I took all ingredients to be “degreasers.”</p>
    <p>What such “degreasing” could do for a varnish is laid out in
        nineteenth-century cabinet maker Albert Albrest’s <em>L’art de
            l’ébéniste</em> (1828). Albrest explains that adding burned,
        carbonized bread crusts to boiled linseed and turpentine oil would
        purify (<em>purifier</em>) or discolor (<em>décolorer</em>) the liquid.
        Applying an oil thus prepared to a piece of wood would “better fill
        [its] pores, [and render] the varnish that it [had] to receive more
        brilliant and more smooth.”<a href="#fn26"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref26"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a> Based on this textual research
        on the properties of the ingredients, it is thus plausible to argue that
        the garlic, onions, hog’s fennel, and bread crusts would not only rid
        the oil of grease and render it faster drying when applied, but, in
        doing so, simultaneously—like the oil and black pitch—add to the luster
        and brilliance of the varnish.</p>
    <p>By bringing the recipe “Black varnish for sword guard” into conversation
        with other period sources, we can conclude that it might have served
        three possible purposes: first, it could have been used as an etching
        ground; second, it might have served as protection against rust; and
        finally, it may have added luster and brilliance to metals, thus
        enhancing their visual effects.</p>
    <p>While textual research allows us to make plausible claims, a
        reconstruction of the varnish can test these hypotheses. The next
        section of this essay recounts my reconstruction of the black varnish
        for armor on fol. <a

        that I made, and the historical insights gained from both. While this
        practical labor did not yield any definitive answers and many
        uncertainties still surround the entry “Black varnish for sword guard,”
        my experiments afforded insights about the recipe’s key components, such
        as the ingredients and the processes of preparation and application.
        They also strengthen the textual insights about the function of the
        varnish.</p>

        Reconstructing “Black varnish for sword guard, bands for trunks, etc.”
    </h2>
    <p>The following account of my reconstruction is divided into three parts:
        the making of the “black varnish for sword guard” following instructions
        on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/4v/f/4v/tl"><u>4v</u></a>,
        the reconstruction of a sixteenth-century sword guard (Fig. 3), and the
        application of the varnish to it. This varnishing process, in turn,
        consisted of four separate trials: the first three tested different ways
        to heat and varnish flat pieces of metal, using either a hot plate or a
        blow torch, and the fourth trial applied the varnish to the
        reconstructed sword guard.</p>
    <h2 id="making-the-varnish">Making the varnish</h2>
    <p>The ingredients listed on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/4v/f/4v/tl"><u>4v</u></a>
        are linseed oil, black pitch (I used colophony), and wheat grains.<a

           id="fnref27"

        boiled the linseed oil and then added the colophony and the wheat

        question of the “black” in “black varnish for sword guard,” suggesting
        that the color resulted from both ingredients in the varnish and the
        application of heat to metal.</p>

        confirmed this doubt: when I added the colophony to the hot oil, there
        was little change in color visible and the liquid only turned from a
        light to a dark amber at best, instead of to the expected black (<i><u>Fig. 7</u></i> and <i><u>Fig. 8</u></i>). It was unclear at this
        point if this was due to a mistake I had made in the amount (i.e., more
        colophony was necessary), or if I should have chosen a different
        material for black pitch.</p>

    <p>Oil may have been an additional material factor in generating a black
        varnish. A modern technique for blackening armor employed by blacksmith
        Jeff Wasson is to rub a layer of olive oil onto the cold surface of a
        metal plate and heat it from both sides with a blow torch (<i><u>Vid.
                1</u></i>). The result is a black finish (<i><u>Fig. 13</u></i>).</p>

    <p>This technique is similar to that described by the author-practitioner in
        his recipe for “Yellow varnish” on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/96v/f/96v/tl"><u>96v</u></a>:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>One whitens very strongly &amp; one cleans the guards well. Next, one
            applies walnut <del>olive</del> oil all over them with a feather
            while they are cold, and next turns them over a good charcoal fire
            that is on the furbishers’ furnace, without them touching the
            charcoal or the ash. And when they do not smoke anymore, it is done.
        </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>Like Jeff Wasson, the author-practitioner
        also applies oil to cold metal and heats it over the fire. Given the
        similarities in technique, it is likely that the varnish the
        author-practitioner describes here will also turn black when heated. The
        “yellow” in the title may refer to the color of the varnish—i.e., of the
        oil—before it is heated over the fire. The difference with “the black
        varnish for sword guard” on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/4v/f/4v/tl"><u>4v</u></a>
        might be that the latter would already have been black in and of
        itself.<a href="#fn30"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref30"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a> Speaking of yellow as opposed to
        black varnish might have been a useful way to distinguish between two
        varnishes that would both turn black over the heat. This technique of
        using heat to blacken oil applied to metal suggests the possible
        multipurpose nature of the oil in the varnish recipe on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/4v/f/4v/tl"><u>4v</u></a>,
        but it also points to another component that could help color the
        varnished metal black: heat.</p>
    <h2 id="heat">Heat </h2>
    <p>The four trials devoted to heating the metal and applying the varnish
        revealed the key role of heat in producing a varnish with a black
        finish. In the first test, a metal piece was heated over a hot plate,
        removed from the heat source prior to applying the varnish, and not
        reheated after (<i><u>Fig. 14</u></i>). Because the sheet was held over
        the hot plate with pliers, only the tip of the metal was in full contact
        with the heat source and the piece was thus heated unevenly (<i><u>Fig. 15</u></i>). As a result, the metal soon displayed the entire
        gamut of colors that results from heating steel—ranging from yellow or
        gold where it was coolest to purple and blue where it was in direct
        contact with the heat (<i><u>Fig. 16</u></i> and <i><u>Fig. 17</u></i>).<a href="#fn31"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref31"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a> Most importantly, after having
        applied the varnish, the resulting coat was not black but rather
        translucent and irregular, and the colored steel was still visible
        through it (<i><u>Fig. 18</u></i>). So while the grains helped blacken
        the varnish in the process of preparation, they apparently did not
        suffice to ensure a black coat once applied to the metal.</p>

    <p>Trial two determined that heat was instrumental to blackening the
        varnish. In this experiment, pieces of sheet metal were heated lying
        flat in a cast iron pan. The pan was kept on the heat source both prior
        to <em>and after</em> the metal pieces in it had been varnished (<i><u>Fig. 19</u></i>). As in trial one, the metal plates changed color
        in the process of heating. Likely due to the more direct and even heat,
        the metal did not show a rainbow of colors all at once, but instead
        revealed them more or less one by one during the heating process
        (compare Fig. 19, <i><u>Fig. 20</u></i>, and <i><u>Fig. 21</u></i>). The
        coat of varnish was also affected by the more direct and even heat. It
        gradually darkened in the heating process and the coat was no longer
        translucent and irregular, as in trial one, but had turned into a dark
        brown, smooth, and shiny finish that did not reveal the colored metal
        underneath (<i><u>Fig. 22</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 23</u></i>, and <i><u>Fig. 24</u></i>). Nevertheless, the varnish, although noticeably
        darker than in trial one, was still not black.</p>

    <p>The third and fourth experiments revealed that what made the varnish
        black was the intensity of the heat used. In trials three and four, a
        metal plate and the sword guard were heated over the flame of a blow
        torch, held with tongs and a clamp, respectively, and were only briefly
        removed from the heat source for the purpose of varnishing but quickly
        reheated thereafter (<i><u>Fig. 25</u></i> and <i><u>Fig. 26</u></i>).
        After only a few seconds (as opposed to minutes with the hot plate), the
        steel changed color—a fact that illustrated the difference in
        temperature between the flame of a blow torch and the heat radiating off
        a hot plate (<i><u>Fig. 27</u></i>). Only seconds after I had applied
        the varnish and begun reheating the metal with the torch, the varnish
        turned from a yellow-brown translucent liquid into a dark, opaque, and
        shiny black coat (<i><u>Fig. 28</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 29</u></i>, and <i><u>Fig. 30</u></i>).</p>

    <p>In sum, my trials determined that heat, and probably also the wheat
        grains and oil, were key in producing a black varnish. In the next
        section, I will show that the techniques and tools by which the varnish
        was applied to the metal, and the knowledge of how to use them, were
        equally important in producing black varnished armor.</p>

        the author practitioner writes: “Then, to varnish, place your iron over
        a low charcoal fire &amp; apply your varnish with a feather or a brush.
        And when you see that it no longer smokes, it is done and your varnish
        is dry.”<a href="#fn32"

        straightforward, they do not explain to the reader exactly when to apply
        the varnish, i.e., when the metal is hot enough to paint the varnish on
        it. Jousse considered the general question of “knowing when the metal is
        hot” of such importance to the practice of locksmithing that he devotes
        one of the opening chapters of his <em>La fidelle ouverture</em> to the
        subject, arguing it was “the thing which one must learn the first.”<a

        Perhaps the author-practitioner took such knowledge for granted, for it
        was essential to any metalworker’s craft. Speaking about the metallurgy
        of early modern swords, Alan Williams notes that “there would have been
        no accurate method for measuring time, and only empirical methods for
        measuring temperature” in the heating of metal.<a href="#fn34"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref34"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a> The French cabinet maker
        André-Jacob Roubo (1739–1791) describes one of these methods: “then [the
        metal piece] will be heated on a steel plate placed on a forge,
        observing that it is heated evenly everywhere, and to such a degree of
        heat that one cannot easily touch it with the top of the hand.”<a
           href="#fn35"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref35"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>35</sup></a> Roubo here instructs his readers
        to employ their bodily senses—vision, to see if the metal is heated
        evenly, and touch, to feel the temperature of the metal to determine if
        it is sufficiently hot to varnish. Jousse uses a similar technique to
        heat, color, and varnish metal:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>after you have polished your work, you take hot ashes, and passed
            first through the <em>crible</em>, putting your work inside, and you
            will let it heat there until it takes a color that seems good to you
            ... If you do not have ashes to give it the color you want, heat
            some rather large iron, and put your polished work on top. Soon you
            will see it take the colors that I have said above ... After your
            iron has been turned blue, violet, or another color, you take
            varnish, then you heat your iron a little and apply a little of your
            varnish on top, and let it cool off a bit.<a href="#fn36"
               class="footnote-ref"
               id="fnref36"
               role="doc-noteref"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>Like Roubo, Jousse also suggests using hot
        iron (as an alternative to hot ashes) to heat metal pieces for
        varnishing and ascribes an equally important role to observation of the
        changing color of metal as an indicator of heat.<a href="#fn37"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref37"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
    <p>Such sensory techniques, and especially the color change, proved useful
        to my reconstruction. While the author-practitioner does not inform us
        exactly when to apply the varnish, he does explain on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/4v/f/4v/tl"><u>4v</u></a>
        when it is done: “And when you see that it no longer smokes, it is done
        and your varnish is dry.” I reverse engineered his instructions and
        reasoned that the metal plates would be hot enough when I could
        <em>see</em> smoke coming off the varnish upon applying it to the metal.
        My first trial showed that the varnish first began to smoke when the
        metal started to turn blue (<i><u>Vid. 2</u></i>). That color, rather
        than a temperature taken using a laser thermometer, was then used as an
        indication of temperature for the remaining three trials. Yet, even when
        the varnish in trial one had stopped smoking, it was not dry—as the
        author-practitioner says it would be—but rather tacky (Fig. 18). As with
        blackening the varnish in the previous section, heat proved instrumental
        here, too. While in trial one, heat was only applied before varnishing
        the metal, in trial two, the metal was heated prior to and after
        varnishing. When I reheated the varnish after it had been painted onto
        the metal, it not only produced more smoke, but importantly, when it
        stopped smoking, it was no longer tacky (compare Fig. 18 and Fig. 30; <i><u>Vid. 3</u></i>), and the result was a shiny, smooth film (Fig.
        30). The two trials with the blow torch, furthermore, revealed that the
        intensity of the heat source does not just blacken the varnish, but
        produces more (or less) smoke (<i><u>Fig. 31</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 32</u></i>).</p>

    <p>This outcome illustrates how reconstructions give insight into
        qualitative statements that indicate material states or stages in the
        process. When the author-practitioner says “it is done and your varnish
        is dry,” he means it is no longer tacky. Thus, my reconstruction
        afforded proof of concept, since the varnish was indeed dry when it
        stopped smoking. It is important to note that control of heat, which
        Jousse held to be central knowledge for the metalworker, was crucial in
        my reconstruction process. Not only did heat change the color of the
        metal and darkened the tint of its varnish, it also “dried” the varnish
        layer.</p>
    <h2 id="applying-the-varnish---tools">Applying the varnish - Tools </h2>
    <p>The tools and their use in applying varnish also contributed to the
        finished appearance. The instructions on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/4v/f/4v/tl"><u>4v</u></a>
        specify to varnish using “a feather or a brush.” In the first trial, I
        used a feather to apply the varnish (<i><u>Fig. 33</u></i>). In
        experiments two to four, I employed a 1-inch paint brush (Fig. 28, <i><u>Fig. 34</u></i>, and <i><u>Fig. 35</u></i>). Although the heat of
        the metal liquified the varnish (illustrating another function of heat),
        which made it easier to apply, I struggled to spread the mixture evenly
        and smoothly across the steel plate with the feather. This could have
        been due to the fact that I simply had too little experience to control
        the feather or that the varnish was too thick.</p>

    <p>The use of the brush in my following three trials facilitated the
        application. When I ran the brush over the hot metal, I felt more in
        control, and it was easier to cover parts of the sheet with varnish.
        Yet, while the brush noticeably simplified this process, the resulting
        coat showed occasional traces of brush strokes, which caused an
        irregular finish (<i><u>Fig. 36</u></i>). Although we do not know what
        the varnished surface of a period sword guard would have looked like, it
        seems unlikely that an uneven, patchy finish bearing clear traces of
        tools or techniques used in the application process would have been
        desirable (both from an aesthetic and a practical point of view).
        Tingry’s note that locksmiths’ black varnish made with pitch has “a
        <em>smooth</em> shining surface” supports this assumption.<a

        saying one needs to use a feather or brush, and I only noticed the brush
        strokes after the varnish had dried, I could only hypothesize about what
        caused the strokes and how to prevent them in future trials. My
        assumption was that the varnish was still too thick or viscous, and I
        had not added enough oil or boiled it for too long.</p>

    <p>Roubo’s instructions for varnishing metal with a brush offer one other
        possible clarification of (and solution to) this problem. Moreover, they
        illustrate that producing a smooth varnish was a common practical
        problem. After having outlined the process of how to prepare the
        “Varnish suitable to varnish and gild copper and other metals” and the
        method of heating the metal pieces, Roubo explains how to apply the
        varnish:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>then one puts the varnish in a small vase, in which one dips a brush
            of very soft badger hairs, and after having wiped it a little on the
            edge of the vase, one swiftly carries it over to the piece [of
            metal] without leaning on it too much. One has to do it rather
            quickly so that the <em>reprises</em> do not appear, and there are
            no waves or marks on the varnished piece.<a href="#fn39"
               class="footnote-ref"
               id="fnref39"
               role="doc-noteref"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>That such “waves” or “marks” were
        undesirable is shown by the fact that Roubo also describes a method for
        removing them, in case they were still visible in the varnished piece.<a
           href="#fn40"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref40"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>40</sup></a> In light of Roubo’s
        instructions, I may have used the wrong brush, been too slow in applying
        the varnish, or exerted too much pressure (or a combination of all
        three).</p>
    <p>Although repeated testing might help identify the cause of the problem,
        my struggle to produce a smooth varnish coat vividly illustrated an
        important characteristic of how-to recipes—the omission of important
        steps. In Ms. Fr. 640, this might suggest that the author-practitioner
        was not familiar with potential problems in making or applying black
        varnishes, or that he assumed enough basic knowledge or embodied
        expertise in his readers to adjust accordingly. My practical struggles,
        rather than close reading or textual research alone, provided insight
        into what kinds of knowledge and skills it took to varnish a sword
        guard.</p>
    <h2 id="varnishing-different-types-of-metal">Varnishing different types of
        metal </h2>
    <p>In the previous section I discussed the importance of mastering the
        heating of metal as well as the skilled use of tools to the production
        of a smooth, shiny, black varnish. This section will argue it also
        required understanding of how to heat <em>different types</em> of metal.
    </p>
    <p>The sword guard I reconstructed consisted of two separately made pieces
        that were joined together at the center by rivets (<i><u>Fig. 37</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 38</u></i>, and <i><u>Fig. 39</u></i>). These parts were
        made of two different types of metal of varying degrees of thickness.
        The clam or shell shape was rather thin (16 gage) made of 1050 modern
        mild steel, cold-worked (that is, not heat-treated) and unpolished.<a
           href="#fn41"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref41"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>41</sup></a> The iron cross guard was
        significantly thicker, heated in a forge several times, and roughly
        polished. These differences in thickness had important consequences for
        the heat treatment and varnishing process. Whereas the thin steel clam
        swiftly turned from golden to blue, it took much longer for the iron
        cross guard to reach the desired temperature for varnishing—even with
        the intense heat of the blow torch.</p>

    <p>While the thin clam was quickly heated, this caused problems when
        applying the varnish. Even before it had stopped smoking, the varnish
        began to blister and scale off and some parts of the clam started to
        show the metal underneath (<i><u>Fig. 40</u></i>). Unlike the results of
        trials one and two, the varnish in this fourth experiment turned black,
        but its finish was highly irregular and quite rough. By contrast, when I
        varnished the thick iron bar, its black surface appeared more uniform
        than that of the clam (<i><u>Fig. 41</u></i>). According to Jeff Wasson,
        this might be because thick metal, although taking longer to reach a
        high temperature, retains heat and cools more slowly, which might have
        been advantageous to the process of varnishing.<a href="#fn42"

    <p>That solving (or preventing) this problem was a matter of experience, and
        required skill and knowledge of how best to heat metal of varying
        degrees of thickness, can be shown by comparing the finish of my
        varnished test plate from trial three (<i><u>Fig. 42</u></i>) with that
        of the varnished guard (trial four) (Fig. 40). It was because of my
        failure in trial three to produce a smooth black surface that I realized
        I should probably keep the metal plate further away from the heat
        source, reduce the length of the heating process, and turn off the blow
        torch perhaps even before the varnish stopped smoking. I then tried to
        put these insights into practice in trial four, when I varnished the
        guard. Even though the surface of the varnished guard looked less
        blistered than that of my test plate from trial three, it was still
        irregular and parts of the varnish had nevertheless been burned off.</p>

    <p>My struggles revealed that varnishing a sword guard was not—as I thought
        when reading the instructions—a procedure of simply heating your metal
        and applying the varnish. Rather it was a complex process that required
        highly specific knowledge about heating metal: the proper heat source,
        the appropriate length of time to heat the metal (both prior to and
        after varnishing), how far to hold the metal from the heat, and how
        different types of metal and the varnishes applied to them respond
        differently to heat. While all such components are necessary, the
        essential factor to successfully produce a smooth, lustrous, black
        varnish is to combine all that knowledge and their corresponding actions
        through skilled practice that can only be attained through repeated
        experience.</p>
    <h2 id="varnishing-different-metal-shapes">Varnishing different metal shapes
    </h2>
    <p>The heating of the sword guard, with its peculiar form, also raised
        important questions and posed problems that had not arisen when I heated
        the metal sheets. Unlike the relatively flat test plates, the sword
        guard was more three-dimensional: it consisted of a hollow or curved
        clam and a flat iron cross guard (Fig. 37, Fig. 38, and Fig. 39). Even
        before the start of my final reconstruction, it was clear that it would
        be problematic, if not impossible, to heat and varnish the various
        surface areas of this complex structure simultaneously and evenly—a
        factor which had proven key to producing a smooth black finish. One of
        the questions this process thus raised was how artisans would have
        heated their sword guards, as the author-practitioner instructs on fol.
        <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/4v/f/4v/tl"><u>4v</u></a>
        “over a low charcoal fire.” The use of tongs proved problematic: the
        weight of the guard made it difficult to hold at a specific angle;
        gravity kept pulling it down, making it harder to heat the metal evenly
        and effectively. While I ultimately managed to heat and varnish half of
        the guard (one side of the clam and one side of the cross bar) by
        locking it into place with a clamp (Fig. 26), this process still
        required tremendous control over my wrist and arm—and thus bodily
        strength and dexterity—to hold up the guard and facilitate the heating
        process.</p>
    <p>As my reconstructions showed, it was crucial to heat the metal evenly in
        order to produce a smooth black varnish. Similarly, as noted above,
        Roubo warned his readers to “observ[e] that [a metal piece you want to
        varnish] is heated evenly everywhere.”<a href="#fn43"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref43"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>43</sup></a> The tongs hamper this process,
        as illustrated by <i><u>Fig. 43</u></i> and <i><u>Fig. 44</u></i>, where
        the differences in color surrounding the tongs indicate that the metal
        was not heated evenly. It is unlikely tongs would have been used,
        however this leaves open the question of how artisans could have held
        the armor over the heat and painted on the varnish. A closer look at the
        meaning of <em>foeu legier de charbons</em> (low charcoal fire) in the
        recipe on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/4v/f/4v/tl"><u>4v</u></a>,
        might help answer this question. To heat and varnish the guard, the
        author-practitioner instructs the reader to “place your iron over a low
        charcoal fire.” From a modern perspective, we might interpret “fire”
        here as indicating flames. However, it would have been difficult for
        artisans to control the flow of heat from such a fire and direct it
        toward the metal, especially with flames moving in all directions.
        Accordingly, “charcoal fire” cannot mean fire of flames. Roubo and
        Jousse support this claim, as both instruct their readers to use either
        hot steel or ashes (<em>cendres chauldes</em>), as opposed to a flaming
        fire to heat, color, and varnish metal. Based on this textual evidence
        and my practical experience, I argue that the “charcoal fire” on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/4v/f/4v/tl"><u>4v</u></a>
        is equivalent to but not identical to hot steel or ashes.</p>

    <p>While hot ashes are easily imagined, hot steel might require some
        explanation. The anonymous author of <em>Von Stahel und Eysen</em>, a
        German booklet on metallurgy, published in 1532 “for all armorers,
        goldsmiths, silversmiths, engravers of seals and dies, and all other
        skilled artisans who use steel and iron,” describes such an equivalent
        in a recipe for softening iron: “take the piece that is too hard and
        carefully hold it over <em>glowing charcoal</em> until it has become
        hot. Rub it with tallow and let the tallow dry away on it over the
        <em>heat</em>; it will then acquire the correct hardness.”<a

    <p>Based on these examples I would argue that by “place your iron over a low
        charcoal fire,” the author-practitioner means over <em>glowing</em>
        charcoal. The <em>legier</em> in <em>foeu legier de charbons</em> may
        refer to the intensity of the heat source and imply that the charcoal
        was still glowing but no longer red-hot—and thus of a low, but still
        sufficient heat (compare the color of the metal in <i><u>Fig. 46</u></i> with that in <i><u>Fig. 47</u></i>).</p>

    <p>One problem remains: the means to support a sword guard over a glowing
        charcoal fire. Whereas Roubo instructs his readers to place the metal
        directly onto the heat source (in this case, the hot steel plate), the
        author-practitioner, advises the reader not to do so in his recipe
        “Yellow varnish” on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/96v/f/96v/tl"><u>96v</u></a>,
        which resembles “Black varnish for sword guard” in its method of
        application:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>One whitens very strongly &amp; one cleans the guards well. Next, one
            applies walnut <del>olive</del> oil all over them with a feather
            while they are cold, and next turns them over a good charcoal fire
            that is on the furbishers’ furnace, <em>without them touching the
                charcoal or the ash</em>. And when they do not smoke anymore, it
            is done.<a href="#fn45"
               class="footnote-ref"
               id="fnref45"
               role="doc-noteref"><sup>45</sup></a></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>My reconstruction showed that too much
        direct heat was detrimental to the varnishing process and caused the
        varnish to blister, supporting the advice of the author-practitioner.
        Although this practical problem seems to imply that tongs (or other
        instruments) might still be required to hold the guard over glowing
        charcoal (as opposed to placing it on top as Roubo suggests), the
        example of the Italian metallurgist Vannoccio Biringuccio
        (c.1480–c.1539) shows that this could be done without tools. In
        describing a method of making steel in his <em>De la Pirotechnia</em>
        (1540), Biringuccio explains a technique in which an “empty space is
        filled with charcoal and around it is made a circle of stones or other
        soft rocks which hold up the broken iron [that one wants to melt].”<a
           href="#fn46"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref46"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>46</sup></a> Although Biringuccio is not
        concerned with heating metal for the purpose of varnishing, it is
        nevertheless likely that armor makers would have used a similar method
        to heat and varnish guards, i.e., by resting them on stones or bricks
        encircling glowing charcoal. Such a method would probably also help
        isolate or contain the heat radiating off the charcoal and direct it
        upwards (and thus control it). While such a method may have worked for
        heating a sword guard with a complex shape, it still seems puzzling to
        the inexperienced reconstructor how artisans would have varnished guards
        with an even more complex shape.</p>
    <p>The recipe “Black varnish without fire, without disassembling the
        harnesses or removing the bands from trunks,” also on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/4v/f/4v/tl"><u>4v</u></a>,
        provides a possible answer to this question. As the title of this entry
        suggests, artisans might have varnished multi-shaped sword guards by
        disassembling them first, removing the rivets that joined them, and then
        heating and varnishing the various pieces of metal separately. However,
        the phrasing of the title also suggests that such taking apart of armor
        would have been problematic—perhaps because it was time consuming and
        difficult to put armor back together after it had been varnished—thus
        cold varnishes might have been a useful alternative because they could
        be applied more easily, without disassembling anything. Indeed, the fact
        that furbishers would varnish armor after it had already been assembled
        suggests it might have served as a maintenance technique and that
        varnishing could be repeated as needed. Roubo’s statement that “if at
        any time one would want to varnish pieces which, because of their form
        or any other reason, could not be heated, one would varnish them cold,”
        solves the problem of how to heat complex shapes.<a href="#fn47"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref47"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>47</sup></a></p>
    <p>Cold varnish raises questions of how and to what extent fire affects the
        properties of a varnish, especially since, as we saw in the example of
        Jousse, heat caused a material like animal horn to “[attach] itself to
        the iron.”<a href="#fn48"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref48"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>48</sup></a> By contrast, it seems that the
        cold varnish would form a layer of paint sitting on top rather than
        attaching to the metal. Do the different ways in which these hot and

        Insights from reconstruction: possible purposes of the “black varnish
        for sword guard”</h2>
    <p>A steel plate from trial two, which was half-varnished, heated in the
        cast iron pan, and ended up with a dark brown finish, was subjected to a
        rust test by placing it outside in the rain for three days (<i><u>Fig. 48</u></i>). While the uncovered metal had begun to corrode and
        showed rust stains, the varnish held up in the rain and appears to have
        protected the metal underneath (Compare <i><u>Fig. 49</u></i> and <i><u>Fig. 50</u></i>). Although more experiments are needed—especially
        with the black varnish produced in trial four—this outcome certainly
        adds weight to the hypothesis that the varnish was used to protect metal
        from rusting.</p>

        <strong>Conclusion</strong>
    </h2>
    <p>This essay has explored the purpose, making, and application of the
        “black varnish for sword guard, bands for trunks, etc” described in Ms.
        Fr. 640. Textual research shows that this recipe was not unique, and
        that black varnishes for metal were used beyond the context of armor as
        well. Primary sources suggest that “black varnish for sword guard” could
        have been used as an etching ground, a rust-protection coat, and a
        finish to impart luster and brilliance to armor. My reconstruction gives
        support to the last two hypotheses, but additional reconstructions are
        needed to test the black varnish of Ms. Fr. 640 as an etching ground.
        Furthermore, my experiments have shown that the wheat grains served as
        colorants, have helped clarify the meaning of <em>sec</em> (dry; i.e.,
        not tacky), and provided proof of concept for the indication “when you
        see that it no longer smokes, it is done and your varnish is dry.”
        Further research, however, is needed to determine the precise meaning
        and composition of the ingredient “black pitch” and the meaning and
        purposes of <em>desgraisser</em> (to degrease) in the recipe. Additional
        reconstructions, using glowing charcoal or charcoal fire for instance,
        could also help clarify the meaning of <em>foeu legier de charbons</em>
        (low charcoal fire) on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/4v/f/4v/tl"><u>4v</u></a>.<a
           href="#fn49"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref49"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>49</sup></a></p>
    <p>Above all, my reconstructions show that success (or failure) to make a
        smooth, shiny, black varnish cannot be reduced to a single
        component—that is, ingredients, materials, tools, or heat. Each of these
        components, when used in the right way and to the right degree, could
        contribute to the finished character of the varnish. For example,
        although heat could potentially help blacken the varnish, “dry” it, and
        make it smooth and shiny, this outcome seems to have depended just as
        much on the inclusion of oil, wheat grains, and black pitch. Moreover,
        insufficient heat left the varnish brown and tacky, while too much and
        too direct heat caused it to scale off. More direct heat, however, was
        needed to varnish thick metal, whereas thinner plates had to be heated
        and varnished with more care. Similarly, although a brush made it easier
        to apply the varnish, the process of application also depended on the
        temperature of the metal. Even with sufficient heat, the application
        could leave brush strokes if the varnish was applied too slowly or with
        too much pressure.</p>
    <p>In other words, my reconstruction demonstrated that making a smooth,
        shiny, black varnish for sword guards was not a straightforward, linear
        accumulation of steps consisting simply of mixing ingredients, adding
        heat, and applying a liquid onto metal. Rather, it was the outcome of a
        complex set of techniques and practiced actions that had to converge in
        just the right way. Making “black varnish for sword guard” and applying
        it to armor depended as much on the properties of the ingredients as on
        an artisan’s knowledge of the requisite heat, metals, and tools as well
        as the skill to work with them.</p>

                    and uses almost the exact same words as Jousse to describe

                    not include the furbisher’s varnish, which Jousse discusses
                    straight after this varnish. Whether Félibien copied these

                    this varnish demonstrates the interest among late

                <p>Another example from Pacheco, moreover, illustrates that
                    early modern artisans occasionally employed garlic, or more
                    specifically, its color, as a temperature or time indicator.
                    Pacheco claimed that in preparing drying oil, the liquid
                    should boil “until the garlic was burnt or toasted,”
                    Merrifield, <em>Medieval and Renaissance Treatise</em>s,
                    237. Several recipes mentioned in Tingry’s work on the
                    preparation and application of varnishes also suggest to
                    take a garlic clove’s brown color as a sign that the oil was
                    ready; see Tingry, <em>Varnisher's Guide</em>, 80, 84.
                    However, since the author-practitioner uses hours (and
                    fractions of them) to indicate for how long one should boil
                    the oil, it seems unlikely that the garlic in this recipe
                    was intended as a measure of time (or temperature) alone.<a

                    For reasons of time and because modern linseed oil has
                    already been rid of fatty acids, I decided to skip the
                    “degreasing” process which consists of adding garlic, hog’s
                    fennel, and bread crusts to the linseed oil and bringing
                    this mixture to a boil. It would nevertheless be interesting
                    to reconstruct the “black varnish for sword guard” again and
                    include this step to test if my assumption was correct.<a

                <p>My initial plan was to reconstruct and compare the “black
                    varnish for sword guard” to the variation described in the
                    margin of fol. <a

                    “for excellent black varnish, add two or three paternoster
                    beads of jet among the rest.” However, just as the
                    author-practitioner had warned his readers, the oil
                    auto-ignited in the process of preparing the second recipe
                    with jet, and I had to abort this reconstruction. On fol. <a

                    the author-practitioner writes: “It is dangerous if the fire
                    catches within, if it goes over the top, and is hard to
                    extinguish. Make this therefore in a courtyard or an open
                    space.” Similarly, Della Porta and Tingry also warned
                    readers about the risks of working with hot oil. See Della
                    Porta, <em>Natural Magick</em>, 265; and Tingry,

                <p>Sensory techniques, and especially seeing the metal change
                    color, is also key in modern blacksmithing. One way to shape
                    and add volume to metal is by heating it in a forge until it
                    becomes red-hot, or incandescent, and then hammering it,
                    which can be done for as long as your piece is red. Once the
                    metal is no longer red and has returned to its original
                    color, you need to stop hammering (and reheat if needed).
                    Seeing the metal change color is thus crucial.<a

                <p>The gage (also spelled gauge) indicates the thickness of the
                    steel. The higher the number, the thinner the metal, the
                    lower the number, the thicker the metal. Cold-worked means
                    that the metal is shaped and given volume—through hammering,
                    dishing and planishing—without the use of heat. You can also
                    shape and add volume to metal by first heating it in a forge
                    (or fire) and then hammering it. For more, see Camps,

                <p>An early nineteenth-century source mentioned in
                    Paulin-Désormaux's <em>Manuel de l'armurier</em> may be
                    useful for subsequent reconstructions. It discusses a way to
                    renew the brilliant quality of Persian swords (“commonly
                    called damascus blades”) and to remove their yellowish tint
                    (which Désormaux translated as rust stains (<em>taches de
                        rouille</em>)). The source discusses the use of sensory
                    techniques, the use of charcoal to heat metal, the
                    application of fat and oil to swords, the importance of even
                    heating and smoke, and an indication of when the sword must
                    be taken off the fire. See S. Barker, <em>The Asiatic
