        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <div>
            <p>Recipes for the making of gemstones appear in many texts and
                manuscripts from at least the seventh century BCE onward.
                Procedures to make gemstones typically involve the application
                of color to a transparent material, cracking a crystal to allow
                color to penetrate it, or the making of colored glass. While
                there are several entries in Ms. Fr. 640 for imitating and/or
                making use of precious and semi-precious stones, the nine
                recipes for <em>pierrerie</em> (gemstones) from fol. <a
                   href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/100r/f/100r/tl"><u>100r</u></a>
                to fol. <a

                form a remarkably cohesive unit that appears to show the
                author-practitioner at work, gathering information from others,
                experimenting himself, and hypothesizing about how to overcome
                his failure. This essay compares his methods to other
                contemporary texts and considers whether these nine recipes
                provide clues to the author-practitioner’s identity.</p>

    <h2 id="nine-recipes-for-gemstones">Nine Recipes for Gemstones</h2>
    <p>Midway through fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/100r/f/100r/tl"><u>100r</u></a>
        in BnF Ms. Fr. 640, a remarkable set of nine entries begins with the
        heading “<em>Pierrerie</em>,” or “Gemstones.” This title is surprising
        because the gemstones in the following entries all turn out to be made
        of glass, thus one might reasonably expect that this title would instead
        read “Counterfeit gemstones,” especially because Ms. Fr. 640 contains
        recipes for imitation coral (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/3r/f/3r/tl"><u>3r</u></a>)
        and imitation jasper (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/10r/f/10r/tl"><u>10r</u></a>),
        both called “counterfeit” (<em>contrefaict</em>). This seeming
        equivalency of authentic and “counterfeit” in the “gemstone” entries is
        just one of the intriguing puzzles of these nine entries.</p>
    <p>The puzzling nature of this group of entries is heightened in the first
        recipe on fol. 100r entitled “Gemstones,” which deals solely with the
        tools needed to start:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Gemstones</p>
        <p>You need to pestle your materials in a mortar of thick glass &amp;
            encased &amp; stuck with mastic into another mortar of wood, in
            order that it does not break. This can serve for perfumers. &amp;
            <em>
                <del>la t</del>
            </em> the pestle, also of glass.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>A note in the left margin reiterates and
        emphasizes that these tools are all of glass: “Mortar of glass and slab
        of glass for grinding.”</p>
    <p>Two recipes follow this initial entry about <em>pierrerie</em> on fol.
        100r: the first for “Vitrified saltpeter” (potassium nitrate), which the
        author-practitioner appears to see as a normal ingredient in glass
        making to produce large panes of “glass very clear &amp; white &amp;
        clean.” After this follows a recipe for applying this mixture to both
        sides of glass windows to block direct sunlight (apparently for creating
        opaque but translucent windows, perhaps what today we call “frosted
        glass”). This suggests that the author-practitioner is grouping recipes
        for making gemstones within a broader category of glass processes.</p>
    <p>Turning the page to fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/100v/f/100v/tl"><u>100v</u></a>,
        this suggestion is confirmed by the ingredients listed for the two
        following gemstones in the grouping, emeralds and rubies, which are made
        with the basic components of glass making—quartz, red lead (minium), and
        alkali salt:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Take white pebbles that are found by the rivers &amp; among the sand
            bank &amp; paths, which are somewhat transparent, &amp; if they are
            perfectly transparent it will be better. If not, use the best &amp;
            whitest that you can. Calcine them three or 4 times in your <em>four
                à vent</em>, &amp; extinguish them in water or vinegar. Next,
            take a ℥ [ounce] of them and pestle them [...] and grind them until
            they become very fine &amp; soft powder [...]. At that time, on your
            ℥ [ounce] of pebbles, put in three ℥ [ounces] of good minium, not
            adulterated by brick &amp; anything else, and grind everything
            together again very well in a bronze mortar. And on all of this, put
            in a <em>gros</em>
            <del><sup>pour ℥</sup></del> of <em>sel de verre</em>; &amp; some
            &amp; the common people put in <em>
                <del>e</del>
            </em> sandiver that they find at the glassmakers’ or apothecaries’.
            But alkali salt, as you know, is better.
        </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>After this first recipe on fol. 100v—an entry for making emeralds
        entitled “<em>Pierrerie</em>” but labeled in the left margin
        “<em>Esmeraulde</em>” (“<em>Emerald</em>”)—the next recipe in the
        grouping deals with ruby making: “For ruby take gold leaf” (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/100v/f/100v/tl"><u>100v</u></a>–<a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/101r/f/101r/tl"><u>101r</u></a>).
        Subsequently, a recipe for topaz affirms that all the gemstone recipes
        start with those same ingredients of glass making: “The same dose is
        observed for all gemstones, namely one weight of calcined pebbles on
        three of minium” (fol. 101r). This topaz recipe further builds on the
        previous two recipes for emeralds and rubies by noting similarities and
        differences in the temperatures and heating times. Following topaz,
        comes an entry, “Salt for melting” (fol. 101r–v), that at first seems an
        outlier among the gemstones because it is a flux for purifying metals
        and making them “run marvellously” (fol. 101r). But its place within
        this recipe group is clarified when the author-practitioner gives
        instructions for processing it further to make “a substance white, hard
        &amp; even, like alabaster, with which you will be able to cast medals
        which will resemble marble” (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/101v/f/101v/tl"><u>101v</u></a>).
        This recipe group ends on fol. 101v with a recipe for jacinth that “is
        made like ruby, with gold, but one does not need such a great fire,” and
        then a final recipe for topaz.</p>
    <p>This is an unusual group of recipes for multiple reasons: first, as
        noted, because the author-practitioner apparently seems to regard them
        all as related to glass making but does not call them “counterfeit” (see
        below). Second, all nine entries clearly form an unusually cohesive—for
        Ms. Fr. 640—and apparently temporally-related unit. They refer to each
        other, each one building on that before it, for example, by noting
        differences in mortar and pestle types (copper for emerald, glass for
        ruby, iron or steel for topaz), variations in coloring substance (copper
        for emerald—supplied by the mortar grinding; gold leaf for ruby; and
        pumice for topaz), and different levels and lengths of heating (the same
        for emerald and topaz, and much higher and longer for ruby). They all
        use the same equipment, including a furnace identified as a <em>four à
            vent</em>, and illustrated in the margin on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/100v/f/100v/tl"><u>100v</u></a>,
        with the added note that “one needs to reheat crucibles before putting
        in materials, and put them in the <em>fornaise</em> or <em>four à
            vent</em> before making &amp; increasing the fire” (<i><u>Fig. 1</u></i>).<a href="#fn1"

    <h2 id="first-and-second-hand-experience">First and Second Hand Experience
    </h2>
    <p>In all these recipes, the author-practitioner has added copious marginal
        notes that refer to information he collected from others, as in his
        notes on the ruby recipe: “some say that, mixing the gold with the
        pebbles and the saltpeter, it makes the color of a peach tree,” while
        “others say that it is necessary that the gold be cemented several
        times, then beaten into leaf” (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/100v/f/100v/tl"><u>100v</u></a>),
        and “one holds that rubified antimony makes jacinth” (<a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/101v/f/101v/tl"><u>101v</u></a>).
        But other marginal notes clearly reference his own experience in heating
        times (emeralds are “made in an hour &amp; a half”) and heating levels,
        including on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/101r/f/101r/tl"><u>101r</u></a>,
        where his advice is conveyed in a small sketch of the arrangement of
        tiles that notes, “if you need greater heat, <em>
            <del>plie</del>
        </em> put, on the edge of the opening of the glowing furnace, tiles, one
        against the other, for making the heat reverberate” (<i><u>Fig. 2</u></i>).</p>

    <p>The recipes themselves even seem to be written in something like the
        order in which the author-practitioner experimented, and we can
        speculate on the process that led to this set of recipes: he started by
        assembling tools, listing the glass mortar and pestle of the first
        “<em>Pierrerie</em>” entry (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/100r/f/100r/tl"><u>100r</u></a>),
        then began by experimenting with making emeralds, perhaps an easy recipe
        because even “the common people make emeralds &amp; cast in sand” (fol.
        <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/100v/f/100v/tl"><u>100v</u></a>).
        He then tried rubies, and failed: “The first experience that I made of
        it, it only returned a yellow mass, as is vitrified minium alone, &amp;
        some grains of gold in a mass at the bottom,” reminding himself at the
        end of this entry to “try cemented gold and accompanied with antimony”
        (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/101r/f/101r/tl"><u>101r</u></a>),
        and perhaps stopping at that point to record what “some” and “others”
        say about making rubies, as quoted above. He then went on to topaz,
        comparing it to heating times and temperatures for both emeralds and
        rubies, noting from his success with topaz that “The ruby <em>
            <del>en</del>
        </em> wants more time &amp; more fire &amp; colored with gold leaf. I
        believe that pumice stone or firestone for the ruby would be better”
        (fol. 101r). Following this, the “Jacinth” entry (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/101v/f/101v/tl"><u>101v</u></a>)
        appears simply to furnish him with another opportunity to mull over his
        failure with rubies:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Jacinth</p>
        <p>Is made like ruby, with gold, but one does not need such a great
            fire. The ruby wants fire for a whole day, and if it does not have
            enough fire, it will only have red veins .</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>Finally, he ends by recounting in detail
        his own first hand experience in the last topaz recipe on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/101v/f/101v/tl"><u>101v</u></a>:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>I melted one part of pumice stone, calcined &amp; pulverized, <em>
                <del>&amp; tr</del>
            </em> with three parts of minium, and the stone pulverized in a
            steel <em>
                <del>ver f</del>
            </em> mortar. It <sup>returned</sup> me a very beautiful yellow
            without any grains, more yellow than any others. It is true that it
            was well saturated with color. I believe it would be better to <em>
                <del>le</del>
            </em> pulverize the pumice in a glass mortar, because it &amp; the
            minium make enough yellow by themselves. It returned to me a mass,
            the top a beautiful yellow, as was said, the bottom like firestone,
            without transparency. With which, by mixing other</p>

        about making and using precious and semi-precious stones show that the

        both entitled “Sapphire” on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/38r/f/38r/tl"><u>38r</u></a>
        contain remarkably detailed and specialist knowledge. The first refers
        to a known and identifiable object—the “Screen of Charlemagne,” as it is
        called, in the treasure of Saint Denis—about which the
        author-practitioner adds, “I have a white one [sapphire] that seems to
        be rough &amp; pierced, and is spotted all over with blue blemishes. I
        am of the opinion that these are artificial &amp; that they are of
        taffer or very clear <em>esmail azuré</em> melted entirely on the
        sapphire.” The second sapphire entry on fol. 38r provides rich detail
        about the production of imitation sapphires:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Stone cutters sometimes choose old pieces of antique glass in church
            windows, which are much thicker than those of today &amp; are of
            more lively colors. If it is for <em>
                <del>souf</del>
            </em> sapphire, they choose beautiful blue &amp; from such a place
            that there are no <del>pieces</del> <sup>grains</sup>, if it is
            possible. And having cut it in squares with emery, they cut it in
            bevel &amp; polish it. And in this manner, they counterfeit very
            beautiful sapphires. The old <em>esmail d’azur</em> for silver
            verging on aquamarine was very appropriate for counterfeiting
            sapphires, but it is scarcely found. One counterfeits aquamarines
            with white glass, but they take it from the bottom of the glass.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>The level of detail in this observation
        seems likely to be specialist knowledge.</p>
    <p>Similarly, the entry for “Counterfeit diamonds put in a work” (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/138v/f/138v/tl"><u>138v</u></a>)
        appears to be an expert account of mounting an (imitation) gem, using
        the appropriate tools:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Give a light coat on the inside of the setting with black modeling
            wax, then anoint the inside, thus waxed, with wheat oil, &amp; then
            powder this with lamp smoke, for it is necessary that <em>
                <del>ceste</del>
            </em> its color not have luster for false stones. This done, set in
            your stone <del>&amp; then</del> with a bit of wax, then, with a
            steel point &amp; a small finishing hammer, join the edge of the
            setting to the stone in order that daylight does not enter in. But
            keep from knocking the stone, which would break.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>Finally, in an entry for making an
        imitation cornaline, “For whitening enilanroc” (i.e., “cornaline”
        written backwards) on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/12v/f/12v/tl"><u>12v</u></a>,
        the author-practitioner mentions “my goldsmith’s forge.”</p>
    <p>The detailed, specific, and apparently expert knowledge (and equipment),
        as well as the extensive first hand testimony and experimentation
        displayed in the imitation gemstone entries in Ms. Fr. 640 can be
        brought into connection with the author-practitioner’s comments about
        polishing, engraving, and setting genuine gemstones, which also appear
        to be based in expert practice.<a href="#fn4"

           role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> The author-practitioner’s remarks
        about authentic and imitation gemstones can be compared to the
        intriguing activities of a Toulouse goldsmith, Raymond Masse (fl.
        1585–1631), who bought precious stones from a merchant in Breisach
        (“Brissac”), and who was commissioned to make two counterfeit sapphires
        by Philippe de Béthune’s niece, Louise. Although no link between Masse
        and the anonymous author-practitioner can be established, the
        similarities are quite suggestive.<a href="#fn5"

    <p>The author-practitioner appears to possess expertise and a deep interest
        not only in casting medals, sculpture, and delicate lifecasts, but also
        in precious stones. Both these interests are consonant with the trade of
        goldsmithing. While the question of the author-practitioner’s identity
        cannot be settled here, the entries for <em>pierrerie</em> on fols.
        100r–101v raise many questions more generally about gemstone making in
        the sixteenth century, how widespread such knowledge was, and where, if
        he was not a goldsmith himself, the author-practitioner might have
        learned such knowledge.</p>

    <p>Seneca (4 BCE–65 CE) provides the first Roman written evidence of the
        practice of gemstone imitation in his <em>Moral epistles to
            Lucilius</em>, explaining that pebbles were boiled to resemble
        emerald (<em>smaragdus</em>). Shortly thereafter, Pliny the Elder (23–79
        CE) lists three methods for making imitation gemstones: glass
        imitations, paste imitations, and imitations made by coloring
        transparent minerals, such as crystal.<a href="#fn9"

        gold) to produce imitation jewels.</p>
    <p>The Stockholm Papyrus of 200–300 CE contains over seventy recipes for the

        including English, as <em>Natural Magick</em>, in 1659), “Of

        “<em>Pierrerie</em>” on fol. 100v in Ms. Fr. 640, Della Porta calls for
        “round pebbles found by river sides” in a recipe for “How Flint, or
        Crystal is to be prepared, and how Pastils are boiled:”</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>The matter of which Gems are made, is either Crystal or Flint, from
            whence we strike fire, or round pebbles found by river sides: those
            are the best which are taken up by the river Thames, white, clear,
            and of the bigness of an egge; for of those are made best
            counterfeit Gemms, though all will serve in some sort. Some think
            that Crystal is the best for this purpose, because of the brightness
            and transparency of it; but they are deceived. The way of making
            Gems, is this: Take river pebbles and put them into a fornace, in
            that place where the retorted flame is most intense; when they are
            red hot, take them out and fling them into water: then dry them, and
            powder them in a mortar, or a hand-mill, until they are very fine;
            put them into a wide-mouthed vessel, full of rain water, and shake
            it well in your hands, for so the finest part will rise to the top,
            and the grossest will settle to the bottom: to that which swims at
            top pour fresh water, and stir the dust again: and do this
            oftentimes, until the gross part be quite separated and sunk down.
            Then take out the water, and let it settle, and in the bottom there
            will lie a certain slimy matter; gather together, and reserve the
            refined powder. But whil’st the stone is ground, both the morter and
            the mill will lose somewhat of themselves, which being mixt with the
            powder will soul [soil] the Gem: wherefore it will be worth the
            labor to wash that away: to which end, let water be often poured
            into the lavel, and stirred about; the dust of the morter will rise
            to the top, by reason of its levity, and the powder of the pebbles
            will retire to the bottom by reason of its weight; skim the lavel,
            and separate them with a spoon, till all that sandy and black dust
            be taken off; then strain out the water, and reserve the powder dry.
            These being done, we must teach [<em>How pastils are boiled</em>].<a

    <p>The evidence of jewels such as those found in the Cheapside Hoard, in
        combination with the fact that the author-practitioner gave the title of
        <em>Pierrerie</em> (Gemstones) to a series of processes he clearly
        associated with glass making, raises the question of whether the
        distinctly different values placed today on a mined natural gemstone and
        one made by human artifice existed in sixteenth-century Europe. Indeed,
        there is substantial evidence to suggest that this difference in
        perceived value is more of a concern today than it was then. As
        explained in other essays in this edition, “counterfeit” materials such
        as the coral and jasper in Ms. Fr. 640 were not necessarily intended to
        deceive; rather, they could delight their viewers as a virtuosic
        performance of human artifice. These “counterfeits” were seen both to

    <p>Although many lapidary texts present methods for testing the authenticity
        of gems, genuine and imitation jewels were consistently mounted
        alongside each other in precious objects from at least the fifth
        century, as found in the Carolingian altar of Saint Ambrose (ca. 800) in
        Milan (<i><u>Fig. 5</u></i>). According to historian Anne-Françoise
        Cannella, the majority of medieval reliquaries, book covers, and
        sumptuous objects housed in church treasuries and museums show
        <em>pierrerie</em> (gemstones) and <em>verroterie</em> (glass beads or
        gems) employed simultaneously.<a href="#fn27"

        Holy Roman Emperor Charles V (1500–1558) is recorded as having a
        counterfeit emerald within each of its thirteen finials, a fact that was
        known to him at the time.<a href="#fn28"

                and imitation stones (primarily doublets and glass imitations)
                set in gold. Historian Anne-Françoise Cannella argues that the
                co-appearance of naturally occurring and man-made precious
                stones on this altar is not a case of deception or trickery but
                evidence that both were seen as equally worthy of display.

    <p>All this suggests that the perception of the value of authentic and
        imitation gemstones in the author-practitioner’s lifetime may not have
        been as polarized as it is today. The prophylactic powers associated
        with jewels were generally associated with color, so, as suggested by
        Cannella, it is possible that colored glass was perceived as possessing
        the same talismanic and/or medicinal value as a natural stone of the
        same color.<a href="#fn29"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref29"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a> A well-colored, lustrous, and
        translucent glass jewel may have been just as desirable as a natural
        stone in representing the power of human art to create something that
        possessed valuable properties found in nature, and the knowledge
        accumulated in producing that object could be essential in understanding
        natural processes more generally. A comprehensive study of jewelry and
        jeweled objects to test the authenticity of the gemstones used in these
        objects might find as many imitation jewels as genuine gemstones. In
        light of these points, we might rethink the value we place on the
        authenticity of materials today, as it may be hindering our recognition
        of the significance of imitation and material mimesis in early modern
        art making, and it may be preventing us from fully understanding the
        reception of art objects in their own time.</p>

                <p>Cannella, <em>Gemmes</em>, 120. Evidence suggests that this
                    equivalence in value was established in Babylonian texts
                    about stones, which typically do not make a distinction
                    between what we would see as natural and artificial stones,
                    perhaps understanding them as today we understand
                    “chemically identical” substances such as cinnabar and
                    vermilion (mercury sulfide). Thus, at the dawn of a written
                    corpus on stones and their imitation, the same words were
                    used for natural and human made stones. See Anastasia
                    Amrhein, Claire Fitzgerald, and Elizabeth Knott, eds., <em>A
                        Wonder to Behold: Craftsmanship and the Creation of
                        Babylon’s Ishtar Gate</em> (Princeton: Princeton
                    University Press, 2019). Whether this equivalence between
                    artificial and natural stones was then transmitted via the
                    very long-lasting written corpus of glass recipes bears
                    further investigation.<a href="#fnref29"
