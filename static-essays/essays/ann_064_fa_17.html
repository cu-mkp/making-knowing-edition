            <p>The entry “Stucco for molding” on fol. <a

                describes a method for creating stucco which the
                author-practitioner claims is versatile and inexpensive. This
                essay offers a material-based analysis of the entry, drawing on
                insights from laboratory reconstructions, and a historical
                investigation of ancient and early modern stucco recipes and
                stucco use to better situate the author-practitioner within his
                context. These comparisons reveal that the author-practitioner’s
                recipe, particularly its use of tragacanth gum, is unusual.
                Moreover, the entry highlights the author-practitioner’s
                interest in ornamentation, his focus on using pre-existing
                patterns rather than creating new ones, and his possible
                first-hand experiences of making domestic and ephemeral
                decorative art.</p>

    <p>Stucco is a type of plaster used to coat walls and to create wall and
        ornamental moldings. The entry on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/29r/f/29r/tl"><u>29r</u></a>,
        “Stucco for molding,” describes a process for creating this material and
        provides an opportunity to examine varieties of early modern stucco in
        order to better understand the aims of the author-practitioner. How do
        the materials and techniques detailed on fol. 29r compare to
        contemporaneous recipes for this substance called “stucco?” What do they
        tell us about how the author-practitioner intended to use this material,
        and, finally, do they allow insight into whether he experimented with
        the stucco himself?</p>
    <p>The entry includes more than one set of instructions. The first outlines
        a straightforward process for making stucco from tragacanth gum and rye
        flour, and then molding it. In the main text, the author-practitioner
        warns against using wheat flour, suggesting that rye is better “because
        it is more humid and does not make the paste as brittle.” A marginal
        note on this process (apparently in the same hand, but using different
        ink), however, warns against flour, saying that chalk or ceruse is
        preferable. The next recipe, in the same paragraph, appears to be a
        process for slaking plaster of Paris and allowing it to decompose over a
        period of thirty days, with a note that the resulting compound is
        particularly white. A reconstruction of these four different types of
        stucco—rye flour, wheat flour, chalk, and plaster of Paris, each
        combined with tragacanth gum—can shed light on the author-practitioner’s
        reasons for using or avoiding certain ingredients and whether these
        ingredients affect the intended use. Due to time constraints, the
        thirty-day process was not reconstructed, but future investigations
        might further illuminate this set of instructions.</p>
    <p>Before venturing further, it is necessary to try to distinguish
        “plaster,” “stucco,” “gesso,” and “plaster of Paris.” According to the
        Oxford English Dictionary, plaster is “a soft pliable mixture of sand
        and water with gypsum or lime, spread on walls, ceilings, etc., to form
        a smooth hard surface when dry; a coating or surface of such
        material.”<a href="#fn1"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref1"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> Stucco is “a fine plaster, esp.
        one composed of gypsum and pulverized marble, used for covering walls,
        ceilings, and floors, and for making cornices, mouldings, and other
        decorations.”<a href="#fn2"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref2"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> Gesso is defined as, “Plaster of
        Paris; gypsum; as prepared for use in painting and sculpture.”<a
           href="#fn3"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref3"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> Plaster of Paris is “a hard white
        solid formed from a paste of water and partly dehydrated gypsum, used
        for making sculptures and casts and for immobilizing broken bones;
        (also) the powder or paste from which this is made.”<a href="#fn4"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref4"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> Notably, the definition for
        stucco specifies its use in making decorations, while the definition for
        plaster does not, despite mentioning its “pliable” nature. The
        definition for gesso relies on the definition for plaster. Plaster of
        Paris is specifically made of gypsum, and it is given as a synonym of
        plaster, stucco, and gesso in the extended definitions of all three.
        There seem to be two main types of plaster, lime and gypsum, and they
        can be used in similar ways. “Plaster” seems to be used as a general
        term referring to any material with a base of gypsum or lime.</p>
    <p>Adding to the potential confusion, the four terms are often used
        interchangeably in translations of historical and contemporary recipes,
        though primary source texts sometimes differentiate between gypsum-based
        plasters and lime plasters. This raises the question as to which
        material the author-practitioner referred. Both gypsum-based and
        lime-based plasters are produced by calcining the mined earth, and both
        produce heat when water is added (slaking), implying that they have
        similar physical properties. Both are calcium compounds, which likely
        contributes to their similarities. Plaster of Paris is produced when
        gypsum or limestone is burned, driving off the water. This process is
        called calcination, and it produces a “live” material that undergoes a
        chemical reaction upon contact with water that causes it to set. On fol.
        <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/29r/f/29r/tl"><u>29r</u></a>,
        the author-practitioner mentioned plaster as an ingredient for stucco,
        which implies he was referring to powdered plaster as a component in his
        recipe rather than stucco as a type of plaster.</p>
    <p>The author-practitioner seems to have understood “plaster” as a material
        distinct from stucco, and his various mentions of it and its
        characteristics provide further insight. He distinguishes two types of
        plaster on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/12r/f/12r/tl"><u>12r</u></a>,
        writing, “that from the mountains is greyer, and the one from the region
        of Albi is whiter. ” It is not clear which mountains he is referring to,
        but plaster from Albi is presumably limestone, given that Albi is built
        on a limestone deposit. Similarly, Paris was adjacent to productive
        gypsum mines, which is why plaster of Paris came to be named after this
        city already in the Middle Ages. On fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/41r/f/41r/tl"><u>41r</u></a>,
        in the entry “Sand,” he writes that the sand can be made bindable with,
        among other things, “plaster or calcined alabaster.” Alabaster is a type
        of gypsum. On fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/106r/f/106r/tl"><u>106r</u></a>,
        “Making gold run for casting,” the author-practitioner specifically
        mentions plaster of Paris and describes it as “firm as stone.” It seems,
        therefore, that the author understood the difference between lime
        “plaster,” calcined alabaster, and plaster of Paris, and had access to
        each. Yet the practical and material differences between them are
        unclear. Considering that plaster and calcined alabaster are treated as
        interchangeable on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/41r/f/41r/tl"><u>41r</u></a>,
        it could be that their differences were negligible for the
        author-practitioner’s purposes.</p>
    <p>Given the difficulty of distinguishing between plaster, stucco, and gesso
        in primary sources, and to avoid a lexical quagmire, this essay focuses
        on the material characteristic that seems to have been common to the
        historical uses of all of these terms: early modern texts and recipes
        indicate that the substance (whether “plaster,” “stucco,” “gesso,” or
        “plaster of Paris”) was plastic and malleable, rather than liquid, and
        its surface offered a ground receptive to paint.</p>
    <h2 id="materials-for-stucco">Materials for Stucco </h2>
    <p>Tragacanth gum is the first component of the recipe. It also appears in
        the manuscript in instructions relating to “Dragon’s Blood” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/29v/f/29v/tl"><u>29v</u></a>)
        and “Colors” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/52v/f/52v/tl"><u>52v</u></a>).
        In the entry “Colors,” tragacanth gum is a component of a type of
        varnish which helps to brighten painted colors. The
        author-practitioner’s references to the functions of this ingredient
        indicate that he was likely personally familiar with it.</p>
    <p>Tragacanth gum was a common material in the early modern period, although
        it was spelled in a variety of ways. It is, for instance, “dragagant” in
        Randle Cotgrave’s 1611 dictionary: “Gumme Dragagant, a gummie liquor
        which distills from the root of the Candian shrub, called
        Goats-beard.”<a href="#fn5"

           role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> A natural gum made from the sap
        of a legume plant in the genus <em>Astragalus</em>, tragacanth is native

        was typically dried then ground, and the resulting powder could then be
        rehydrated and made into a mucilaginous jelly. Once in this form, it was
        very versatile: it was used medicinally,<a href="#fn6"

        included in a large eighteenth-century compilation of recipes and

            neu-aufgerichteten und vergrösserten in sechs bücher ...verfasten
            curieusen Kunst- und Werck-Schul</em> (1707).<a href="#fn11"

           id="fnref11"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
    <p>The author-practitioner instructs that the gum must be mixed with water,
        indicating that he began with the tragacanth gum in a powdered or
        otherwise desiccated form. Although he does not mention the specific
        quantities of ingredients in this recipe, he does provide qualitative
        instructions, stating that the gum-water mixture should be “rendered
        like jelly.”<a href="#fn12"

           id="fnref12"

        discovered that watering the tragacanth gum until it resembled modern
        petroleum jelly rendered the best results; it was smoother, more
        elastic, and incorporated well with the powdery main ingredient.</p>
    <p>Rye flour is the second component of this recipe. Flour, like bread,
        seems to be invoked as a versatile ingredient throughout the manuscript,
        often used to describe the desired properties of other materials.<a
           href="#fn13"

        is unique in Ms. Fr. 640 to fol. <a

        suggesting that his use of rye flour was thus not due to its
        availability in his workshop, but rather because it should be employed
        for its specific qualities, and that he was familiar with the various
        properties of different flours. The author-practitioner explains that
        rye flour “is better than wheat because it is more humid and does not
        make the paste as brittle.” Nonetheless, the marginal note of fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/29r/f/29r/tl"><u>29r</u></a>
        implies that he attempted the stucco recipe using flour and found it
        lacking: “Flour is not good in this, but chalk or ceruse is.” He offers
        no explanation for this conclusion.</p>
    <p>Stucco is a versatile material, long in use throughout Europe and beyond.
        Several sources indicate the use of stucco in early modern Italy to
        create temporary structures as well as more permanent installations. In
        1529, Pope Clement VII traveled to Bologna to meet with Emperor Charles
        V, and a Doric-style triumphal arch made of stucco was erected along the
        processional route to the Piazza Maggiore, decorated with scenes from
        the Old Testament.<a href="#fn14"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref14"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> Stucco was also used as a
        sculpting material: Gianlorenzo Bernini created stucco angels for the

    <p>The Roman writer Vitruvius described the attributes of good stucco: it
        should be close-textured, hard, have a polished surface, and allow for
        superb modeling in low and high relief.<a href="#fn16"

        should be of the best quality, and tempered a long time before it is
        required for use, so that if any of it is not burnt enough, the length
        of time taken in slaking it may bring the whole mass to the same
        consistency.”<a href="#fn17"

        the method for achieving an even and fine consistency in the material:
        “the burnt and water-slaked lime was chopped with iron hatchets and
        turned over. This was to be repeated at intervals if necessary until the

    <p>Cennino Cennini provided perhaps the earliest recorded recipe for a

        warm and applied to panels as a priming layer.<a href="#fn25"

        to be better suited for finer work. The basic recipe is the same as that
        for <em>gesso grosso</em>, but it must be kept moist in a large tub for
        at least a month and stirred well every day until “it is practically

    <p>In the sixteenth century, plasterwork in England became so important that
        the craft received royal recognition. In 1501, Henry VII granted a
        charter to the Worshipful Company of Plaisterers of London, which
        essentially recognized them as a guild of artisans, and they were
        granted a coat of arms by Henry VIII.<a href="#fn31"

    <p>Briefly looking outside a European context, a Persian method for the
        preparation of plaster is similar to the one mentioned by the
        author-practitioner. Persian stucco was primarily made of gypsum, but it
        was made in small quantities and “rather stiff... It is then freely
        manipulated, being pressed and kneaded with the hands until the mass
        attains a certain plasticity... The ornamentation [is] finished by

    <h2 id="recipe-reconstruction">Recipe Reconstruction</h2>
    <p>This survey of stucco materials and techniques in premodern Europe
        reveals that there were numerous recipes for stucco in circulation, but
        the author-practitioner’s recipe appears unusual in one respect: its use
        of tragacanth gum. Moreover, it is the only recorded recipe I have
        located that employs flour as a primary ingredient without lime, chalk,
        or plaster—even though the author-practitioner corrects the entry by
        commenting in the margins that flour does not work well. Overall, this
        review of early modern stucco helps to illuminate several significant
        aspects of the material and its use. Stucco had been used for centuries
        before the author-practitioner’s time but experienced a resurgence in
        the mid-sixteenth century, when it became fashionable again, as
        evidenced by its use in the palaces of Hampton Court and Fontainebleau.
        Before and during the author-practitioner’s time, ingredients other than
        water and gypsum or lime were used—specifically, perishable ingredients,
        like flour and milk. This helps situate the author-practitioner’s
        initial inclusion of flour as a primary ingredient. In addition, it is
        possible that flour was included as an inexpensive ingredient, readier
        to hand than chalk or plaster.</p>
    <p>The last line on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/29r/f/29r/tl"><u>29r</u></a>
        is significant: “it is to make an ornament at little expense.” The
        majority of surviving historical recipes emphasize stucco’s use as a
        material for plastering walls or as a material which could be shaped by
        hand. The author-practitioner’s emphasis on molding stucco rather than
        shaping it indicates that he was working with pre-existing patterns
        rather than generating new designs.<a href="#fn46"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref46"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>46</sup></a> Moreover, his instruction that
        the mixture should be kneaded like bread implies that he was working
        with small quantities which could be manipulated by one person. Perhaps,
        then, the author-practitioner’s method was meant to be a comparatively
        inexpensive and fast method to create small amounts of stucco for
        molding, to be used decoratively.</p>
    <p>Reconstructions of the recipe on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/29r/f/29r/tl"><u>29r</u></a>
        help to shed light on the author-practitioner’s methods for creating
        stucco; indeed, the flour-based recipes produced inferior results.<a
           href="#fn47"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref47"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>47</sup></a> While there is a great
        difference in the longevity of stucco made from flour and from plaster
        of Paris, in both cases, the tragacanth gum made the mixture malleable
        and easily moldable. The wheat and rye flour stucco were not completely
        dry, even after a week, which contradicts the author-practitioner’s
        claim that the “stucco for molding” would be dry within one day.
        Moreover, in the process of drying, the wheat flour stucco cracked
        considerably (<i><u>Fig. 3</u></i>). The rye flour stucco fared slightly
        better (<i><u>Fig. 4</u></i>). Chalk produced a good impression, yet it
        began to show small cracks on the surface after a week of drying.
        Plaster of Paris stucco resulted in the smoothest and most durable
        finished product (<i><u>Fig. 5</u></i>). I used pre-prepared plaster of
        Paris which had a fine and even consistency, but it had not been slaked,
        and so it reacted quickly to the water in the tragacanth gum mixture and
        set rapidly. Nevertheless, it seems that the tragacanth gum helped the
        mixture stay malleable before and during the molding process. With this
        material, the author-practitioner tackled the issue of plasticity, which
        was addressed by others using different additives. Cennini’s recipe for
        <em>gesso grosso</em> makes plaster malleable through the use of glue,
        whereas the 1503 manuscript at St. Mark’s Basilica employs slaked lime
        which, when mixed vigorously, becomes somewhat unctuous, aiding the
        molding process. However, glue and tragacanth gum jelly are viscous
        without needing vigorous mixing, which possibly expedites the stucco
        making process and keeps the mixture plastic for longer. Further
        recreations of early modern recipes might help clarify the role or
        efficacy of glue compared to tragacanth gum when molding stucco, as well
        as the different properties of slaked versus un-slaked plaster of Paris.

                warns that wheat flour produces more brittle stucco. After
                nearly three weeks in the open air in the lab, the wheat-based
                stucco was very fragile and broke apart upon moving. The
                cracking around the edge of the flower likely resulted from of
                the stucco expanding, then contracting, a few days after being
                made. As none of the other stucco mixtures expanded and
                contracted, this process was possibly caused by an interaction
                between the wheat flour and tragacanth gum. The other
                wheat-stucco piece pictured (upper right) did not crack as

        is not the only entry in the manuscript about stucco, but it is the
        lengthiest (see Table 1 for all references to stucco). Other recipes
        give instructions for making, glueing, or molding stucco. On fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/12v/f/12v/tl"><u>12v</u></a>,
        the entry “Molding stucco promptly” describes how to make a mold out of
        pre-existing material, in this case a “relief medal;” a marginal note
        commenting on the advantages of using crushed and sieved brick over
        Armenian bole implies that the author-practitioner used this recipe. On
        fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/80r/f/80r/tl"><u>80r</u></a>,
        “Very hard white stucco” is a very short entry and consists solely of a
        list of four ingredients with no instructions. These ingredients,
        particularly the white wax, suggest that this recipe also produces a
        malleable stucco that can be used for molding and that will look white
        without needing paint.</p>
    <p>Fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/29r/f/29r/tl"><u>29r</u></a>
        offers the most extended discussion of stucco, containing the following
        lines: “One makes ceiling ornaments with it in Rome. One can make bed
        ornaments with it.” Whether the author-practitioner had visited Rome or
        learned about the stucco decorations there through other means, this
        line indicates the author-practitioner’s familiarity with uses of stucco
        outside of Toulouse. Moreover, the author-practitioner notes the use of
        stucco for ornamenting beds. This is one of several instances in which
        the author-practitioner mentions bed ornamentation, suggesting that he
        was particularly interested in domestic decoration (Table 2). Notably,
        Plat also mentioned stucco as a material for bed and furniture
        decorations, and domestic ornaments were perhaps more common in early
        modern Europe than is recognized today. Comparatively few examples of
        such works survive, perhaps owing to their daily use, which may have
        left them more vulnerable to damage, or perhaps because they were
        considered less valuable and thus less important to preserve.</p>
    <p>The author-practitioner wrote that “this stucco with the tragacanth gum
        has the quality that, yielding when it is not yet dry, it can be
        accommodated on either round or flat things, as you like.” There is no
        indication as to what the author-practitioner meant by “round or flat
        things”—a “flat thing” could easily be a wall, or table, or bed post. A
        round thing could be a vaulted ceiling, a curved bed post, or the
        underside of an archway. In any case, the author-practitioner made clear
        that this stucco is versatile and that ornaments made with it can be
        applied to almost any surface. If indeed the stucco described on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/29r/f/29r/tl"><u>29r</u></a>
        was inexpensive, it could have been used to replace more expensive
        ornamentation, such as stone sculpture or wood carving, or any sort of
        “counterfeit,” to use Plat’s term. It may be that the
        author-practitioner had experience in creating ephemeral art, copies, or
        decorations which were intended for a specific and short-term purpose
        and not intended to last long.</p>
    <p>After the stucco ornaments have been molded, the author-practitioner
        instructs: “Next, you will apply them with strong glue or paste glue, as
        you like, and you will be able to paint and decorate them with gold
        &amp; all colors.” During the first round of experimentation, it was
        unclear whether the author-practitioner meant that the glue could be
        used for sticking the stucco on a surface or if he meant that it should
        be used to coat the stucco before applying colors or gilding. We had
        previously made stucco in the lab, so I experimented by painting on
        pieces which had been coated in rabbit skin glue and/or gesso, or left
        without a coating.<a href="#fn48"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref48"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>48</sup></a> During this first
        reconstruction, we created a paste glue that was rather viscous and
        lumpy, and we concluded that such a glue would not have been used to
        coat the stucco. Rabbit skin glue, on the other hand, is smooth and easy
        to apply, and seemed an ideal coating—and sealant—for stucco. Future
        reconstructions should try isinglass or fish glue, as per Plat, and
        observe any variations. Regarding the effects of painting the stucco,
        further investigation is required.<a href="#fn49"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref49"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>49</sup></a> Tentative experiments show that
        the rye flour stucco took paint well even without a coating, which
        implies that flour stucco could be useful on a limited budget or when
        time was lacking, despite the author-practitioner’s comments. Generally
        speaking, oil-based paint produced the richest hue, and the stucco
        coated in rabbit skin glue took the paint best and did not obscure
        details in the stucco (<i><u>Fig. 6</u></i>).</p>

                painted with linseed oil and verdigris. Green, round stucco (on

                skin glue uniformly made the painted stucco more shiny and the
                paint more uniform. The chalk stucco in the photo could have
                benefitted from rabbit skin glue coating, as the paint was lumpy
                in places. © Making and Knowing Project (<a

    <p>In Spring 2019, I continued my research on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/29r/f/29r/tl"><u>29r</u></a>
        to better understand whether priming stucco with glue before painting it
        made a difference in its appearance. The lab had finished recreating the
        author-practitioner’s recipe for a stucco powder made from plaster of
        Paris soaked for thirty days, so I was able to use it to make a
        previously untested type of stucco. When combined with tragacanth gum,
        the thirty-day recipe produced a uniquely stretchy and white stucco. In
        addition, I tested priming stucco with either paste glue or strong glue
        and found that the various glues made a difference in paint intensity
        and texture. For example, priming the stucco with fish glue (one
        potential interpretation of “strong glue”) resulted in brighter and more
        solid colors with no marks from the paintbrush. The disks primed with
        rabbit skin glue (a second tested proxy for “strong glue”) still had
        visible cracks and therefore the resulting product did not have a smooth
        surface texture. Regardless of whether they were primed or not, the
        painted rye flour stucco disks had bright colors and a smooth surface
        texture, even though the dark background of the rye flour made the color
        seem darker than when applied on the disks with a white base.<a

    <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The author-practitioner’s use of tragacanth gum appears to be unusual
        among stucco recipes, although its use seems to facilitate easy
        manipulation and thereby addresses a problem that other writers solved
        with different stucco additives such as glue or slaked lime. The
        author-practitioner’s original call for flour and subsequent correction
        raise questions still. Where or how did he obtain this recipe, and was
        the use of tragacanth gum his own idea? For what purpose did he intend
        his stucco—for temporary structures, wall and ceiling ornamentation, or
        furniture—and was it intended for indoor or outdoor use? Perhaps, like
        the Romans he mentions, the author-practitioner used his stucco to
        decorate ceilings and walls. We do know that he was interested in bed
        ornamentation as it is mentioned several times throughout the
        manuscript, whereas ceilings and walls are mentioned only on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/29r/f/29r/tl"><u>29r</u></a>.
    </p>
    <p>The author-practitioner’s multiple marginal notes on stucco recipes
        indicate that he was trying to make a durable, uniform, and white
        result. As he mentions using molds in various entries in the manuscript,
        it is clear that he was working from pre-existing models or patterns, or
        making molds from other objects, rather than sculpting new forms. The
        relative ease of the process implies that he might have been making
        ephemeral art: temporary, ornamental decorations which were not intended
        to be unique or long-lasting. Given the scarcity of extant examples and
        the limited scholarship on the materials and techniques for making
        ephemeral art, the author-practitioner’s interest in cheap yet durable
        ornamental stucco remind us of the significance of domestic and
        temporary decorative arts in the early modern period, and illustrate the
        importance of studying craft practices to widen our understanding of art
        making in the sixteenth century.</p>

                    <p>Take tragacanth gum and put it to soak until, having
                        drunk its water, it is swollen &amp; rendered like
                        jelly. Then grind it quite hard on marble &amp; next
                        take rye flour, which is better than wheat because it is
                        more humid and does not make the paste as brittle, and
                        sprinkle your tragacanth gum with it, &amp; continue to
                        grind and mix in thus, little by little, le et mesler
                        legi the very finely sieved flour. And knead it as if
                        you wanted to make bread, until you you perceive that it
                        has enough body &amp; is as firm as bread dough that one
                        is ready to put in the oven. This is recognized when it
                        can stretch enough without breaking. And if it was not
                        strong enough, it would not sti release well. Once the
                        paste is prepared, rub the hollow form au u with oil,
                        with a brush, in order that the oil penetrates
                        everywhere to make it release better, and press the
                        paste inside quite hard. And if it does not release
                        well, mix in more flour until it has enough body. With
                        this you will mold whatever work you like, masks or
                        garlands, which will be dry within one day. Next, you
                        will apply them with strong glue or paste glue, as you
                        like, and you will be able to paint and decorate them
                        with gold &amp; all colors. One makes ceiling ornaments
                        with it in Rome. One can make bed ornaments with it. If
                        you want that the work stays white, it is better to mold
                        with plaster instead of flour. It is true that it is
                        more brittle and firm as well, but one needs to prepare
                        it like this: temper it, when it is powdered strong, in
                        a good amount of water so that it is clear, &amp; grind
                        it several times a day for fifteen days. Then pour off
                        the water by tilting, and gather the plaster &amp; grind
                        it finely on marble, &amp; place it in some kind of
                        clean lead vessel, so that no dust &amp; dirt falls into
                        it, &amp; leave it in the open air &amp; in the serain
                        for fifteen days with its water, and it will become
                        matte, strong, white and light, very suitable for making
                        a seat for burnished gold. And this, in powder form, you
                        can mix, instead of flour, with tragacanth gum, and your
                        work will be very beautiful. Lacking plaster, you can
                        mix in well ground chalk or ceruse, &amp; try bole &amp;
                        similar things. This stucco with the tragacanth gum has
                        the quality that, yielding when it is not yet dry, it
                        can be accommodated on either round or flat things, as
                        you like. It is to make an ornament at little expense.

                <p>Lime is extracted from limestone and/or seashells through a
                    heating process. Slaking is the process of combining burnt
                    lime, also called quicklime, with water. This produces
                    slaked lime (calcium hydroxide) which is a fine powder and a
                    versatile building material when re-combined with water.<a

                    Savino, the Sculptor” which is described as “admirable
                    Stucco for making and modeling figures and for coloring and
                    resisting water. Take of finely powdered travertine 5 lb.,
                    and if you would have it fine and more delicate, take fine
                    marble instead of travertine, and 2 lb. of slaked lime, and
                    stir and beat them well together like a fine paste and
                    execute what work you will with it, either by forming it
                    with your hands, or in moulds, and dry it in the shade.” The
                    instructions go on to explain how this stucco can be made
                    waterproof and painted. This recipe is almost exactly the
