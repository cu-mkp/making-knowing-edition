        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <div>
            <p>BnF Ms. Fr. 640 features several recipes for making “sand” molds.
                They usually involve the combination of a dry element with a wet
                binding agent, often referred to as “<em>magistra</em>.” This
                essay examines the sand casting technique described on fol. <a
                   href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/84v/f/84v/tl"><u>84v</u></a>
                that involves the use of a mixture of calcined and pulverized ox
                foot bone with elm root boiled in wine. While ox foot bone is
                referenced in the manuscript as an ideal medium for sand
                casting, the particular properties of elm root boiled in wine as
                a binder are less clear. In our reconstruction of the recipe
                entitled “Sand,” we sought not only to shed light on the
                ingredients and procedures involved in the preparation of the
                elm root and wine binder but also to consider the nature and
                processes by which knowledge is produced in the Making and
                Knowing laboratory.</p>

    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>BnF Ms. Fr. 640 features various recipes
        for making “sand” molds, typically involving the combination of a dry
        element and a wet binding agent, the latter often referred to as a
        “<em>magistra</em>.” While nearly all sand molding recipes feature this
        basic combination, the substances that can fulfill the role of “dry” or
        “wet” elements are diverse. For instance, <em>magistra</em> can refer to
        anything from egg whites (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/69r/f/69r/tl"><u>69r</u></a>:
        “in big works [of sand casting] it is necessary to moisten the sands
        with <em>magistra</em> or glair of egg”) to saltwater (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/84v/f/84v/tl"><u>84v</u></a>:
        entry on “<em>Eau magistra</em>”), to wine—as is the case in an entry on
        fol. 84v, simply entitled “Sand,” which this essay treats. This account
        of the author-practitioner’s first hand experience involves two
        components, calcined and pulverized ox foot bone and wine boiled with
        elm root:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>I tried the bone of oxen <sup>feet</sup>, thoroughly burned &amp;
            pulverized &amp; ground on porphyry, until it is not felt between
            your fingers. It molds on its own very neatly. But because on its
            own it is very arid &amp; lean, it wants to be well moistened &amp;
            dampened with wine boiled with elm root.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Ox foot bone ash makes up the dry component of the sand in this recipe.
        This substance is referenced at various other points in the manuscript
        as an ideal medium for sand casting: for instance, on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/67v/f/67v/tl"><u>67v</u></a>,
        in a recipe entitled “Bones of the foot of oxen for sand” (“<em>Os de
            pied de beuf pour sable</em>”), the author-practitioner informs us
        that “once having been burned well twice &amp; pulverized, they mold
        very neatly in sand &amp; need not be reheated, but simply heated with
        the flame of straw.” Ox foot bones also feature in a recipe for sand on
        fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/89r/f/89r/tl"><u>89r</u></a>,
        which involves calcining and pulverizing them, combining them with rock
        salt, and leaving them to dampen “in the <em>serain</em> of the night or
        in the moisture of the cellar.”<a href="#fn1"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref1"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
    <p>The wet component of the recipe on fol. 84v is a “wine boiled with elm
        root.” Elm root is mentioned throughout the manuscript in connection
        with making a binder for sand molds; the only reference to elm roots
        that is not connected with this practice is on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/71r/f/71r/tl"><u>71r</u></a>,
        where the author-practitioner discusses colors of various woods for
        inlay work: “The elm, in its knotty root, has beautiful streaks
        diversified with grey and black, and the root of the maple, but one
        needs to choose well the grain of the wood.”</p>
    <p>The elm roots boiled in wine formed the puzzle for our reconstruction,
        for the author-practitioner seems to assume boiling elm roots in wine to
        be an unproblematic procedure, one that his readers would probably be
        familiar with. Other recipes in Ms. Fr. 640 containing elm roots help to
        clarify the procedure. On fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/69v/f/69v/tl"><u>69v</u></a>,
        the author-practitioner states that “lean” (<em>maigres</em>) sands can
        be moistened by the addition of “boiled wine with elm tree roots &amp;
        similar things” (more on the concept of “lean” and “fatty” sands below).
        Another recipe for “<em>Magistra</em>,” on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/87v/f/87v/tl"><u>87v</u></a>,
        states that “Founders take the roots of a young elm when it is in sap
        &amp; boil it in wine, or better yet vinegar, and keep it all year long
        in a barrel.” It thus seemed reasonable that the liquid to which the
        recipe on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/84v/f/84v/tl"><u>84v</u></a>
        refers would be produced by boiling elm roots in wine, but we were
        unsure what properties boiling elm roots in wine would create and why
        this would make a good binder. This was a question because other recipes
        in the manuscript call for wine alone (“good pure wine,” for example, on
        fol. 69v) as a binding agent. What qualities might the elm root impart
        to the wine? Given that the author-practitioner specifically mentions
        that founders boil elm roots in wine when the elm is “in sap,” what
        effect does this have? These are some of the questions we had when we
        began our reconstruction of the recipe. As we planned and carried out
        our experiments, we also came to realize that we were relying heavily
        upon a variety of sources for gaining experience and knowledge, and we
        found ourselves asking many questions about the nature of experiential
        knowledge and about the processes of knowledge production both in our
        own lab and in the early modern workshop.</p>
    <h2 id="elm-roots">Elm Roots</h2>
    <p>The first step in creating the elm root decoction was to source elm
        roots, which proved a particular challenge in our desire to replicate
        the recipes as authentically as possible. First, the harvesting of the
        elm roots for this recipe is seasonally contingent. The
        “<em>Magistra</em>” entry on fol. 87v mentions “roots of a young elm
        when it is in sap.” Sap flow occurs during spring, as a result of
        changes in root pressure stimulated by temperature variations. As we
        were conducting these experiments in April, it seemed we were perfectly
        timed to collect fresh elm roots to boil in wine.</p>
    <p>Initially, the elm we settled on for our recipe was <em>Ulmus
            americana</em>, which Pamela Smith located in the New York Botanical
        Garden and arranged to be harvested. However, as its name suggests, this
        species is native to Northeastern America, and therefore would not have
        been the type of elm to which the author-practitioner refers. However,
        Deanna F. Curtis, Curator of Woody Plants at the New York Botanical
        Garden, suggested via email that an elm hybrid cultivar known as
        “Pioneer” (binomial <em>Ulmus x hollandica</em>) might be more suitable
        for our purposes, as the Pioneer cultivar is formed by the crossing of
        two European species, <em>Ulmus glabra</em> (or Wych Elm) and <em>Ulmus
            minor</em> (the Smooth-leaved Elm), and thus more closely
        approximated the European elms from which the author-practitioner would
        have sourced his roots than did the <em>Ulmus americana.</em> We
        decided, therefore, that in the interests of authenticity, it would be
        better to use the Pioneer hybrid for our experiments.</p>
    <p>We also obtained a modern species of European elm roots from the
        horticultural gardens of Wave Hill. Visually, these roots contrasted
        greatly with those of the Pioneer elm: while the Wave Hill roots were
        thick and sturdy, almost resembling branches (<i><u>Fig. 1</u></i>), the
        roots of the Pioneer hybrid were very fine and delicate (<i><u>Fig. 2</u></i>).</p>

    <h2 id="boiling-elm-roots-in-wine">Boiling Elm Roots in Wine</h2>
    <p>We experimented first with boiling the Wave Hill roots, sourced by Wayne
        Morris, Assistant Director of Horticulture at Tree Man, a tree service
        company. Cutting them down into a suitable size was a rather
        intimidating process: the roots were much larger than we expected. Using
        a handsaw, we cut three of the root pieces into fairly large segments,
        each around 3–4 inches in length. In retrospect, we thought we might
        have achieved different results by cutting them into smaller pieces, in
        order to increase the surface area of the roots, thereby increasing the
        likelihood of sap being exposed to and interacting with the wine. We
        were initially skeptical about whether the tree was “in sap,” apparently
        the defining quality of the elm roots collected by founders, but when we
        began to handle them they felt fresh and bendable, and our fingers
        picked up a sticky residue from the cutting process.</p>
    <p>Once we felt that we had a sufficient quantity of cut-up roots, we
        measured out 500&nbsp;ml of our chosen wine (a cheap Cabernet
        Sauvignon—the manuscript, after all, says that vinegar is an even
        “better” medium than wine in which to boil the elm roots) into a metal
        pan, added 250&nbsp;g of elm roots, and placed the pan, uncovered, on a
        hotplate to boil. No quantities are noted in any of the recipes in which
        an elm root and wine decoction is mentioned, thus we extrapolated. We
        were especially interested to see what the consistency of the binder
        would be after boiling, as in Fall 2014, an experiment was done to
        produce the same binder but using slippery elm inner bark powder rather
        than fresh elm roots. The experimenters reported that boiling one cup of
        wine with two teaspoons of elm bark powder resulted in a very viscous
        liquid with a mucilaginous texture similar to that of albumen.<a
           href="#fn2"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref2"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> Our results were very different
        from the expectations that had been set by this 2014 trial. The wine in
        our experiment reduced to a fifth (around 100&nbsp;ml) in about 20–30
        minutes of boiling on the highest setting of the hot plate. Although the
        mixture certainly seemed more viscous, it was hard to tell if this was a
        quality imparted by the elm roots <em>per se</em>, or if this was simply
        the result of the wine’s reduction—and while the mixture could be
        described as viscous, it was certainly not of jelly or mucilaginous
        consistency. Nevertheless, we strained the elm root-wine liquid through
        a sieve into a jug, and then stored the mixture in a glass container in
        the lab refrigerator.</p>
    <p>Boiling the Pioneer elm roots was a less successful endeavor (at least as
        measured by our expectations that a viscous liquid was needed). After
        washing the roots thoroughly, we cut them into small pieces and placed
        them in a pan with the same amount of wine as used before
        (500&nbsp;ml)—and, again, the boiling process lasted for around 20–30
        minutes. However, the mixture that resulted from this experiment did not
        have even the viscosity of the first liquid. Perhaps this was due to the
        nature of these small, new elm roots: when handling them, we found them
        to be quite brittle and twig-like, and certainly not anywhere near as
        fresh and “sappy” as the Wave Hill roots. We considered that perhaps a
        longer boiling time was required to allow the heat to break down the elm
        roots, but boiling the Pioneer roots in two more trials, once for two
        hours and once for 6½ hours, seemed to produce no increased viscosity in
        the resultant liquid.<a href="#fn3"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref3"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
    <h2 id="taxonomies-and-material-properties">Taxonomies and Material
        Properties</h2>
    <p>Our lack of success with the Pioneer elm roots led us to consider a
        larger question about the difference in taxonomic ordering between the
        early modern period and the present day. Certain characteristics were
        selected for in the hybridization of the Pioneer elm, and our question
        was whether those were the same as the qualities valued by the
        author-practitioner. For the author-practitioner, the valuable
        properties or “virtues” of the elm seemed to center on the sappiness of
        the roots, whereas we suspected that the values selected for in
        modern-day hybridization would likely be morphological traits such as
        leaf size and shape. The Pioneer elm, then, as a hybrid of the European
        <em>Ulmus glabra</em> and <em>Ulmus minor</em>, might have been produced
        with the aim of recreating the appearance of a European elm rather than
        for the utilitarian properties prized by the author-practitioner. Pamela
        Smith contacted garden historian and Curator of the John Bartram Garden
        in Philadelphia, Joel T. Fry, with this question, to which he gave a
        particularly illuminating response: While sixteenth-century herbalists,
        artists, and craftspeople were interested in plants that “produced
        useful chemicals or compounds,” Fry stated, “modern, intentional
        hybridization of trees is mostly for some limited number of benefits.
        Something like dwarf size, a certain color, no fruit, no thorns, fast
        growth, or ease of propagation by cuttings. In the case of the ‘Pioneer’
        elm it looks like fast growth, and perhaps some resistance to Dutch elm
        disease were what they were looking for. Certainly, gooey sap from the
        roots would be one of the last things they were looking for.”<a
           href="#fn4"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref4"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> Given that tree hybridization now
        seeks to produce specimens that are fast-growing and profitable,
        according to Fry, it seems very likely that a property like root
        sappiness could have been lost in the process.</p>
    <h2 id="reconstructing-sand">Reconstructing Sand</h2>
    <p>We decided that, in order to create our sand, we would use the liquid
        produced from boiling the Wave Hill roots in our first experiment, and
        the liquid produced from the trial when the Pioneer hybrid was boiled
        for 20–30 minutes. As these two experiments had been conducted under
        identical conditions, using the same equipment and the same wine, we
        thought this would minimize the potential of additional confounding
        factors, while still allowing us to compare the “authentic” elm product
        with the “less authentic.”</p>
    <p>For the dry component of our sand, we had two options: a commercial bone
        ash and a non-commercial bone ash produced by calcining bovine foot
        bones in the lab kiln in Fall 2014. We decided that we would produce an
        “authentic” sand (made by combining the non-commercial bone ash with the
        Pioneer elm root liquid) and an “inauthentic” sand (a mixture of the
        commercial bone ash and the Wave Hill root decoction), so as to compare
        a sand that would be as close as possible to that used by the
        author-practitioner with a sand that made use of modern amenities and
        short-cuts (i.e., the commercial bone ash) and non-contemporary
        materials (the elm species that would not have been present in early
        modern Europe).</p>
    <p>The two experiments we performed—one which we perceived as faithful as
        possible to the materials with which our author-practitioner would have
        practiced his craft, and one which we saw as cleaving slightly less
        closely to historical context—can be situated in the distinction that
        Hasok Chang makes (developing on the work of Dietmar Höttecke) between
        “historical” replication of experiments, and “physical” replication.
        Historical replication, Chang explains, seeks to match as closely as
        possible the instruments and substances that would have been employed in
        past recipes. Physical replication, by contrast, uses “any convenient
        instruments and procedures that will help one create the phenomena of
        interest, and faithfulness to the details of the experiment is of
        secondary interest.”<a href="#fn5"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref5"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> The “philosophical challenge” of
        the latter, Chang asserts, is “not in the verification of the exactness
        of repetition, but in the characterization of the phenomena to be
        replicated.”<a href="#fn6"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref6"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> Chang’s division of
        experimentation of this sort into two distinct categories, neither of
        which is superior or inferior to the other, was useful, in that it
        helped us to look beyond a restrictive binary of “authentic” and
        “inauthentic” experimentation, and instead see both our experiments as
        seeking to replicate the activities of the author-practitioner in
        different, but equally valuable, ways.</p>
    <p>Although the process of making sand molds is detailed in various other
        recipes in the manuscript, the particular recipe for sand made from ox
        foot bone, elm root, and wine does not specify any particular method for
        combining the wet and dry elements, nor does it give any sense of the
        consistency that the sand should possess. We therefore relied on two
        sources in the mixing of our sand: texts, including not only Ms. Fr. 540
        but other contemporary works detailing artisanal practices; and our past
        experience in making sand molds. We had previously worked on making a

        the process of which was very similar to what we expected from this
        recipe. We therefore had a good sense of our procedure and a set of
        ingredient ratios on which we could base our new experiment.<a

    <p>Our first questions were: how wet should the sand be? What kind of
        texture and consistency should the sand possess? Contemporary technical
        literature assisted us in understanding the desired consistency of the
        sand. In the eighth book of Vannoccio Biringuccio’s metallurgical
        treatise <em>De la pirotechnia</em> (1540), in a chapter entitled
        “Various methods of Making Powders in Which to Cast Bronzes in the Small
        Art of Casting,” Biringuccio stipulates that sand for this type of
        casting should “stick together” if you squeeze it in the palm:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>A loam is made from these and mixed by beating with wool-cloth
            cuttings, spent washed ashes, and horse dung. This is made into
            cakes and dried. These are then put to bake in a furnace or in some
            other way and, in fact, one baked very well. Then it is pounded and
            sifted with a fine sieve, as it is ground in a potter’s color mill,
            or by hand on porphyry with water, to the fineness that the
            craftsman desires, or as fine as he can make it. When it has been
            ground, it is again drained free from water and dried out with fire.
            Then as much magistery of salt is taken as will moisten it. It is
            dried and pounded again and passed through a sieve. When it has been
            made as desired in this way it is moistened again before use with
            water, urine, or vinegar just enough so that it holds together when
            it is squeezed in the fist. Then, when it has been brought to this
            point, it is molded as you will hear.<a href="#fn8"

               id="fnref8"

    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>To determine the consistency of our bone
        ash without any added moisture, we tried squeezing it in our fists
        according to Biringuccio’s method. Although both types of bone ash
        actually did stick together a little (indeed, much more than we had
        expected), it was clear that neither would function as a sand without
        the addition of the binder.</p>
    <p>In our previous experiments with making sand molds with pine ash and
        wine, we found that very little wet binder was needed to moisten the dry
        part of the sand: in fact, we only used 20&nbsp;ml of wine to one cup of
        ash. Since the recipe for the sand made from bone ash, elm root, and
        wine was so similar to the one we had made earlier in the semester, we
        decided to begin this experiment using the same ratio of ingredients. We
        decided to make up the “inauthentic” sand first, composed of the
        commercial bone ash and the elm root and wine liquid derived from the
        Wave Hill roots. As there was only half a cup of commercial bone ash
        available to us, we measured out 10&nbsp;ml of the elm root and wine
        liquid, which we mixed little by little into the bone ash.</p>
    <p>We began mixing the two ingredients by hand in a plastic mixing bowl,
        adding the liquid periodically in very tiny volumes (a few milliliters
        per addition) and working it into the bone ash as if we were kneading a
        very dry dough. Very quickly it became apparent that the mixture was
        coming together; however, we decided that after adding the 10&nbsp;ml of
        liquid we had measured out, even more was needed to fully bind the sand.
        We therefore portioned out another 10&nbsp;ml of the liquid, and after
        working this into the bone ash, we felt that we had a sand with a good
        enough texture in which to mold—the sand was moist enough to stick
        together when squeezed in the fist, but it did not feel wet in any way (<i><u>Fig. 3</u></i>). The addition of the red elm root liquid to the
        white commercial bone ash produced sand of a beautiful to shell-pink
        color, as Fig. 3 shows. This figure also illustrates how the mixture
        clumped to our satisfaction according to the Making and Knowing lab’s
        “squeeze test,” which we were taught to use with all types of sand
        molding.<a href="#fn9"

    <p>Our more authentic ingredients, however, did not combine in the same way.
        One cup of non-commercial bone ash required the addition of 70&nbsp;ml
        of liquid in order to produce a suitable sand for casting, nearly twice
        the amount of liquid binder required for the commercial bone ash (and
        over three times as much as required for the pine ash in our previous
        sand casting work). As we were working the sand, we found that it felt
        much coarser than the commercial bone ash; in fact, it felt similar to
        beach sand. This was presumably because the calcination process had not
        been fully completed, and some impurities remained in the bone ash. But
        why would we need to add so much more liquid than our previous sand had
        required?</p>
    <p>The answer to this may lie in the distinction between “lean” and “fatty”
        sands that the manuscript articulates. In this material imaginary,
        “lean” typically refers to sands that are dry and crumbly, while “fatty”
        designates sands that clump together easily (for example, on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/84v/f/84v/tl"><u>84v</u></a>,
        the same page on which the recipe for sand from ox foot, elm root, and
        wine appears, the author claims that “a fatty sand which is rendered
        very smooth, makes it [the cast] porous”). Most relevant, though, is the
        passage on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/69v/f/69v/tl"><u>69v</u></a>,
        which states that</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>It is necessary that lean sands be more moistened than others, namely
            with magistra or good pure wine or boiled wine with elm tree roots
            &amp; similar things. But very fine sands, like burned linen, which
            is fatty &amp; soft on its own, want to be applied dry.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>Adopting the author-practitioner’s
        terminology, we can characterize the very fine commercial bone ash as
        “fatty &amp; soft” and the non-commercial bone ash as “lean” and
        therefore in need of more moistening than a “fatty” sand.<a href="#fn10"

    <p>Once our sands were clumping properly, we set about the process of
        molding. We used small mason jar lids as our frame molds, since we had
        so little of each type of bone ash. Our first attempt was to mold a
        simple shape (a key) in the commercial bone ash. Although it imprinted
        well, it was very difficult to get the key back out of the mold without
        completely disturbing the impression. We therefore switched to two
        different objects which were rounded and much deeper than the key: a
        round, knobbled earring, and a medallion with the raised impression of a
        bird. The bird was pressed into the sand made from commercial bone ash
        and the earring into the sand made from the lab-produced bone ash. The
        models were easy to remove from their respective molds (<i><u>Fig. 4</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 5</u></i>).</p>

    <p>We were frankly astonished by the clarity of both casts when we broke
        them out of the molds (very easily—clearly no release agent required).
        Both had picked up a large amount of detail, and the sand made from
        commercial bone ash in particular had produced an exceptionally smooth
        surface on our cast bird medallion. The cast of the earring had
        noticeable stippling on its surface, which we assumed resulted from the
        relative coarseness of the sand made from lab-made bone ash. That said,
        even the detail of that coarseness was fine and rendered in tiny,
        perfect detail (<i><u>Fig. 6</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 7</u></i>). Both types
        of bone ash seemed to produce a finer cast than the calcined alabaster
        experiments going on in the lab at the same time, which had also
        produced a cast of the bird medallion.<a href="#fn14"

                    us, made possible our questions about taxonomic
                    classification and valuable material properties. Such
                    connections helped us to determine the type of modern elm to
                    substitute for an elm that would have been used in
                    sixteenth-century France, and thus provided us with the
                    “correct” roots to use.<a href="#fn20"

    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>The point we want to make with the list
        above is that the activities of a busy workshop, while relying in part
        upon the authority of outside experts—the New York Botanical Garden, the
        Curator of the John Bartram Garden, and expert makers—take place in a
        space where knowledge is not just handed down from above or obtained
        from outside experts, but where techniques and knowledge <em>emerge</em>
        through the collective work of the community that is active in that
        space. Production of knowledge in this setting is thus distributed,
        collective, and emergent. In many respects, then, our reconstruction
        could be considered largely the work of others, a view in sharp contrast
        to the conception of individual creativity and originality that
        structures so much of the rhetoric about the production of knowledge in
        our own day.</p>

                <p>The recipe for tree ash as a medium for sand molds is as
                    follows: “The white ash of all woods, which still sticks to
                    the wood that burns, and which has not fallen into the
                    hearth, molds very neatly.” We used ash from pine wood burnt
                    in a cast iron wood stove, and the ash was collected from
                    the bottom of the stove after having fallen from the wood.
                    The sand in various mold making recipes in Ms. Fr. 640 is
                    described as fine and pulverized. On fol. 93r, yet another
                    recipe labelled “Sand” calls for soot, suggesting that the
                    tree ash needs to be of a very fine, talcum-powder or
                    soot-like texture. We found that the ash required very
                    little liquid binder to render it suitable to mold an object
                    (only 20 ml of wine), but the cast object did not exhibit a
                    particularly high level of detail. See our field notes on

                <p>A lively discussion took place in 2015 among scholars of the
                    Making and Knowing Project and botanical experts as to the
                    difference between sixteenth-century and modern
                    understandings of taxonomic organization with regard to the
                    properties of the plant materials which are used as
                    ingredients in Ms. Fr. 640. A major question became the
                    exact nature of the divide between modern practices of
                    determining a plant’s taxonomy by its <em>genetic</em>
                    features versus the categorization of visible or
                    “transformational” properties determined by scientists and
                    artisans before the advent of theories of genetic
                    transmission of characteristics. We thank Prof. Smith and
                    Joel T. Fry, Curator of the John Bartram Garden in
                    Philadelphia, for starting this discussion.<a
