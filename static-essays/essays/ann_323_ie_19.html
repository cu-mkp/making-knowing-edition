        <div>
            <p>Recipe collections are the major literary genre for the
                transmission of technical knowledge from Antiquity through the
                early modern period. Their flexibility allowed for the
                adaptation to a number of different uses in various contexts,
                from specialized workshop notebooks to encyclopedic compendia.
                This essay compares the author-practitioner of BnF Ms. Fr. 640
                with a slightly older South German counterpart, Wolfgang
                Sedelius (1491/92–1562). As a monk and court preacher, Sedelius
                comes from a different social and intellectual milieu than the
                anonymous French author-practitioner. Although first and
                foremost a theologian, he was also broadly interested in
                mathematics, mechanics, artisanal techniques, chemistry, and
                medicine. His three surviving recipe collections, compiled over
                a period of about thirty years, document the personal approach
                of a scholar interested in a variety of technical and scientific
                fields. In his later manuscripts Sedelius interviewed and
                observed expert practitioners and personally experimented
                himself—approaches similar to that of the author-practitioner of
                Ms. Fr. 640, although their individual interests and expertises
                differ.</p>

    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
    <p>Recipe collections are the major literary genre for the transmission of
        technical knowledge from Antiquity up to the early modern period. Their
        openness and flexibility allowed for the adaptation to a number of
        different purposes, from specialized workshop notebooks to more
        comprehensive compendia of knowledge addressed to and used by diverse
        communities. Thus, the purpose and audience of each recipe collection
        needs to be determined individually.</p>
    <p>The Making and Knowing Project has linked the author-practitioner of BnF
        Ms. Fr. 640 with the Royal Arsenal and with artisans and merchants
        working in late sixteenth-century Toulouse.<a href="#fn1"

           role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> It is possible that he intended
        his manuscript to be published, however, the role of practical
        experience and reflection in it differs significantly from printed books
        of secrets and household books which aimed to comply with the interests
        of a broader audience on a growing market for all kinds of practical
        literature.<a href="#fn2"

        tradition of compiling technical recipes had not yet disappeared in the
        early modern period.</p>
    <p>A comparison of the author-practitioner with a slightly older German
        counterpart coming from this monastic background gives insights into
        distinct ways of individual appropriation and use of technical knowledge
        and the role of recipe manuscripts as epistemic tools in different
        cultural, intellectual, and social contexts of the sixteenth century.

    <h2 id="wolfgang-sedelius-life-and-work">Wolfgang Sedelius: Life and work
    </h2>
    <p>Wolfgang Sedelius (Seidel), born in 1491/2 in Mauerkirchen (Upper
        Austria) attended the Latin school in Landshut and the University of
        Ingolstadt for one term.<a href="#fn4"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref4"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> In 1517 he took vows in the
        Benedictine abbey of Tegernsee. After a short stay in the sister abbey
        Andechs, he officiated as ducal preacher in Munich from 1532 through
        1560. Retired to Tegernsee, he died on June 11, 1562.</p>
    <p>In the fifteenth century, Tegernsee had become one of the promoters of
        the Benedictine reform of Melk which not only aimed at a renewal of
        monastic life but also of learning.<a href="#fn5"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref5"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> Monks studied at the universities
        of Vienna or Ingolstadt, both renowned in the field of astronomy and
        mathematics.<a href="#fn6"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref6"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> But the study of mathematics,
        astronomy and other <em>artes</em> played an important role also in
        Tegernsee itself.<a href="#fn7"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref7"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> At least six surviving fifteenth-
        and early sixteenth-century manuscripts document the interest of
        Tegernsee monks in technical recipes. The most comprehensive of these
        recipe collections, the <em>Liber illuministarum</em>, was compiled
        between ca. 1500 and 1512 by the scribe, illuminator, and librarian
        Konrad Sartori (c. 1480–1531).<a href="#fn8"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref8"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> It includes information on
        pigments, illumination and painting, dyeing, metal work, and medicine.
        Tegernsee thus offered Sedelius a stimulating environment as well as a
        rich library to pursue his personal interests in technical knowledge and
        mathematics. Sedelius exchanged information by letter with other
        humanist monks, Nikolaus Ellenbog in the monastery of Ottobeuren and
        Vitus Bild in St. Ulrich and Afra in Augsburg.<a href="#fn9"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref9"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> In his time as ducal preacher,
        his personal network expanded beyond the monastic sphere and he was in
        contact with intellectuals and artisans at the court and in the cities
        of Munich and Augsburg.</p>
    <p>The large literary legacy of Sedelius consists—not surprising for a
        preacher and counter-reformer—mainly of sermons and theological
        literature.<a href="#fn10"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref10"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> His remaining works document
        clearly his personal interest in technical and scientific questions,
        with no less than seven of thirty-seven preserved manuscripts devoted
        completely or in part to mathematical, astronomical, technical, or
        medical topics. Art technological recipes are found in three of them:
        St. Gall, Kantonsbibliothek, Hs. VadSlg. 404; Munich, Bayerische
        Staatsbibliothek, Cgm 4117, and Cgm 4118.<a href="#fn11"

        of sundials; and with medicine, chemistry, and metallurgy.<a

        well-established methods of appropriation and transmission of knowledge:
        the medieval tradition of florilegia as reference books for preachers<a

           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref14"

           id="fnref15"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> Consequently, the title
        <em>collectaneum</em> was used by Sedelius for different collections of

           id="fnref19"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a> In some cases the
        <em>collectanea</em> also included works by Sedelius himself, such as

    <p>In contrast, he classified his manuscript Munich, Bayerische
        Staatsbibliothek, cgm 4117 as a <em>buech</em> (“book”).<a href="#fn21"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref21"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a> The content of this
        <em>buech</em> is very similar to that of the <em>collectaneum</em> Vad.
        404; the difference in genre consists in the approach to collecting and
        systematizing knowledge. Cgm 4117, written about 1540, is also the sole
        survivor of a larger project. It is the “second book on various
        artisanal arts” (<em>Von manigerlai hanndwerchskunsten das Ander
            Buech</em>, fol. 1r), which was to be followed by another book on
        the “alchemical artisanal arts” (fol. 308r).<a href="#fn22"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref22"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a> In contrast to the
        <em>collectanea</em>, which reflect personal stages of knowledge
        acquisition and intellectual preoccupations, Sedelius conceived this
        “book” on craftsmanship as a systematic compendium clearly arranged
        according to techniques such as “painting and dyeing,” and subdivided
        into thematically coherent chapters. Alongside the well-known topics of
        color production, illumination, dyeing, and etching, the portion of
        chemical recipes was large, and casting techniques are introduced as a
        new important subject. This well-organized handbook on technical
        knowledge was, however, not self-contained but a working tool which
        Sedelius used, corrected, and amended over the years.</p>
    <p>Munich, Bayerische Staatsbibliothek, cgm 4118, written between ca. 1550
        and 1558, partly by the scribe Balthasar Gech, partly by Sedelius
        himself, seems to be an extension of cgm 4117 to include new knowledge
        for which space was lacking in the older book. Concerning working
        process and concept, it is a hybrid between a “book” and a
        <em>collectaneum</em>; starting as a thematically coherent “rhapsody of
        the art of casting” (fol. 1r), but expanding in the course of time to
        glass technology and medicine, topics which were only roughly ordered.
    </p>
    <p>Sedelius’ technical writings stand at a turning point between medieval
        monastic concepts of knowledge and early modern approaches. The
        <em>artes</em> system is the underlying principle of the
        <em>collectanea</em>, and in part still of the “Book on various
        artisanal arts.” The theological conviction that God obliged humans to
        live by the “labor of the hands”<a href="#fn23"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref23"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a> justifies the preacher’s
        estimation of craftsmanship, an estimation which is also rooted in the
        “Ora et labora” of the rule of St Benedict. However, while he published
        a number of his sermons and devotional texts in print, Sedelius
        explicitly excluded this “vulgarization” for his “<em>collectanea</em>
        on diverse arts” and reserved their use to his friends.<a href="#fn24"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref24"

        and oral information, its critical evaluation and sometimes even
        practical experimentation. This links him to the author-practitioner of
        Ms. Fr. 640. Some comparisons of thematic overlaps between the two may
        further highlight similarities and differences in their approaches to
        understanding, reflecting upon, and practicing technical knowledge.</p>

    <h3 id="music-automata">Music Automata</h3>
    <p>Both authors were interested in musical automata: a “spinet playing by
        itself” is described in Ms. Fr. 640 (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/104v/f/104v/tl"><u>104v</u></a>),<a

        137v–144v). The difference is significant: spinets were profane
        instruments, organs were used during holy office.<a href="#fn28"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref28"

    <p>Although much more comprehensive than the description of the spinet in
        Ms. Fr. 640, Sedelius’ small treatise on the automatic organ is no
        systematic instruction on how to build the instrument. Instead, he
        starts with an explanation of the principles of the mobile wheel and the
        distribution and size of the keys which will play an organ with four
        pipes (ut, re, mi, fa). Then he discusses the mathematical principles of
        how to calculate the size and distribution of the keys in relationship
        to the tone pitch. Several explanatory drawings accompany the text:
        geometrical sketches to demonstrate the relationship between size of
        keys and tone pitch, a table of tone pitches and cursory drawings of the
        mobile wheel and the organ (<i><u>Fig. 1</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 2</u></i>).

    <p>But there are only two isolated pieces of technical information
        concerning the construction itself: a drawing shows the form of the keys
        (fol. 144), and Sedelius writes that the keys and mobile wheel should be
        connected with iron wires (fol. 141). Different from the
        author-practitioner’s observations on the spinet automaton, Sedelius’
        focus was not on the mechanical construction but on the proper
        calculation of the sizes and distances of the keys on the mobile wheel
        related to tone pitch and musical harmony. He was particularly
        interested in mathematics, an interest that was probably stimulated
        during his study in Ingolstadt, a center of mathematics at the time—in
        fact, he exchanged books and recipes with the Ingolstadt mathematician
        Peter Apian, who is mentioned in the list of authors and books on Ms.
        Fr. 640, fol. <a

    <p>The author-practitioner was less interested in mathematics; instead,
        slightly more than a third of the entries in his manuscript are devoted
        to casting techniques. Sedelius, too, collected more than two hundred
        recipes covering this thematic field in cgm 4117 and cgm 4118. The
        topics are also similar: the production of sands for the sand-casting
        process, the wax casting process, molding with loam, wax, sulfur, or
        paper, different materials to be cast or stamped in molds including

    <p>Augsburg is also mentioned in Ms. Fr. 640; it is described as one of the
        places in Germany where an excellent <em>spat</em> for making a casting
        sand is found (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/108r/f/108r/tl"><u>108r</u></a>).
        <em>Spat</em> is an ambiguous term which could stand for different
        minerals, including mica (a variety of gypsum), fluorite, barite, or
        feldspar.<a href="#fn43"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref43"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>43</sup></a> The search for appropriate
        casting sands for various purposes was a major concern of both the
        author-practitioner and Sedelius. Interestingly, the Augsburg recipes
        copied by Sedelius’ scribe do not mention the use of <em>spat</em> in
        casting sand. The material is, however, used in some of Bishop Philipp’s
        prescriptions (cgm 4117, fols. 37v–39r). The process is very similar to
        that described in Ms. Fr. 640 (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/119v/f/119v/tl"><u>119v</u></a>).
        Sedelius or Philipp do not provide information on provenance or quality
        of the material—perhaps it was too familiar to them. There are other
        sand and mold materials where Sedelius thought it necessary to
        distinguish between different properties according to the deposits,
        e.g., gypsum or clay. The preparation and use of several loams and clays
        for molds which were dug from the surroundings of Augsburg are
        extensively discussed in cgm 4118. This interest in the knowledge of
        local professionals and the exploitation of local sources is comparable
        to Ms. Fr. 640. But since <em>spat</em> is not mentioned as one of these
        locally available materials in cgm 4118, we may conclude that it was
        perhaps not the actual provenance of <em>aspalt</em> from Augsburg to
        which the author-practitioner referred, but, instead, to the expertise
        of Augsburg casters.</p>
    <p>The author-practitioner knew and esteemed the practice of German
        casters.<a href="#fn44"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref44"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>44</sup></a> A sophisticated technique which
        he observed from German goldsmiths was the surface treatment of objects
        cast in silver (fol. <a

           role="doc-noteref"><sup>45</sup></a> Sedelius does not provide a
        relevant recipe; perhaps the technique was more recent, or he had no
        information on it. Some of his recipes, however, deal with a recent
        technology for the treatment of gold surfaces (cgm 4117, fols. 68v–69r).
        The so-called <em>glüh wachs</em> (“glowing wax”), a mixture of wax with
        copper and iron compounds, was smeared onto the golden object and melted
        to produce a more reddish golden hue. Recipes for this technique were in
        circulation in Germany from about 1520,<a href="#fn46"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref46"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>46</sup></a> and it is likely that the
        technology was invented by German goldsmiths.</p>
    <p>International knowledge transfer also played a role in sixteenth-century
        southern Germany. In this area, artisans, artists, intellectuals, and
        collectors were especially interested in contemporary Italian art and
        technology. There were close trade connections between south German
        centers like Augsburg or Nuremberg and northern Italy; artists and
        craftsmen crossed borders to work for princes and citizens.<a
           href="#fn47"

           id="fnref47"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>47</sup></a> When Sedelius refers to
        knowledge transfer and regional peculiarities he contrasts Italian
        (<em>welsch</em>) with (southern) German (<em>teutsch</em>) techniques.
        Thus, he discusses diverse techniques of plaster casting (cgm 4117, fol.
        45r–v), depending on the different properties of the local raw
        materials.</p>
    <h3 id="lifecasting">Lifecasting </h3>
    <p>In comparing different techniques of plaster casting, Sedelius made
        straightforward comparisons, but in the case of lifecasting, Sedelius
        becomes almost enthusiastic about the superior quality of the “Italian
        manner” (cgm 4118, fols. 99v–101v). The rubric, presumably copied from
        the Augsburg manuscript, warns about making this “very ingenious”
        (<em>faßt kunstreich</em>) knowledge available to everybody, and
        Sedelius noted in the margin that this recipe is “exceedingly excellent
        and cannot easily be compared to anything else.” He does not express a
        similar enthusiasm in the margins of the lifecasting recipes for leaves
        some pages before (cgm 4118, fols. 81v–82v) or for animals in his
        earlier “Book on various artisanal arts” (cgm 4117, fol. 140r–v). The
        recipe for casting birds, frogs, and lizards in cgm 4117 enumerates only
        cursorily the steps of making the form and burning the animal. The
        description of the “Italian manner” is much more detailed and includes
        different methods to kill frogs and worms, as well as information on
        their artificial arrangement before they are carefully encased with loam
        and burnt to ash. He also gives information on technical details like
        pouring gates, sprues, and the final silver cast.</p>
    <p>Sedelius certainly had seen lifecast animals or plants in the collections
        of the Bavarian dukes or in the workshops of casters working in Augsburg
        and Munich. But there is no indication that he experimented with casting
        himself. It was probably more the philosophical implications of
        recreated nature that fascinated Sedelius than the experience with the
        recipe’s practicability.<a href="#fn48"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref48"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>48</sup></a> The preoccupation of the
        author-practitioner with lifecasting goes even farther, in his attempts
        to imitate natural objects as closely as possible. The
        author-practitioner certainly aimed to gain more expertise in recreating
        nature, but he, too, was not just driven by the search for virtuosity
        but also by a broader concept of nature and regeneration.<a href="#fn49"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref49"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>49</sup></a></p>
    <h3 id="expert-knowledge-and-experiments">Expert knowledge and experiments
    </h3>
    <p>Whereas the author-practitioner seems to have practiced casting and other
        techniques himself, there are only few indications that Sedelius tried
        recipes personally. Words like “<em>probirt</em>” or “<em>probatum</em>”
        (“proven”), which are occasionally mentioned in Sedelius’ recipes were
        also used as topoi in contemporary manuscripts, and they may already
        have been present in the texts copied by Sedelius or his scribes.</p>
    <p>The case of glass technology is different. Sedelius was fascinated by the
        idea that crystal or glass could be softened, melted, or cast, and he
        tried to understand these processes through conversations with expert
        practitioners as well as through his own experiments. A striking example
        is a series of recipes for melting glass in cgm 4118 (fols. 132r–133r).
        Sedelius first reports a recipe which he received as personal
        communication from a potter. Below this entry, he adds a correction
        based on the information of another potter “who is also an artist,” and
        he notes at the margin of the first recipe that “it is not true” (fol.
        132v). He continues that he had tried the method of the “artist” with
        success, although he was only able to melt and not to cast the glass. He
        was able to observe this more sophisticated technique, however, in the
        workshop of two “artists” (<em>kunstler</em>).</p>
    <p>The author-practitioner of Ms. Fr. 640 likewise seems to have gained his
        information on glass making from discussions with and observation of
        professionals.<a href="#fn50"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref50"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>50</sup></a> His recipes describe the making
        of glass canes for beads and lampworking. By contrast, Sedelius’
        experiments with glass do not aim to produce objects. He is more
        interested in the process itself and in understanding the properties of
        glass; as a result he notes that it is “not the same thing to soften
        glass so that it can be printed like wax and to melt glass so that it
        can be cast” (fol. 133r). For Sedelius, compiling written information on
        techniques, seeking expert knowledge from practitioners, judging the
        expertise of simple artisans and more expert “artists,” and his own
        experiments are steps in an epistemic process to understand not only
        artisanal techniques but also the nature of materials.</p>
    <h2 id="conclusion-recipes-as-epistemic-tools">Conclusion: Recipes as
        Epistemic Tools</h2>
    <p>Sedelius had some expertise in clockwork making. He illustrated his books
        with colored drawings (<i><u>Fig. 3</u></i>), but he was not working as
        a caster or goldsmith. However, he was interested in recent and approved
        technologies. He copied and had scribes copy selected manuscript
        sources, and additionally he interviewed and observed artisans as
        authorities on technical knowledge. The recipes given to him by Count
        Palatine Philipp, too, came most probably from the workshop of the
        bishop’s casters. Sedelius studied them carefully for correctness and
        asked the caster Thomas to add missing information (cgm 4117, fol. 1v).
        Collecting, reviewing, testing, developing, and transforming technical
        prescriptions was part of an epistemic process for Sedelius. Where
        personal practical experience was missing, he relied on observation of
        and information from practitioners. He discussed recipes with them and
        learned about mistakes and new developments. In a few cases he even
        tried recipes himself. His interest in the verification of recipes by
        observation or practical experiments links him to the
        author-practitioner, although he does not go as far as the latter as a
        practitioner.</p>

    <p>His three surviving recipe collections, compiled over a period of about
        thirty years, document the personal approach of a scholar interested in
        a variety of technical and scientific fields. His earlier
        <em>collectanea</em> are still influenced by the medieval concept of the
        <em>artes mechanicae</em> and the monastic tradition of encyclopedic
        accumulation and transmission of knowledge. In the courtly and urban
        milieu of Munich and Augsburg, he became interested in new sophisticated
        techniques and materials, like casting, or recent glass technology. And
        he clearly also took part in the contemporary discourse on the
        properties of natural materials. This discourse was independent from the
        confessional disputes of the time. Intellectual networks in
        mid-sixteenth-century Germany transcended confessional boundaries, and
        the counter-reformer Sedelius could exchange technical and scientific
        expertise with the fervent protestant Bartholomäus Schobinger without
        even touching upon religious questions.<a href="#fn51"

    <p>Although he shared fields of interest with the author-practitioner of Ms.
        Fr. 640, Sedelius belonged to a different community of intellectuals
        connected by their interest in human abilities and skills. His “pursuit
        of secular science” and knowledge of the world remained enclosed by the
        Divine order.</p>
