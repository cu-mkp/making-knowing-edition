        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <div>
            <p>Artist Michael Price has dedicated his career to understanding
                the materials and techniques of early modern painters through
                historical painting recipes, technical analysis and conservation
                literature, and experiments using natural pigments and
                traditionally prepared binding mediums. His experience
                publishing his research findings and making processes position
                him as an ideal interlocutor for the author-practitioner of Ms.
                Fr. 640. In this essay, Price surveys the manuscript’s entries
                on the topics of painting and varnish, offering insights from
                his own practice and arguing that the author-practitioner’s
                knowledge of the painter’s craft is largely second hand.</p>

    <h2 id="michael-price">Michael Price</h2>
    <p>I have always been drawn to the works of the great masters from the
        Renaissance through to the seventeenth century. After graduation from
        the Central School of Art in London back in 1974, my first desire was to
        make drawings from the Poussin paintings in a variety of Museum
        collections. As my career as a professional artist started to take
        shape, I began to realize that I needed to understand much more about
        these works of art. By 1976, I was living in Holland and making notes
        from works by Vermeer and Rembrandt. In 1977, Munich became my home for
        the next twenty-two years. Little by little, I visited many museum
        collections from Paris and Vienna to Florence and Rome. During these
        years, the composition and subject matter was my main concern with
        regards to my own painting. However, there was one nagging question—why
        could I not get the same depth and subtly of color with my modern tubes
        of “industrialized” oil paint compared to the Flemish masters? Through a
        meaningful coincidence, I became acquainted with the head conservation
        scientist and later director of the Doerner Institute who introduced me
        to the paint layer analysis of a restored Tintoretto painting. This
        encounter changed my life! At first, I bought a few natural pigments
        from the shop opposite the museum, Kremer Pigmente, including azurite,
        ultramarine ash, and cinnabar. I mixed the blues with walnut oil and the
        cinnabar with linseed oil. Everything looked promising. Then within a
        month, the azurite and ultramarine ash were changing color. After one
        year there was an ugly discoloration. No one had any answers. I began to
        scour medieval manuscripts as well as museum conservation reports on
        binding medium analysis. This textual research proved frustrating. Not
        only were there inconsistencies in the way terms for materials were used
        from one recipe to another, but it was difficult to know with any
        certainty what those materials consisted of, especially binding mediums.
        At some point, I decided to approach the problem from the opposite
        direction—that is, by experimenting with mineral and organic pigments in
        my studio. Over time, my techniques evolved through an informed trial
        and error, my knowledge grew, and I came to understand a great deal
        about the preparation and properties of natural pigments. My results
        proved to be interesting enough that I was able to get seven-year ageing
        tests carried out on my paint samples by the Technische Universität in
        Vienna as well as binding medium tests by the Doerner Institute. Later,
        after my move to New York, I was able to do tests on lake pigments with
        the MoMA conservation department.<a href="#fn1"

    <p>As an artist and author who has spent my career interpreting historical
        craft recipes, experimenting in the studio with natural materials, and
        struggling to set down my own processes in words, I feel a particular
        affinity for the author-practitioner of Ms. Fr. 640. His compilation of
        recipes and observations—particularly his entries on the topics of
        painting and varnish—has proven far more interesting than I had
        expected. Some entries demonstrate a detailed practical knowledge, while
        others share surprisingly superficial or basic observations. Other
        entries still are obscure, provocative, or outright wrong. In the
        paragraphs to follow, I offer my response to select entries, from my
        perspective as a modern artist and researcher. My careful consideration
        of the entries on painting and varnish leave me with the impression that
        the author-practitioner had limited if any training as a professional
        painter. Nevertheless, there are great insights in the second-hand
        knowledge that he did collect, and his entries suggest fruitful
        directions for future research (<i><u>Fig. 1</u></i>).</p>

        Entries in Ms. Fr. 640</h2>
    <p>The Making and Knowing Project has assigned categories to each of the
        entries in the manuscript. Collectively, these two categories, painting
        and varnish, account for nearly twenty percent of the entries in Ms. Fr.
        640.<a href="#fn3"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref3"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> Thus, the art of the painter was
        of considerable interest to the author-practitioner. The table in
        appendix gives an overview of the entries on the topics of painting and
        varnish.</p>
    <p>Some of the author-practitioner’s observations are quite basic and
        essentially correct, such as his comparison of the skills required for
        working in oil- and water-based media on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/32r/f/32r/tl"><u>32r</u></a>,
        or his list of black pigments on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/58v/f/58v/tl"><u>58v</u></a>
        (to which I would add pyrolusite and tourmaline black, which I prefer
        for their crystalline qualities). His comment in “Painters” on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/9v/f/9v/tl"><u>9v</u></a>
        that “green earth” (<em>vert de terre</em>) should not be bound in oil
        is correct; it will change hue within five years.<a href="#fn4"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref4"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> Other general observations seem
        almost like ethnographic descriptions of the painter’s profession and
        practices, such as the marginal notes to “Painter” on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/56v/f/56v/tl"><u>56v</u></a>.
        These notes, which, for instance, contrast the working methods of the
        Italian and Flemish painters and remind one to wipe excess oil from the
        brush, “otherwise, the work would run &amp; would soon be all
        disfigured,” sound amusingly like the first lessons for an
        apprentice—this text could be used in most MFA courses today!<a
           href="#fn5"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref5"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> In other cases, the
        author-practitioner’s observations strike me as so obvious that they
        hardly need mentioning, such as the comment elsewhere on fol. 56v that
        “all marble on which a knife can prick is worth nothing for grinding
        fine colors.”</p>
    <p>Other entries are surprisingly complicated. A rather complex and curious
        method “for gilding on wood” is given on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/75v/f/75v/tl"><u>75v</u></a>,
        which involves improving the color of gold with the smoke of partridge
        feathers. Additionally, “Mastic varnish dry in a half hour” on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/97v/f/97v/tl"><u>97v</u></a>
        offers an unusually complex method of making what amounts to a
        problematic varnish. The final sentence of the entry says everything—it
        yellows. And, as with most of the varnish recipes the
        author-practitioner records, it would require extreme caution to make,
        since hot oils and resins easily auto-ignite. A recipe like “Varnish for
        lutes” on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/98r/f/98r/tl"><u>98r</u></a>
        requires extremely dangerous heat, as amber dissolves in oil at 700ºF.<a
           href="#fn6"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref6"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
    <p>A handful of entries are odd or confusing, such as the need for long
        paintbrushes when working “azure” (azurite?) on fresco—never mind the
        comment that fresco is not used on wood (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/58v/f/58v/tl"><u>58v</u></a>).
        The instruction in “Mirror” on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/65v/f/65v/tl"><u>65v</u></a>
        to “have a cristallin mirror” to hand when painting flesh colors is
        interesting. Indeed, looking at one’s own painting in a mirror can teach
        a painter quite a lot, although I doubt this is what is meant here. The
        advice about layering colors in “Neat work” on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/60r/f/60r/tl"><u>60r</u></a>
        is contradicted by much paint layer analysis in conservation literature.
        “Faces in distemper” on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/93v/f/93v/tl"><u>93v</u></a>,
        which presents an odd way of working with bistre, seems to contradict my
        experience that it can be controlled very well with colors in distemper.
        I found the recipe “For making varnish” on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/74r/f/74r/tl"><u>74r</u></a>–<a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/74v/f/74v/tl"><u>v</u></a>
        to be very strange; frankly, I cannot imagine how this varnish will
        work; moreover, “Another recipe for making varnish” on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/73v/f/73v/tl"><u>73v</u></a>
        would yield something questionable—this varnish will most probably
        yellow. Some entries are confusing for what was either missing or
        tacitly understood. I wondered whether a ground layer was assumed for
        the technique described in “Painting in distemper on wood” on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/66v/f/66v/tl"><u>66v</u></a>,
        since one would not paint with distemper directly on the panel.
        Similarly, some additional step must be understood in “For gilding on
        wood” on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/75v/f/75v/tl"><u>75v</u></a>,
        which instructs to apply a glue layer to the wood and to leave it to dry
        before putting down the layer of gold—yet presumably there still needs
        to be a tacky surface for the gold to adhere! Finally, some topics are
        simply unfamiliar to me, such as the methods described in “Painting on
        glass” on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/31v/f/31v/tl"><u>31v</u></a>
        and the manner of pressing walnut and almond oil in “Painter” on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/57v/f/57v/tl"><u>57v</u></a>.
    </p>
    <p>In some cases, the content of an entry is difficult to judge because the
        precise meaning of the terms used is uncertain, there are internal
        contradictions, or the process described is indecipherable. For
        instance, in “Thick varnish for planks” (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/3r/f/3r/tl"><u>3r</u></a>–v),
        the author-practitioner describes how garlic was boiled in oil “to
        extinguish it &amp; rid it of grease,” but the meaning of the term
        “extinguish” (<em>estaindre</em>) is unclear. There seem to be numerous
        contradictions in “For laying down and seating burnished gold and giving
        red or green or blue” on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/6r/f/6r/tl"><u>6r</u></a>
        as well as both bad and plausible advice. The instruction to “temper
        verdigris with walnut or linseed oil” is a disaster, guaranteed to turn
        brown, whereas the injunction to temper <em>azur d’esmail</em>, whether
        it is azurite or lapis lazuli, with “turpentine varnish” is correct—that
        is, if a fir-balsam resin varnish is meant. “Fatty colors” on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/65r/f/65r/tl"><u>65r</u></a>
        is difficult to understand and the intended outcome of “For varnishing”
        on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/3v/f/3v/tl"><u>3v</u></a>
        is uncertain, while “Flesh colors from arsenic” (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/13r/f/13r/tl"><u>13r</u></a>),
        “For layering gold in distemper” (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/32r/f/32r/tl"><u>32r</u></a>),
        and “Painter” (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/31v/f/31v/tl"><u>31v</u></a>)
        are difficult for me to evaluate without closer study or reconstruction.
        Despite my extensive experience making and using varnish, two varnish
        entries on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/4r/f/4r/tl"><u>4r</u></a>
        are challenging to judge. Regarding “Varnish of spike lavender oil,” one
        has to be extremely careful with spike oil of lavender. It is a
        brilliant solvent for removing colors bound in a fir-balsam resin.
        Varnishes consisting of sandarac in any oil will yellow considerably. I
        am not too sure what the result would be of dissolving mastic in
        turpentine as a varnish (presumably the fused fir-balsam resin with
        spirits of turpentine is meant—the ratio would probably work better with
        20 to 30% resin to 70 to 80% spirits of turpentine).<a href="#fn7"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref7"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> As for the entry “For removing
        varnish from an old panel that is yellowish,” it could work! Again the
        “turpentine varnish” (unknown exact mixture) could work. My own
        observation over the past 15 years would support the principle of fusing
        any fir-balsam resin with pure spirits of turpentine with at least a 1:1
        mixture. The question is still, do you add a little oil or mastic or
        sandarac to the “varnish”?</p>
    <p>If some recipes are odd and others difficult to evaluate, others still
        are simply too dangerous to try. I cannot recommend testing the recipe
        “For making vermilion” on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/74r/f/74r/tl"><u>74r</u></a>,
        which involves cooking sulfur and mercury in a lead pot (with provisions
        about what to do should it ignite!). “Painters” on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/9v/f/9v/tl"><u>9v</u></a>,
        which instructs to melt orpiment, an arsenic sulfide, is “crazy,”
        dangerous, and obviously was never applied in practice! (In addition,
        orpiment will never oxidize in any oil. The most beautiful golden yellow
        is achieved in a fir-balsam resin, with the inclusion of drops of walnut
        oil.)</p>
    <p>In many instances, however, the author-practitioner’s recipes and
        observations were consonant with my experience and research. When he
        uses the terms “turpentine” (<em>tourmentine</em>) and “turpentine oil”
        (<em>huile de tourmentine</em>), he can be understood to mean a
        fir-balsam resin and distilled turpentine respectively. His entry
        “Varnish for panels” on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/3r/f/3r/tl"><u>3r</u></a>
        is basically correct. Venice turpentine is a fir-balsam resin which is
        quite viscous and is diluted with a distilled turpentine (here
        turpentine oil). When heated together, which in this recipe is quite
        dangerous due to the flash-point, the two components are fused and do
        not separate again. It dries very quickly. It should be applied very
        thinly otherwise it could yellow. As a binding medium for pigments of
        low refractive index a fir-balsam resin (larch turpentine) fused 1:1
        with a double rectified turpentine (turpentine oil) is a perfect binding
        medium with a few drops of walnut oil mulled into the color. The entry
        “Varnish for distemper” (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/56r/f/56r/tl"><u>56r</u></a>)
        is a more difficult subject, since it depends on what is understood here
        as distemper—a variety of water-based binding mediums. A very diluted
        fir-balsam resin (roughly 80% pure spirits of turpentine fused with 20%
        fir-balsam resin—basically equivalent to Venice turpentine) would not
        affect the refractive index of most pigments bound in a distemper,
        although any layers of white pigments such as calcite would be altered
        slightly. Presumably the spike oil of lavender is the diluent for the
        resin, but pure spirits of turpentine as the diluent will probably work
        better than spike.<a href="#fn8"

           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/57r/f/57r/tl"><u>57r</u></a>),
        such as the note that lake pigments “lose their color &amp; die in the
        air” (56v), which is presumably due to oxidation or the UV effect on the
        dry pigment. The use of ground <em>cristallin</em> (glass) with lake
        (57r) is well documented in conservation literature.<a href="#fn9"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref9"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> When lake colors are bound in a
        fir-balsam resin and a few drops of oil (to avoid paint layer
        friability), the color is dry the following day. The observation a few
        lines later that ground vermilion is wan and pale unless it is ground
        after lake, suggests to me that he is using a manufactured vermilion
        that is not of high quality. “Colors in oil that are imbibed” on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/66r/f/66r/tl"><u>66r</u></a>
        instructs to use varnish to unify a paint surface with patches of shiny
        and matte color. Indeed, if too much oil is used when mulling a pigment,
        the colors will with time become dead and flat—even patchy.
        Nevertheless, varnish is only a temporary solution. Further, I would
        suggest that by “imbibed,” he means saturated. My experience also
        suggests that the entry “Drying of oil” on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/63r/f/63r/tl"><u>63r</u></a>
        is correct and that “Essential oils” on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/67v/f/67v/tl"><u>67v</u></a>
        seems to describe the process of adding a little walnut oil to a diluted
        fir-balsam resin, which dries remarkably quickly. Finally, my own studio
        practice reveals that the method of sabotaging a rival’s work described
        in “Spike lavender oil” on fol. <a

        would function extremely well, as pure spike lavender oil easily
        destroys colors to which it is applied (<i><u>Fig. 2</u></i>).</p>

    <p>Most exciting were those entries that struck me as worth trying out, such
        as “Varnish” on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/71v/f/71v/tl"><u>71v</u></a>
        and “Varnish of spike lavender oil” on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/4r/f/4r/tl"><u>4r</u></a>.
        Similarly, “Varnish dry in an hour” on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/60v/f/60v/tl"><u>60v</u></a>
        seems extremely difficult to produce from the instructions, as there are
        no quantities, but interesting nonetheless. I suspect it would yellow,
        but I have no experience with “eau-de-vie,” probably a strong alcohol,
        which could change the varnish chemistry enough not to yellow. Perhaps
        it is worth an experiment. Two entries (“Painter” on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/58r/f/58r/tl"><u>58r</u></a>
        and “Verdigris and another very beautiful bright green” on fol. <a

        call for grinding verdigris and orpiment with urine before binding them
        in oil in order to prevent the color from dying. I have never tried
        this—I wonder if it would work since these two colors cannot be bound in
        oil. It seems worth an experiment. I also find the author-practitioner’s
        comments about the uses of spike lavender oil on <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/57v/f/57v/tl"><u>57v</u></a>

        Problems: <em>Azure</em>, Imprimatura, and Lead Whites </h2>
    <p>My own interests and practice overlap with those of the
        author-practitioner and the Making and Knowing Project in three notable
        instances. I offer my response to the Project’s ongoing inquiries into
        the meaning of the term <em>azure</em> (and its variants <em>azur
            d’esmail</em>, <em>esmail d’azur</em>, etc.) and the terms that
        refer to ground layers in painting (<em>impression</em>,
        <em>assiete</em>, etc.). I also respond to the author-practitioner’s
        abiding interest in producing lead-based whites.</p>
    <h3 id="ambiguous-azur-desmail">Ambiguous <em>Azur d’Esmail</em></h3>
    <p>There has been much discussion among Making and Knowing Project members
        about the identity of the blues in Ms. Fr. 640, which might plausibly
        refer to lapis lazuli (<i><u>Fig. 3</u></i>), azurite (<i><u>Fig. 4</u></i>), or smalt.<a href="#fn10"

        keep some of the blues in their original French rather than translate
        them, most notably, the elusive <em>azur d’esmail</em>. Moreover, it is
        not clear that the author-practitioner is consistent in the way he
        refers to blue pigments, and so it is advisable to consider each entry

    <p>Already on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/10r/f/10r/tl"><u>10r</u></a>,
        in “Purple color,” we encounter different blues in the same entry:
        “making the first ground of common azure, or better yet <em>azur
            d’esmail</em>, &amp; next they glaze it with [red] lake.” Here,
        presumably, “common azure” may mean azurite and <em>azur d’esmail</em>
        lapis lazuli (although it could mean blue bice or smalt). The dye of the
        lake is likely precipitated on alum to produce the red lake pigment.
        Natural ultramarine (i.e., lapis lazuli) glazed with a red lake will
        produce a more beautiful purple compared to azurite and a red lake. This
        is not the only entry in which <em>azur d’esmail</em> points tentatively
        toward lapis. Consider “Azure” on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/93v/f/93v/tl"><u>93v</u></a>:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><em>Azur d’esmail</em> always wants to be cleaned, because the filth
            that can be perceived in the wash water makes it die. One needs to
            layer it two times, &amp; the first very thick, moving the
            paintbrush by layering it first lengthwise then across. It is better
            used on canvas, where it is imbibed immediately, than on wood.
            Varnish returns it to its vigor, because being imbibed, it becomes
            dark. To try it, painters bring their palette to the grocers, &amp;
            temper &amp; alloy it with a little white ground in oil, for in this
            way, the beautiful shows its turquine vivacity, but the bad is
            lavender grey. The most delicate is the best for working. It is
            thinned working by washing it.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>The first sentence seems to indicate lapis
        lazuli, since the crushed rock, when washed, produces particularly dirty
        water (<i><u>Fig. 5</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 6</u></i>). The difference
        between the dry pigment and pigment bound in oil is that the latter
        immediately becomes dark blue. However, the word “turquine” is confusing
        (as it typically has more to do with azurite), but again a lavender gray
        color is consistent with a lower quality of lapis lazuli.</p>

    <p>Despite these suggestions that <em>azur d’esmail</em> might refer to
        lapis, there is no cause to generalize. In “Painter” on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/56v/f/56v/tl"><u>56v</u></a>,
        the author-practitioner writes,</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>To use <em>azur d’esmail</em> in oil, one needs to choose the most
            delicate. And to render it subtle, one ought not to grind it, for
            this makes it whiten. But one needs to wash it, &amp; the coarsest
            going to the bottom, choose the one that is above in the water or,
            by inclination, pour out the cloudy water, then gather the azure.
        </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>It is truly difficult to know which blue
        is being referred to here. When either azurite or lapis lazuli are
        ground, they will always appear lighter (<i><u>Fig. 7</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 8</u></i>).</p>

    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>The difference is greater with azurite.
        The word “delicate,” as I suggest above, most probably refers to pigment
        that has already been prepared. If water is added to either color when
        the rock has been ground, one will produce a dirty blue-gray color (<i><u>Fig. 9</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 10</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 11</u></i>, <i><u>Vid. 1</u></i>). If the author is talking about a prepared
        pigment, then I would say that azurite is meant here, since further
        levigation, even if it is just using water, may produce the range of
        blue that is suggested. If, however, lapis lazuli is meant, and the
        extraction of lazurite from the lapis followed the “pastille” method,
        most famously described by Cennino Cennini, then the extraction process
        would already produce a variety of blues to blue-grays and the
        author-practitioner’s suggestion would have no validity.<a href="#fn11"

    <p>There are various blues to disentangle on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/59r/f/59r/tl"><u>59r</u></a>,
        in “Paintbrushes,” where the author-practitioner notes,</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>every kind of azure is difficult. And to make beautiful azure, one
            needs to layer it not with large strokes of the paintbrush but with
            small strokes of the point. Not only ash &amp; <em>azur d’Acre</em>
            but mainly <em>azur d’esmail</em> which one needs to choose to be
            very delicate, <del>for it</del> otherwise you will not <del>v</del>
            be able to work with it except with much work, and even then you
            need to allay it with turpentine to give it body, and mix it with a
            little lead white. Any azure wants neither to be ground nor washed
            for it loses color &amp; becomes pale. But putting it powdered on
            your palette, you will thin it little by little either with walnut
            oil or turpentine oil.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>Again the differences of blue are
        difficult to discern. “Azure” here seems to refer to azurite since one
        needs to layer it from small to large particles to achieve the deepest
        blue. However, it appears that <em>azur d’esmail</em> needs to be
        “delicate,” i.e., prepared. It makes no sense, then, to say that none of
        the blue pigments should be washed or ground because they become pale
        and loose color. Even with the purest crystals, preparation of the
        pigment is necessary. With any of the mineral blue pigments, it was
        common knowledge that adding a little lead white would reduce any
        discoloration in walnut oil. This part of the text is not from
        first-hand knowledge due to some basic confusion of pigment preparation
        and binding mediums.</p>
    <p>There is more to suggest that the author-practitioner’s knowledge of
        blues is indirect in “Azure” on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/58v/f/58v/tl"><u>58v</u></a>:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>The azure requires a little fatty oil because it has no body.</p>
        <p><em>Azur d’esmail</em> hates more than any other to be ground,
            especially with water, for it dies &amp; loses all its color.
            However, because it cannot be worked if it is coarse, grind not with

    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>This sounds like second-hand information
        and it is really unclear whether azurite or lapis lazuli is meant,
        though here too I take “delicate” to mean prepared pigment. Both azurite
        and lapis are the most stable in a fir-balsam resin fused 50-50 with
        spirits of turpentine, tempered with a few drops of walnut oil. When a
        few drops of oil are mulled into these pigments in resin, they suddenly
        have more body.<a href="#fn12"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref12"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> Too much oil and they discolor
        quite badly within a few years. The comment about grinding in water does
        not make much sense. If lapis lazuli raw stone is ground in water it
        appears to become gray, but this is due to release of impurities. Large
        particle azurite is difficult to work with, though this produces the
        deepest blue, but mulling it in oil makes it almost impossible to work
        with and the discoloration will be dreadful within two years.</p>
    <p>I am not confident that there is a neat resolution for the identity of
        <em>azur d’esmail</em>. The properties that the author-practitioner
        describes seem to refer plausibly sometimes to one pigment, sometimes to
        another, such as in the entry “<em>Azur d’esmail</em> in oil” on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/61v/f/61v/tl"><u>61v</u></a>,
        where it may be azurite, and in “Azure” on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/59r/f/59r/tl"><u>59r</u></a>,
        where it could be lapis lazuli. This ambiguity is compounded by the
        author-practitioner’s rather vague and sometimes confusing descriptions,
        which suggest that they do not derive from first-hand experience. If, in
        fact, he is collecting the practices and observations of various
        painters, then this could help explain the seeming inconsistencies in
        the meaning of <em>azur d’esmail</em>.</p>
    <h3 id="imprecise-imprimatura">Imprecise Imprimatura</h3>
    <p>The author-practitioner’s often imprecise directions for the preparation
        of panels and canvases once again suggests that his knowledge of
        painters’ practice is not first-hand. In some cases, his descriptions
        are clear and correct, such as in “First whitening of a panel” on fol.
        <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/60r/f/60r/tl"><u>60r</u></a>,
        where he writes,</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>One layers two or three times with chalk tempered with
            <sup>distemper</sup> glue on the panel, not with a paintbrush but
            with a brush in such a way as if you wanted to pounce, &amp; leave
            to dry. And reiterate up to two or three times, then even out the
            last ground well with a knife, <sup>then give a coat of glue on
                top,</sup> upon which you will next be able to make your
            imprimatura and then paint. But make sure that your first white is
            not too thick for it would break easily. Flemish painters have such
            panels made by the dozen.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>This advice is more or less the correct
        method of applying traditional gesso to a panel followed by the first
        imprimatura with a coat of (hide) glue. Also the gesso should become
        slightly thinner with each layer so as not to crack due to the tension
        between layers.</p>
    <p>Elsewhere, however, the author-practitioner is less precise with his use
        of “imprimatura” (<em>impression</em>). Consider his words in “Painter”
        on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/56v/f/56v/tl"><u>56v</u></a>:

        </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>There seems to be some confusion of
        terminology here regarding “imprimatura.” First of all, one needs a
        gesso ground of some description to paint on wood. There are numerous
        recipes for either chalk or gypsum gesso grounds. This then needs to be
        sealed either with a hide glue, if any tempera is to be used in the
        first layer, followed by a dilute fir-balsam resin with a little oil for
        any further paint layers in oils and/or resins. The particular
        imprimatura the author-practitioner describes here would be perfect for
        oil painting and, presumably since the ceruse is tempered in oil
        (preferably walnut), once dry, the slightly off-white could be a
        pleasant surface on which to work. It is important to have as little oil
        as possible in such an imprimatura to avoid yellowing. I would suggest
        here that ceruse refers to lead white, since cerussite would be too
        expensive and it yellows in walnut oil.<a href="#fn13"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref13"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
    <p>The author-practitioner’s vagueness about the kind of imprimatura he
        intends raises some issues for interpretation. In “Drawing” on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/62v/f/62v/tl"><u>62v</u></a>,
        he notes that “when the imprimatura has been long done, it becomes
        greasy. One needs to rub it with ash &amp; water.” This is a correct
        observation, but again it depends on the imprimatura. If it is a
        glue-size, it will have become completely water-proof after about a
        month and may be difficult to do the initial preparatory drawing.
        Ambiguity about the kind of imprimatura continues, in “Semi-lively
        colors” on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/65v/f/65v/tl"><u>65v</u></a>:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>When colors <del>a</del>absorb into the canvas, it means that it has
            been given imprimatura only once, &amp; for this reason they become
            matte rather than <sup>being</sup> shiny. But this is the best, as
            long as you re-coat it twice, for in this manner, the colors, having
            more body, do not die &amp; are all the more beautiful for it,
            especially azure, lake, &amp; those do not have body. But those who
            want to rush their painting apply imprimatura twice on the first go,
            to be done with it. Thus the colors do not absorb, also they will
            not last as long. The second layer of these does not absorb &amp;
            remains shiny.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>There is an important point here, but the
        author-practitioner is not specific. The imprimatura will vary according
        to the binding medium of the first paint layer or layers. Before working
        with resin-oil, the painting needs to be sealed again, with a diluted
        fir-balsam resin with a drop of oil and allowed to dry for a couple of
        days. In this way the following paint layers will not sink in and become
        dull.</p>
    <h3 id="loose-lead-whites">Loose Lead Whites</h3>
    <p>In a handful of entries, the author-practitioner discusses various white
        pigments, most often “lead white” (<em>blanc de plomb</em>) and “ceruse”
        (<em>ceruse</em>). While “ceruse” was used in the seventeenth century to
        refer to “any white pigment made from tin or lead plates,”<a
           href="#fn14"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref14"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> the author-practitioner must
        have had a different meaning in mind; in “Painter,” on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/57r/f/57r/tl"><u>57r</u></a>,
        he notes that “lead white [<em>blanc de plomb</em>] is made with plate
        lead, beaten thin &amp; put under the dung heap.” Earlier in the same
        entry (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/56v/f/56v/tl"><u>56v</u></a>),
        he contrasts the two pigments:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Chalk has no body in oil. Ceruse is appropriate. But lead white more
            excellent. Ceruse is the whitest, when ground first in water, the
            lead white grayish. But the white it takes on its perfect whiteness
            in oil.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>This comment does not come from the
        author-practitioner’s personal experience and is somewhat contradictory.
        It would appear that “ceruse” here refers to the mineral cerussite (<i><u>Fig. 12</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 13</u></i>), and a comparison is made
        with manufactured lead white. However, in period texts, sometimes
        “ceruse” does refer to a Venetian lead white, which was often regarded
        as the most brilliant lead white available. However, since the most
        brilliant white identified in Titian’s paintings was cerussite, I think
        it is reasonable to assume that we are comparing cerussite with lead
        white.<a href="#fn15"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref15"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> In addition, when preparing
        either cerussite or lead white, both are ground as finely as possible
        and washed. There are many methods for levigation, and by producing a
        froth with a little hide glue or gum or casein in water, the finest
        particles will float and can be poured off (<i><u>Fig. 14</u></i>). This
        will ensure the best and most brilliant white. These whites are the most
        stable in walnut oil and fir-balsam resin binders. The mineral
        cerussite, when used on its own, must be bound in a fir-balsam
        resin/spirit of turpentine binder with eye-drops of oil. Bound in walnut
        oil alone, it will yellow within one to two years.</p>

    <p>Similarly on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/10v/f/10v/tl"><u>10v</u></a>,
        in the entry “For whitening ceruse,” it is difficult to know whether a
        manufactured lead white or the mineral cerussite is meant. However, the
        mineral cerussite when finely ground does produce a white that is more
        brilliant (<i><u>Fig. 15</u></i>) than lead white produced by corroding
        strips of lead to produce “flake white” (<i><u>Fig. 16</u></i>). As
        noted above, Titian is an example for his brilliant white from
        cerussite, which he most probably procured from his native Dolomites in
        north Italy.</p>

    <p>In other instances, the author-practitioner calls for “lead white,” such
        as in “Painter” on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/57v/f/57v/tl"><u>57v</u></a>,
        where he notes that “the Flemish do not use any whites for flesh colors
        in oil other than lead white because the ceruse turns yellow. 4- or
        5-year-old walnut oil which is clear is the best color, it keeps off
        dust.” Here, however, we encounter the confusion of terminology for
        white pigments. The “ceruse” in this case may refer not to the lead
        white manufactured from plates but to cerussite, as this comment is
        correct insofar as cerussite bound in just oil alone, even walnut oil,
        turns yellow within one to two years. There seems to be less confusion
        in “Dessicative,” on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/59v/f/59v/tl"><u>59v</u></a>,
        where we read, “lead white &amp; massicot are the most desiccative,
        nevertheless they need a good two days. If you want to prove whether an
        oil is desiccative, temper lead white with it, &amp; if it produces a
        crust <del>in a day</del> soon it means that it will dessicate.” While I
        am not too sure about the use of “dessicate” here (is the oxidation of
        the oil meant?), lead white in any oil indeed speeds up the paint layer
        drying.</p>
    <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>After surveying the entries devoted to painting and varnishes, I am left
        with the overwhelming impression that the author-practitioner was not a
        painter. He has compiled a variety of “instructions,” some of which may
        have come from his own experience, but due to the lack of details when
        dealing with some pigments, it becomes clear that the experience of
        others is being recorded. Some entries even suggest this by their more
        distant and vaguely descriptive phrasing, such as “Oil” on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/60r/f/60r/tl"><u>60r</u></a>
        or “Faces in distemper” on fol. <a

           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref16"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> But in many cases, my years of
        experience as an artist who works with natural pigments suggest that the
        author-practitioner did not try out many of the painting recipes with
        his own hands. If, for instance, he had actually tried to make lead
        white “with plate lead, beaten thin &amp; put under the dung heap,” as I
        have done, he would have known that the process is not that simple, and
        he would have provided additional details. In any case, it is not a
        process I would recommend especially in the city, or for one with a
        sensitive nose! Finally, with regard to writing down recipes as clearly
        and concisely as possible, I receive emails from artists worldwide with
        questions about a variety of processes in my publications. Fortunately,
        I am still around to answer their questions whereas with most texts and
        manuscripts we do not have that luxury.</p>
