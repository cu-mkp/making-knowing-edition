            <p>A three-line entry on fol. <a

                notes the material qualities, ornamentation, and use of
                metalpoint tablets or “writing tables.” This essay seeks to
                understand the physical characteristics of the tablet that the
                author-practitioner had in mind and the context in which he
                might have used it. The essay surveys the history of tablets,
                from ancient and medieval wooden tablets inlaid with wax to
                early modern varieties made of coated paper and parchment for
                writing and metalpoint drawing. Several contemporary manuscripts
                feature recipes for a ground that could be applied to different
                supports, written on with a metal stylus, erased, and reused. As
                the author-practitioner makes no mention of any ground, the
                reconstruction examines possible reasons for such an omission.
                The essay speculates that the author-practitioner may have used
                a tablet like the one he describes—perhaps an erasable notebook
                made by an expert in which he could record his observations
                temporarily before he transferred them to his final manuscript.

    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
    <p>For the twenty-first-century reader, “tablet” is a multivalent word,
        evoking objects from Moses’s stone tablets inscribed with the Ten
        Commandments, to the ancient wooden tablets excavated in the last two
        decades in South Korea,<a href="#fn1"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref1"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> to modern computer tablets in all
        shapes and sizes. The common denominator of all these objects is their
        flat surface for writing. The same holds true for the
        author-practitioner’s entry on “tablets,” which is a three-line
        description of some features of a flat writing surface, including the
        materials that constitute it, its ornamentation and its use.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>
            <strong>Tablets</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Some are made from boxwood inlaid with ebony, sandalwood, ivory, or
            gold and silver like damascening. Then one writes on it with
            silverpoint, and next erases it with a cuttlefish bone by rubbing
            them (fol. <a
               href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/15v/f/15v/tl"><u>15v</u></a>).
        </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>Although seemingly straightforward, the
        entry raises questions about the object’s construction, the
        functionality of its writing surface, and why it was included in BnF Ms.
        Fr. 640. This essay aims to understand the meaning of the word “tablet”
        as it was understood by the author-practitioner in sixteenth-century
        France. (<i><u>Fig. 1</u></i>)</p>

    <p>Randle Cotgrave’s <em>A Dictionarie of the French and English
            Tongues</em> defines <em>tablette</em> as “[a] little table, or
        boord; also a childes horne-booke,” and the plural, <em>tablettes</em>,
        as “writing tables.”<a href="#fn2"

           id="fnref2"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> The Oxford English Dictionary
        records historical definitions of the word “table,” among them, “a small
        portable tablet for writing upon, esp. for notes or memoranda; a writing

           class="footnote-ref"

           role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> while it defines “tablet” as “a
        smooth stiff sheet for writing on, usually one of two or more fastened
        together, originally made of clay or wax-covered wood, later of ivory,
        cardboard, etc.; a number of such sheets fastened together.”<a

           role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> The close connection between the
        two terms—“table” and “tablet”—demonstrates that they were used
        interchangeably, to designate a flat surface for writing on.</p>
    <p>A comparison of the entry to others in Ms. Fr. 640 reveals its
        singularity. This is the only time that the author-practitioner mentions
        the term “silverpoint” (<em>poincte dargent</em>)—a silver stylus that
        was used for writing and drawing and which is associated with an
        artistic technique that flourished in Renaissance Europe.<a href="#fn5"

           id="fnref5"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> In addition, this is the only use
        of wood as a support for writing; other entries that refer to writing

        does not discuss the process of making a tablet, but only describes its
        appearance. He does not elaborate on the technique of drawing with
        silverpoint, or any other metalpoint, nor does he mention that using a
        metalpoint necessitates preparing the support with a ground, as other
        contemporary authors do. The details that the author-practitioner
        discloses, as well as those which he neglects to include, raise
        questions about the degree of his acquaintance with the use of tablets
        and the technique of metalpoint drawing. Exploring the historical
        composition of tablets, their material qualities, and the different
        contexts in which they were used, in addition to reconstructing the
        recipe, will assist us in understanding the place of the recipe within
        Ms. Fr. 640 as well as within early modern European culture.</p>
    <h2 id="historical-context-tablets">Historical Context: Tablets</h2>
    <p>Textual, archeological, and visual evidence demonstrates that tablets
        were a common writing surface from the late Bronze-Age Near East through
        Greek and Latin antiquity. Ancient tablets were usually made of wood,
        had a small raised frame around the edges of the tablet and often
        featured a recessed center containing a thin layer of wax; they are
        therefore often referred to in the literature as “wax tablets.” The
        supporting material had to be sturdy enough to provide a firm base for
        the wax layer and sustain the action of writing but lightweight enough
        to be portable. From antiquity, boxwood was preferred for this purpose
        because of its fine, dense grain. Other tablets that did not feature a
        wax layer were made of a light-colored support or were colored with a
        white substance such as white pigment wash, gesso, plaster, or stucco to
        allow for ink writing to stand out (I will refer to them as “whitened
        tablets”). Tablets could be joined together to form diptychs and
        polyptychs, but they could also be used alone. Their sizes varied, from
        small and medium-size tablets that could be held in the hand, to large
        tablets that had to be balanced on the thigh while writing upon them.<a

    <p>Wax tablets were written on with styluses made from hard materials such
        as bone, ivory, horn, wood, iron, or precious metals, which were capable
        of incising marks into the wax. Marks could be erased by heating the wax
        and smoothing the surface, a quality that allowed wax tablets to be
        reused. Ink writing on whitened tablets could also be erased by applying
        another layer of white ground to cover it. Consequently, both types of
        tablets served for ephemeral activities: to learn and practice writing,
        to write drafts, lists, and accounts that would be later transferred to
        a permanent support, or to send a letter and receive an immediate reply
        on the same surface. Only in Mesopotamia were wax tablets used as the
        final support for literary texts, as demonstrated by the Nimrud tablets
        that were discovered in excavations in 1953.<a href="#fn11"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref11"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
    <p>Wax tablets made of boxwood, bone, ivory or metal continued to be widely
        used in medieval Europe. Sets of tablets hinged together usually had all
        interior leaves coated with green, red or yellow wax on both sides. (<i><u>Fig. 3</u></i>) Still serving as they did in antiquity for
        ephemeral activities, medieval tablets were also used to make drafts of
        musical compositions and were a central pedagogical instrument for
        teaching children the alphabet. Andrea Morgan argues that “wax tablets
        were alternatives to expensive parchment, thus allowing everyday people
        to participate in the act of writing.”<a href="#fn12"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref12"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> Peter Stallybrass and his
        co-authors argue that the decline of wax tablets coincided with the
        increased use of paper in Europe. While wax tablets were still common in
        England and Germany in the sixteenth century, they were rare in Spain
        and Italy, where the paper industry developed earlier. Although paper
        eventually became cheaper than wax tablets, it was not sufficiently
        inexpensive to displace more durably erasable materials until the
        invention of wood-pulp paper in the nineteenth century. From the
        sixteenth century on, erasable paper or parchment tablets (or “tables”)
        came to the fore.<a href="#fn13"

    <p>“Tables,” “table-books,” or “writing tables” were an alternative to wax
        tablets in early modern Europe. Essentially, they were portable
        notebooks or sketchbooks of blank paper or parchment leaves coated with
        a ground of gesso and glue, and they could be written on, erased, and
        then reused. (<i><u>Fig. 4</u></i>) These tables were usually bound by a
        leather cover, and some were conveniently clasped shut with a metal
        stylus. Frequently, although not always, white-coated leaves were bound
        into printed texts for note taking.<a href="#fn14"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref14"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> (<i><u>Fig. 5</u></i>) Writing
        tables bound with printed texts were manufactured and sold on a large
        scale especially in the Low Countries and Germany. The earliest writing
        table that Stallybrass et al. have traced was manufactured in 1527 in
        Antwerp, and bound with a printed almanac.<a href="#fn15"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref15"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> From the late 1520s, tables were

           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref16"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> Writing tablets often included
        charts of weights, measurements, and distances, pictures of coins, and
        calculation instructions; these proved especially useful for merchants,
        who—as Cennino d’Andrea Cennini mentions in his <em>Libro dell’Arte</em>
        of 1390—were users of coated-parchment tablets.<a href="#fn17"

        could be purchased by all literate social groups thanks to their wide
        range in price, and they were used for various purposes, as were the wax
        tablets mentioned above. Some writing tables were very simple, while
        others featured luxurious bindings, which included gold, silver, and

    <p>Writing tables were convenient because they could be used on the go.
        Until the fountain pen was invented in the mid-seventeenth century,
        writing on paper with ink required a quill pen and an open ink
        container; it was therefore impossible while standing or travelling, or
        without an organized writing setup.<a href="#fn19"

           id="fnref19"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a> Writing tablets, by contrast,
        needed only a metal stylus, usually a silverpoint, to write on its
        prepared leaves of paper or parchment, which rendered ink and its
        inconveniences unnecessary. The traces that metalpoint styluses left on
        a table could be easily erased, thus making it reusable.<a href="#fn20"

    <h2 id="historical-context-metalpoint">Historical Context: Metalpoint</h2>
    <p>The term “metalpoint” refers not only to a thin metal stylus, but also to
        the technique of drawing with it and the image that it produces. The
        technique of metalpoint drawing is associated with the Italian
        Renaissance, although it was also practiced intermittently in Northern
        Europe between the mid-fourteenth and the eighteenth centuries.<a
           href="#fn21"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref21"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a> (<i><u>Fig. 8</u></i>) In fact,
        metalpoint drawing is still practiced today. Metalpoint styluses could
        be made of silver, copper, lead, and a variety of alloys. The
        composition of the metal affects the properties of the stylus, the way
        its traces “flow” on paper, and the tone it creates. Strictly speaking,
        the term “silverpoint,” therefore, refers to a stylus made of silver, or
        at least one with a silver-coated tip. Since pure silver was usually too
        soft, an alloy of silver and copper or mercury was commonly used.<a

    <p>The technique of metalpoint was used on different supports: wooden
        tablets, parchment, and paper. Crucially, in order that a metalpoint
        drawing appear on its support, its surface had to be prepared with a
        special ground, typically made of calcined bone and an adhesive
        substance. Such a ground was usually white but could be tinted by the
        addition of a pigment. (<i><u>Fig. 9</u></i>) Thea Burns explains that
        “grounds are necessary for drawing in silverpoint because the surface of
        unprepared paper is not sufficiently abrasive to detach from the drawing
        stylus the fine deposit of silver particles that constitutes the
        distinctive drawn line.”<a href="#fn23"

    <p>Metalpoint drawings on ivory or wooden tablets, coated with a white
        ground instead of wax, survive from the late Middle Ages onward.<a
           href="#fn25"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref25"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a> Ernst van de Wetering argues
        that these tablets were used between the fourteenth and seventeenth
        centuries, mainly as erasable supports for apprentice artists to
        practice on. Compared to the dark color of wax, the white ground on the
        wooden tablets, drawn on with metal styluses that created dark lines,
        must have been experienced as a great improvement, he presumes.<a
           href="#fn26"

           id="fnref26"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a> Van de Wetering’s thesis is
        supported by the first couple of pages from Cennini’s <em>Libro
            dell’Arte</em>, which are devoted to the preparation of a white
        ground made of bone ash mixed with saliva to be applied to either a
        boxwood panel, a panel of fig wood, or a piece of parchment, and then to
        be drawn on with a metal stylus. The location of this recipe at the
        beginning of Cennini’s book suggests that this is the most basic
        technique used by beginner artists. Cennini suggests that one should
        practice this technique for about a year before one turns to draw with a
        pen on paper.<a href="#fn27"

    <p>Yet metalpoint drawing was also practiced by master artists, who
        exploited the technique for its particular advantages. Art historians
        have characterized metalpoint as “a linear medium often used to capture
        subtle effects of light and render forms precisely with lines of
        astonishing delicacy.”<a href="#fn29"

           id="fnref29"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a> Skilled artists often combined
        metalpoint with other materials at their disposal, such as pen and ink,
        brush and color washes, chalks, and charcoal. (<i><u>Fig. 10</u></i>)
        Burns argues that some artists may have chosen metalpoint in an attempt
        to reconstruct what they believed to be the appearances of ancient
        drawings. Since no artifactual evidence of drawing from antiquity
        existed in the early modern period, artists sought their traces in other
        sources, such as in ancient literature, on decorated vases, and on metal
        and stone artifacts.<a href="#fn30"

    <p>The numerous surviving recipes for a basic white ground for tablets,
        which appear in manuscripts from the period, suggest that this technique
        was common. Some recipes refer directly to the erasability of the
        surface, supporting van de Wetering’s assumption that Cennini’s ground
        could be easily removed. The <em>Secretum philosophorum</em>, a popular
        Latin text originating in England c.1300-1350, includes a recipe “to
        make white tablets,” which explains how to apply a mixture of linseed
        oil and white lead onto calf parchment, and when</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>this [is] done, shape from these leaves: make tablets of whatever
            size you wish, and use them as you please. And know that you may
            write on these tablets with a stylus of lead or of tin or of silver,
            just like on other tablets. You may also write on them with ink,
            just like on parchment, and erase the letters with saliva.<a

    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>This recipe was followed by one for glue,
        perhaps implying that such whitened parchment was to be adhered to a
        wooden support.<a href="#fn32"

        pencil or stile [stylus) of gold, silver … as is done upon panels of
        boxwood,” which explains how to make a mixture of white bone ash and
        size or glue to coat a surface for drawing.<a href="#fn34"

        brush and water.<a href="#fn35"

        interchangeability of the different supports: the same ground could be
        applied to wood, parchment, and paper. Similarly, a tablet could be made

        appearance of such recipes in manuscript compilations of artists’
        materials and techniques suggests that preparing a support for a tablet
        was quite a usual process in artisanal workshops, in which materials
        such as bone ash and adhesive substances were regularly available.</p>
    <p>Because of their erasable surfaces for drafting and drawing, surviving
        tablets have been interpreted as either model books or sketchbooks. Van
        de Wetering has analyzed a curious series of artifacts: small pieces of
        parchment prepared on both sides, which appear to have been cut from a
        larger whole and often feature a meticulous metalpoint drawing on one
        side. He argues that in most of the cases, the drawings were only
        partially finished, with the head of the figure extremely elaborated and
        the rest only scantily defined. Some of these were finished by a later
        hand, though some bear traces of earlier use. These pieces were most
        likely parts of tablets, small booklets, which could be carried in the
        artist’s pocket and used to make drafts or quick notes when outside of
        the workshop.<a href="#fn36"

            prepared with bonemeal, and with a silverpoint briefly note the

        ebony and ivory. The author-practitioner does not describe the shape of
        the tablet: is it a single leaf, a diptych, or a booklet? Does the
        boxwood function as an exterior cover for paper or parchment leaves? Or
        is boxwood the main support on which writing would be carried out? The
        details that the author-practitioner gives are not sufficient to
        determine the answer. Is the author-practitioner’s tablet more similar
        to the premade writing tables that could be purchased or received as a
        gift, or is it more like the erasable support made by apprentices in
        their masters’ workshops? The language of the author-practitioner, “some
        are made from boxwood” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/15v/f/15v/tl"><u>15v</u></a>),
        may suggest that he only observed other people’s tablets and had not
        used one himself. The lack of information about grounds could point to
        his superficial knowledge of the technique. On the other hand, the
        prevalence of ground recipes in other contemporary sources makes it
        difficult to imagine that the author-practitioner was unaware of the
        need for a coating; it seems more likely that he took this for granted.
        Another possibility, which I explore in my reconstruction, is that,
        contrary to the scholarly literature, a ground was not always necessary
        for writing with silverpoint, and therefore the author-practitioner did
        not mention it.</p>
    <p>The main purpose of my reconstruction was to understand the physical
        characteristics of the tablet that the author-practitioner had in mind
        and the context in which he might have used it. As a starting point, I
        decided to conduct the investigation along two trajectories, each
        relying on a different assumption. The first one considered that the
        author-practitioner’s description of the components of a tablet was
        accurate and sufficient, and that one could use a tablet exactly as he
        describes it. The second hypothesis was that the author-practitioner
        neglected to mention important aspects of the tablet and its use, either
        because he was not aware of them or because he took them for granted.
        Since the manuscript entry in question is not a typical instructional
        recipe but more of a general description, the reconstruction required
        extracting details from the entry as well as from external sources.</p>
    <p>Following the first trajectory, I assumed that writing would be carried
        out on the boxwood itself and that the other expensive materials
        (sandalwood, ebony, ivory, gold, and silver) would serve to decorate the
        frame or the exterior of the tablet. Since the author-practitioner
        mentions no ground, I examined the viability of writing directly on the
        boxwood block. The second trajectory led me to examine two additional
        options: 1) that a ground would have been applied to the boxwood, or 2)
        that additional leaves would have been added to the boxwood, e.g.,
        coated paper or parchment, to assemble a “writing table.” Consequently,
        this second examination included applying a ground to boxwood, paper,
        and parchment. The reconstruction consisted of three stages: preparing
        the support, writing on it, and erasing it.</p>
    <p>Two recipes for a white ground were chosen for comparison, based on the
        recipes of Cennini (Ground 1) and Alcherius (Ground 2), mentioned above.
        Both called for the use of bone ash, while the adhesive substance varied
        between saliva (Ground 1) and rabbit skin glue (Ground 2). I had two
        boxwood blocks on which I could examine the application of ground.
        Consequently, I was able to use one of them to test Cennini’s
        instructions to wash the boxwood panel and rub it with cuttlefish bone
        before applying the ground.<a href="#fn40"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref40"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>40</sup></a> This step proved to be valuable
        for the reconstruction results, detailed below. I divided the two
        boxwood blocks in a way that allowed me to apply a ground to two thirds
        of each block’s surface, and leave one third without a ground (<i><u>Fig. 12</u></i>). In addition, I prepared three pieces of
        parchment so that I had one coated with each of the two grounds and one
        with no ground. I did the same with three pieces of paper.<a

           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref41"

        each support with two types of silver—pure silver and sterling silver.<a

        writing and erasing on the same supports to test my first observations
        and to examine the materials’ durability. As a final step to verify my
        results, I repeated the process of applying Ground 1 (saliva and bone
        ash) on boxwood and parchment, wrote on them, and erased them again with
        both media.</p>

    <p>The results of the experiment were surprising: I discovered that I was
        able to write on each of the supports, with or without a ground,
        although the amount of force I had to use to obtain a mark on the
        support and the quality of the results differed.<a href="#fn44"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref44"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>44</sup></a> (<i><u>Fig. 13</u></i>) (<i><u>Fig. 14</u></i>) (<i><u>Fig. 15</u></i>) The most convenient
        support for writing and drawing with either silver stylus was parchment
        coated with Ground 1. As to the coated surfaces, generally, Ground 1
        (saliva and bone ash) was easier to make and apply; it was equally easy
        to remove by both cuttlefish bone and bread. Ground 2 (rabbit skin glue
        and bone ash) was more difficult to produce, since it required heating
        and waiting for the layers of ground to dry. In addition, its
        consistency and texture as a ground did not make writing easy, and I had
        to use much more force to write on it. However, I presume that my
        inexperience preparing the ground and achieving the ideal consistency
        might have affected my results; further iterations of making and
        applying Ground 2 might improve its function as a support for metalpoint
        writing. Nevertheless, Ground 2, as I prepared it, was more difficult to
        erase; neither the silver marks nor the ground itself were easily
        removed by erasing. (<i><u>Fig. 16</u></i>)</p>

    <p>As to the uncoated surfaces, writing with silver on the flesh side of a
        piece of uncoated parchment was not only convenient but also most
        effective. On the hair side of the parchment, the silver left only
        colorless scratches. Writing with silver on paper was not easy, although
        pure silver, which is softer, created silver marks better than the
        silver alloy. As to the use of silverpoint on boxwood, writing on a
        clean block seemed almost impossible, and the lines that I managed to
        create were visible only from a certain angel of light. In contrast,
        writing on a clean block that had been rubbed with cuttlefish bone (per
        Cennini) was much easier, as if the cuttlefish bone particles functioned
        as a ground. Nevertheless, in my overall experience, writing was still
        most comfortable and effective with Ground 1. (<i><u>Fig. 17</u></i>) (<i><u>Fig. 18</u></i>)</p>

    <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The results of the reconstruction confirmed that both hypotheses are
        viable: following the author-practitioner’s spare description could
        yield results, but supplementing information from other sources (namely,
        the need to coat the support with a ground) also led to a successful
        outcome. The author-practitioner mentions cuttlefish bone in the entry.
        It is possible that he used cuttlefish bone both as a simple ground
        (through dry rubbing on the surface of the boxwood) and an erasing
        medium in order to write directly on a boxwood block. At the same time,
        I imagine that using the technique of applying bone ash mixed with
        saliva (Ground 1) on any support would have been very easy and
        convenient for any apprentice or artisan in the workshop. Although the
        author-practitioner does not mention it in the “tablets” entry, bones in
        general and calcined bones in particular appear in the manuscript
        numerous times.<a href="#fn45"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref45"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>45</sup></a> This strengthens the suggestion
        that the author-practitioner took a bone ash ground for granted. Ground
        2, on the other hand, seems more durable and suitable for a notebook in
        which the leaves are prepared in advance and are easy to write on
        quickly. Although it is possible that artisans made their own erasable
        notebooks, the unskilled person could turn to an expert to make and even
        repair his or her tablet, as is evident from the title page of a Flemish
        almanac:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>you may write here with a stylus of gold, silver, tin, copper, or
            brass, and you may erase [what you have written] with a wet finger.
            And when you have worn out [the erasable surface], so that you
            cannot write on it any more, you can get it repaired by Jan
            Severszoon, parchment maker, for a little money, and you can then
            write on it as well as if it were new.<a href="#fn46"
               class="footnote-ref"
               id="fnref46"
               role="doc-noteref"><sup>46</sup></a></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>It is possible that the
        author-practitioner used a premade notebook, and hence never dealt with
        applying a ground.</p>
    <p>Although all these scenarios are equally plausible, my intuition based on
        the historical research and hands-on experiment leads me to favor the
        conclusion that the author-practitioner used a premade writing tablet
        that he purchased or received as a gift. If he were interested in
        practicing metalpoint drawing on a reusable support, it would have made
        sense to use any of the recipes mentioned above (and especially Ground
        1) to recoat the tablet himself. However, this entry is the only time he
        mentions silverpoint in the manuscript, and in the context of writing
        rather than drawing. It seems more plausible that the entry refers to
        one of these widespread portable notebooks named “writing tables.” Such
        a notebook could have served him to record his observations quickly and
        ephemerally, before he transferred them to his final, clean support.
        Moreover, the author-practitioner dedicates almost half of the entry to
        describing the luxurious appearance of the tablet, which might indicate
        that he was more interested in its decoration than its practical use. As
        I mentioned earlier, writing tables with luxurious bindings were common
        as gifts among the elite. (<i><u>Fig. 19</u></i>) It is
        conceivable that the author-practitioner had received such a tablet as a
        prestigious present from a patron, or that he was used to pulling one
        out of his pocket to record quickly the results of his investigations.
        Has the “tablets” recipe given us a peek into the life of the
        author-practitioner? This question, like many others, will remain open.

                    exact composition of the silver he used, I decided to use
                    two types of silver that were most likely used at that
                    period: pure silver (which I obtained in the form of a

                    the silver-copper alloy common at that time (obtained in the
                    form of a needle). Dahm, “The Stylus Revealed,” 80–81.<a
