            <p>This essay explores what we can learn about daily life in early
                modern France through a close reading of BnF Ms. Fr. 640.
                Reading across instructions, observations, and marginal
                illustrations, it reveals everyday practices, local proverbs,
                beliefs, and material culture, contributing to our understanding
                of the cultural, physical, conceptual, and material environment
                of early modern Europe.</p>

    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>What was the daily life of the
        author-practitioner of BnF Ms. Fr. 640? What objects did he interact
        with as he went about his work and life somewhere in or near Toulouse in
        the 1580s? Did he follow his own advice for a daily regime and wake up
        each morning, take eggs that he had collected in advance and crack them
        open, dust sugar over the yolks, and sip a small amount of wine to
        settle his stomach? And what does his inclusion of such information in
        the manuscript tell us about his interests and preoccupations?
        Information about the rhythms and practices of everyday life and
        material culture in early modern Europe is spread thinly across a wide
        range of archival, printed, visual, and material sources. Ms. Fr. 640 is
        not primarily about daily life or everyday material culture in early
        modern Europe. Here, as with most manuscript sources from the sixteenth
        century, mentions of daily practices and material culture are found as
        asides, they are a thin dust of sugar on the yolk of information about
        craft practice. But by closely reading the manuscript for what it tells
        us about material and quotidian life in early modern Toulouse, we can
        learn much about the rhythms of social, religious, and economic life for
        artisans and the material surroundings of people across Europe in the
        late sixteenth century. Such insights contribute to our understanding of
        the cultural, physical, conceptual, and material environments of early
        modern Europe, and they cast more light on the still shadowy figure of
        the author-practitioner.</p>
    <h2 id="writing">Writing</h2>
    <p>An unattributed pen-and-ink sketch of a bearded man, now stored in the
        collections of The Metropolitan Museum of Art, offers an image of the
        educated male writer in late sixteenth-century France (<i><u>Fig. 1</u></i>). He is hunched forwards to write at a desk in an elegant room,
        shutters flung open to let in the light. On the table, a fashionable
        beaver hat has been placed to his left, marking him out as a stylish
        dresser, confirmed by his neat ruff and pinked hose. At the table, a
        leather pen case is open, and its writing utensils have spilled out and
        lie next to a sand blotter, several bound books, and loose leaves. The
        room is rather sparsely furnished, the ceiling has bare wooden boards
        and a beam, but the chair is patterned perhaps in tooled leather, and
        the wall to the right is decorated perhaps with a tapestry or stucco,
        wood carving, painted decoration, or fresco. While we do not know the
        economic or social status of the author-practitioner and so cannot
        conjure up a clear image of his milieu, as so many of the materials
        depicted in this sketch are also mentioned throughout the manuscript,
        this image offers a visual account of many of the objects created and
        used by the author-practitioner and gives us an impression of what a
        writer might look like in late sixteenth-century France.</p>

    <p>We get limited insight into the author-practitioner’s life as a writer,
        as there is little self-reflexivity about the practice of writing in Ms.
        Fr. 640. What tools he used, and where and at what time of day he wrote,
        are still unknown to us. It seems as if the text was not compiled in one
        sitting but over a period of time, so for at least part of his
        life—days, months, or even years—the author-practitioner made writing
        part of his routine.<a href="#fn2"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref2"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> Perhaps he took notes on a
        tablet, as he describes in one entry how it is possible to write with
        silverpoint on a tablet and erase your writing by rubbing it with a
        cuttlefish bone. While this would have been a practical tool, he also
        writes down that tablets can be decorated with a range of materials,
        “Some are made from boxwood inlaid with ebony, sandalwood, ivory, or
        gold and silver like damascening” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/15v/f/15v/tl"><u>15v</u></a>).<a
           href="#fn3"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref3"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> He mentions preparing quills to
        make paintbrushes, and it seems likely that he gathered and shaped his
        own quills for writing (fols. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/66v/f/66v/tl"><u>66v</u></a>–<a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/67r/f/67r/tl"><u>67r</u></a>).
        He does not include a recipe for a standard iron gall ink, which is
        likely what he used to write the manuscript, suggesting that the recipe
        was so commonplace that it was unremarkable to him, but he does offer
        recipes for unusual inks, such as one for printers (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/51r/f/51r/tl"><u>51r</u></a>).<a
           href="#fn4"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref4"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> In an entry entitled “Scribe,” he
        describes how a writer can quickly clean dried ink from his quill using
        oil of sulfur, sulfur being a material that appears to have been
        significant to him not only for its many uses across the manuscript’s
        entries but perhaps also as a material metaphor for experimentation
        itself (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/46v/f/46v/tl"><u>46v</u></a>).<a
           href="#fn5"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref5"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> On the same page, he suggests
        using heated oil of sulfur for “writing without ink,” following this
        instruction with a statement and mark of proof: “&amp; the letter will
        turn as black as this one,” next to which he left an ink stroke on the
        page. As this mark bleeds through the paper, while the rest of the ink
        does not, I suggest that he has tested this recipe on this page of the
        manuscript (<i><u>Fig. 2</u></i>). Here, the text itself calls attention
        to the act of writing and making marks on paper as one of material as
        well as conceptual investigation. As we do not know the purpose of the
        manuscript—perhaps it was for publication, to give to a patron, or an
        aide-memoire of working practices—there is no reason why the act of
        writing this collection of observations and recipes cannot also be
        considered an experimental act in itself. It may be that the
        author-practitioner did not have a clear outcome for his text in mind,
        and we should regard his act of writing the manuscript as a form of
        practical experimentation as well as a means of recording information.

                have bled through to the reverse of the page. The bleedthrough,
                which is unusually clear, suggests that this line was made with
                a different kind of ink to that ordinarily used by the
                author-practitioner. Source: gallica.bnf.fr.</figcaption>

        Daily Interactions in the Workshop and the Home: Lighting, Food and
        Drink, Weather, Women</h2>
    <p>Despite a concerted effort, still very little about the identity of the
        author-practitioner has been discovered through the Making and Knowing
        Project<em>.</em> Obviously experienced in metalworking and mold making,
        knowledgeable about artillery and weaponry, and versed in a diverse
        range of craft practices, he was clearly an experienced craftsman with
        hands-on knowledge of at least some of the many processes about which he
        wrote. Writing in the first person about the process of whitening
        cornaline (which he spells backwards as it is a “secret”), he mentions
        that he experimented in “my goldsmith’s forge” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/12v/f/12v/tl"><u>12v</u></a>).
        However, we cannot say for sure if he was a member of a guild, which
        would have provided him with a defined professional identity and enabled
        us to speculate about his craft training and economic status. His
        familiarity with many German techniques and descriptions of their visual
        effect suggests that he might have traveled there, perhaps as a
        journeyman.<a href="#fn6"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref6"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> He twice recommends having “your
        boy” help with managing the fire in the workshop (“have the fire managed
        by a shop boy;” “make your boy blow on it”), suggesting that he worked
        with apprentices or day laborers in a workshop setting (fols. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/123v/f/123v/tl"><u>123v</u></a>
        and <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/135v/f/135v/tl"><u>135v</u></a>).
        He also mentions “the one who taught me to mold” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/110r/f/110r/tl"><u>110r</u></a>),
        but does not refer to him as a master, which might have confirmed an
        official apprenticeship. What the precise meaning of two entries,
        entitled “For the workshop” (“<em>Pour la boutique</em>,” fols. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/162r/f/162r/tl"><u>162r</u></a>
        and <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/166r/f/166r/tl"><u>166r</u></a>),
        might be is still under debate. Perhaps <em>La boutique</em> was the
        intended title of the finished manuscript, and these two entries with
        their references to classical texts and proverbs were intended to form
        the prefatory material. Whether or not this is the reason for these two
        headings, clearly the workshop was of conceptual importance, not just a
        physical space, connected in his mind with discovery and invention.</p>
    <p>Nevertheless, the workshop was also a real place, populated with tools,
        materials, and people. We get glimpses of the material realities of this
        space through some of the assumptions the author-practitioner makes.<a
           href="#fn7"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref7"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> For example, under the heading
        “Painter,” the reader is instructed to “clean your workshop well” before
        grinding colors, “for when walking, if you stir up dust, this will
        damage your colors”&nbsp;(fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/56v/f/56v/tl"><u>56v</u></a>).
        Lighting the workshop was also an issue, and candles are clearly of
        concern to the author-practitioner. He seems to have experience in
        making them, and of trying to improve their quality. On fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/16v/f/16v/tl"><u>16v</u></a>,
        he suggests:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>They keep well in bran which makes them white &amp; long-lasting, so
            say some. I believe, however, that it is enough to keep them in a
            cool &amp; dry place, in such manner that they are not pressed
            together. It is better if there is a hemp thread throughout the
            wick, which gives it more light &amp; makes the wick hold up
            straighter. Otherwise, if it is all of cotton, as those of Montauban
            make, it is necessary to snuff it out often, for after it has burnt
            <em>
                <del>il</del>
            </em> a little, the cotton droops &amp; makes the candle drip.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>A dripping candle was of such
        concern—probably because it could damage the careful work of the
        craftsperson and also wasted precious wax—that the author-practitioner
        even provides advice “For keeping candles from dripping and making them
        white,” suggesting to dip them into water beaten with bran (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/37v/f/37v/tl"><u>37r</u></a>).
        Candles were not only used for light, but could be useful tools at hand
        in the workshop, used to burn spiders’ “hairy feet” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/129v/f/129v/tl"><u>129v</u></a>),
        attract passerines (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/160v/f/160v/tl"><u>160v</u></a>),
        or to smoke a mold in preparation for casting (fols. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/82v/f/82v/tl"><u>82v</u></a>,
        <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/158v/f/158v/tl"><u>158v</u></a>).
        They could also be luxury goods, adding to the sensory ambience of a
        space, as we are reminded in an entry about a “Scented candle from Le
        Mans” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/166v/f/166v/tl"><u>166v</u></a>).&nbsp;Candles
        are also used at home, to “read and write,” even at some distance, with
        the use of a concave mirror (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/5v/f/5v/tl"><u>5v</u></a>).&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>While this text is clearly not intended to help with household
        management, the space and materials of the home and the workshop often
        intersect, showing how domestic and working life overlapped and posing
        the question as to whether the author-practitioner lived and worked in
        the same space.<a href="#fn8"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref8"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> He catches passerine birds by
        luring them into his house (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/160v/f/160v/tl"><u>160v</u></a>).
        He suggests that to dry preserves, one should use a chafing dish and a
        “bedsheet folded double” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/54v/f/54v/tl"><u>54v</u></a>).
        The skillets “where one makes the mush for little children” are useful
        for casting (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/136v/f/136v/tl"><u>136v</u></a>).&nbsp;He
        even suggests using house tiles to mix with sand for molding (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/106v/f/106v/tl"><u>106v</u></a>).
        While some processes required highly specialized and sizeable equipment,
        many could be easily achieved in a domestic kitchen or living space with
        tools at hand. When he advises that chestnuts should be kept in a “humid
        place,” he suggests the roof gutter (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/166v/f/166v/tl"><u>166v</u></a>),
        and he claims that oranges can be kept in a closed “tin vessel” for up
        to six months (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/16v/f/16v/tl"><u>16v</u></a>).
        Fir boxes, “like those where one puts sweetmeats,” are suitable for
        keeping silkworms (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/53v/f/53v/tl"><u>53v</u></a>).
        We get a hint of the implications of making at home when he mentions
        that mortars of fine copper are good “for a private home” because “they
        do not ring so much &amp; do not carry as much noise” as the ones for
        the apothecaries (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/85v/f/85v/tl"><u>85v</u></a>).
        While professionals like apothecaries could use the sound made by their
        tools as a form of auditory promotion for their trade, men and women
        working at home perhaps tried not to disturb their neighbors.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>While the manuscript only contains a small number of recipes for food
        (see, for example “Making <em>millas</em>” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/20r/f/20r/tl"><u>20r</u></a>)
        or “Excellent mustard” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/48r/f/48r/tl"><u>48r</u></a>)),
        workshop practice intersects with food and drink on several occasions.
        The author-practitioner describes how to taxidermy animals by drying
        them in the oven, “after the bread has been taken out,” suggesting that
        food preparation took place alongside craft practices (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/129v/f/129v/tl"><u>129v</u></a>).
        He also uses bread as a molding material (fols. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/140v/f/140v/tl"><u>140v</u></a>
        and <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/156r/f/156r/tl"><u>156r</u></a>)
        and as an ingredient in making black varnish (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/4v/f/4v/tl"><u>4v</u></a>).<a
           href="#fn9"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref9"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> Food might also mitigate the
        inherent dangers of working with toxic material. To avoid suffering from
        inhaling toxic fumes when making silver run, the author-practitioner
        advises to “take in the morning good buttered toast, and hold the said
        butter, or zedoary, or gold coins, in your mouth, and cover your face
        with a cloth from the eyes down” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/123v/f/123v/tl"><u>123v</u></a>).
        He describes a mixture made from vinegar mixed with rue and juniper
        berries to extinguish burning bricks which can also be used to cleanse
        “corrupt air” or to “remove infection” from a garment, room, or house
        (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/170v/f/170v/tl"><u>170v</u></a>).
    </p>
    <p>The local environment could be a generative source of materials, and the
        author-practitioner advises that artisans can increase their profit by
        “seeking things already prepared in nature” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/90r/f/90r/tl"><u>90r</u></a>).
        But while natural materials and the heat of the sun were helpful for
        making objects, the weather could pose a great challenge for
        craftspeople. He warns that painted panels repaired with glue can rot in
        damp weather, and wax will melt in the sun (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/59v/f/59v/tl"><u>59v</u></a>).
        When reheating molds in a forge, you must “[m]ake sure the wind from a
        window does not beat upon it” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/132v/f/132v/tl"><u>132</u></a>).
        We hear how windows can be made opaque if shade is required by rubbing
        them with calcined saltpeter (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/100r/f/100r/tl"><u>100r</u></a>).&nbsp;Rainy
        or damp conditions in particular posed problems. Crucibles made in
        winter or humid weather are deemed “not good” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/47v/f/47v/tl"><u>47v</u></a>),
        painters are warned to avoid working when it is “overcast” because it
        makes flesh colors too brown (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/31v/f/31v/tl"><u>31v</u></a>),
        and gold color can turn black in “damp &amp; humid” conditions (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/100r/f/100r/tl"><u>100r</u></a>).
        It was imperative that the craftsperson respond to the specific
        opportunities and challenges of their environment. When discussing “The
        work done in Algiers,” the author-practitioner explains that you should
        cut and feed barley and straw to the horse “in the manner one feeds
        horses in Spain.” However, he adds a suggestion that perhaps “it would
        be good” to also give the horse sulfurous baths and feed it fenugreek or
        “other hot foods” because the “intention of the worker” is to use the
        heat of a horse’s dung which might compensate for the fact that “the
        climate here is cooler than that of Algiers” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/52r/f/52r/tl"><u>52r</u></a>).
        Such a claim demonstrates how in order to successfully employ craft
        techniques from other locales, the skilled craftsman must be familiar
        with both his own surroundings and those from which the technique
        originated as well as understand not just what to do but what the
        intention of each step is, in order to adapt it to fit his local
        conditions. The large numbers of entries concerned with seasonality and
        animal husbandry are understandable, given that the success or failure
        of craft practices relied on a practical knowledge of how to exploit and
        mitigate the challenges of the local environment.</p>
    <p>Women are largely absent from the world conjured up by Ms. Fr. 640. The
        author-practitioner offers advice about the best pigments to use when
        painting the shadows of women (fols. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/65r/f/65r/tl"><u>65r</u></a>–<a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/66r/f/66r/tl"><u>66r</u></a>)
        and mentions that concave mirrors can be used by women to “see the
        secret places that they do not want to show surgeons” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/5v/f/5v/tl"><u>5v</u></a>).
        He also tells us that “ladies, wanting to color their cheeks, grind
        Florence lake very finely, then fill a little cotton with it, which they
        next wrap in a little fabric of Cambray which is clear. And thus they
        pounce the lake on their cheeks &amp; then, with another clean cotton,
        they soften it.” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/58r/f/58r/tl"><u>58r</u></a>).&nbsp;We
        get glimpses of their working lives when he mentions that starch water
        is made by women (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/113v/f/113v/tl"><u>113v</u></a>),
        and he notes that women in Flanders do gilding work, suggesting that
        this was not common practice in Toulouse (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/66r/f/66r/tl"><u>66r</u></a>).
        Women’s milk is also said to be better for making crayons (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/57v/f/57v/tl"><u>57v</u></a>).
        We are also told, without further explanation, that if a sheep shearer
        should want to castrate his sheep, “he must not have been with his wife
        for this would make the sheep die” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/41v/f/41v/tl"><u>41v</u></a>).
    </p>
    <h2 id="proverbs-and-sayings">Proverbs and Sayings</h2>
    <p>Such a claim suggests a certain kind of proverbial wisdom, even if the
        reasoning is not explained. Natalie Zemon-Davis has written about the
        importance of local proverbs in recording the culture and mentalities of
        early modern France.<a href="#fn10"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref10"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> As Piero Camporesi explains,
        “the proverb consolidates the unattributed wisdom of a group,”<a
           href="#fn11"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref11"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> but the collecting of proverbs
        from peasants was also a most appropriate activity amongst learned men
        in early modern Europe, and it may be that the author-practitioner
        collected proverbs both for their practical information and as a means
        to record local sayings and interesting information for an elite
        reader.<a href="#fn12"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref12"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> For example, he records under
        the title “Observation from rustics,” that “when it freezes on Palm
        Sunday, it freezes all the months of the year” and “when the first
        flowers fall &amp; are lost from the frost, the others are usually lost
        also” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/93r/f/93r/tl"><u>93r</u></a>).
        Such advice both informs an elite reader about the wisdom of a “rustic,”
        offering a form of armchair travel or access to an otherwise unfamiliar
        social stratum, but it can also potentially offer useful information
        about predicting the weather and harvests ahead. Similarly useful
        cultivation wisdom is offered for planting trees: “One says that rarely
        a tree planted on Saint Paul’s day fails to take” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/38v/f/38v/tl"><u>38v</u></a>).
        On the other hand, the author-practitioner dismisses the beliefs of
        founders who think only “three days a week are good for melting, namely
        Tuesdays, <del>Wednesdays</del> Thursdays, and Saturdays. The others,
        for them, are unlucky,” as no more than “superstition” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/87r/f/87r/tl"><u>87r</u></a>).
        Proverbs are also used as evidence supporting his claims, such as for
        taking care of fluxes in the ear, when he reminds the reader “to be very
        careful not to put anything inside,” specifically referencing “the
        proverb, one ought only to touch the ear &amp; the eye with the elbow”
        (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/15v/f/15v/tl"><u>15v</u></a>).
    </p>
    <p>Other statements record information about practices from further afield.
        The author-practitioner writes that there are no spiders in Ireland, as
        the local wood makes them die. Due to this, he suggests, rich people in
        England make their ceilings of Irish wood to avoid cobwebs (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/71v/f/71v/tl"><u>71v</u></a>).
        This information could be of use to an enterprising craftsperson with a
        clear interest both in making things from wood and also catching spiders
        for casting, who might seek to investigate what kinds of wood repel
        spiders. While it is not clear how the author-practitioner came upon
        this information, this belief was still circulating in 1646 and
        widespread enough for Thomas Browne to challenge it in his “Enquiries
        into Vulgar and Common Errors:” “most men affirme, and few here will
        believe the contrary, that there be no Spiders in Ireland but wee have
        beheld some in that Country, and though but few, some cobwebs we behold
        in Irish wood in England.”<a href="#fn13"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref13"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> On the same page as his claim
        about Irish wood, the author-practitioner also notes that the Irish do
        not drink wine but convert it into eau-de-vie, “which they use almost as
        habitually as we use wine” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/71v/f/71v/tl"><u>71v</u></a>).
        Such a statement gives us insight both into the local practices of wine
        drinking and an acknowledgement of cultural difference.</p>
    <p>Certain proverbs and advice give us more specific insights into
        Toulousain beliefs and practices. For example, he mentions that
        “candlemakers never make a good candle when the Autan wind blows,”
        referencing the strong south-westerly wind still said to make people go
        mad.<a href="#fn14"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref14"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> He also sees fit to record and
        challenge or amend local claims. Under the title “Common saying,” he
        writes, “bell tower of Rodez, church of Albi, bells of Mende. However,
        one holds the [bell] of Toulouse named Cardaillac as one of the most
        beautiful in France, all the more since it weighs two hundred and fifty
        quintals” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/20v/f/20v/tl"><u>20v</u></a>).
        This list of local architectural masterpieces presumably marks them out
        because of their exceptional sizes and manufacture. At 87 meters, the
        pink sandstone bell tower at Rodez, added in the early sixteenth
        century, is still the highest in France. The church of Albi he refers to
        is presumably the Cathedral of Sainte Cécile, built between 1282 and
        1480, supposedly the largest brick building in the world. The bells of
        Mende might refer to the “Non Pareille” bell, added to the cathedral in
        1517, which was the largest bell in the world, and so loud it could be
        heard from around 16 kilometers away before it was destroyed in 1579 by
        the Huguenots. To this list, the author-practitioner writes that he
        wants to add the great Cardaillac bell in the Cathedral of Saint-Étienne
        in Toulouse, citing its weight as well as its beauty. As someone
        interested in casting, founders who make bells (fols. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/15r/f/15r/tl"><u>15r</u></a>,
        <a

        <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/142v/f/142v/tl"><u>142v</u></a>),
        and the sound of bells (suggesting to cast with more copper “to give it
        a bigger voice” or tin for a “clearer sound” [fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/24r/f/24r/tl"><u>24r</u></a>]),
        it is not surprising that the author-practitioner is impressed by the
        weight of the bell in his local cathedral.</p>
    <h2 id="religion">Religion</h2>
    <p>Bells provided an aural identity for Catholics, audibly setting them
        apart from Protestants who tended to worship with song, and so the
        author-practitioner’s fond mention of bells as beautiful, loud, and
        clear suggests that he was a Catholic.<a href="#fn15"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref15"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> However, apart from the
        extensive discussions about weaponry and warfare tactics, we get no hint
        that Toulouse was in the midst of often bitter religious fighting and
        wars between Catholics and Protestants from the 1560s onwards.<a
           href="#fn16"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref16"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> Nevertheless, religious comments
        pepper the manuscript. God is only directly invoked once, in a recipe
        for making water to heal eye disease, which is said to work “with the
        help of God” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/79r/f/79r/tl"><u>79r</u></a>).
        Another medical recipe also suggests that spiritual efficacy is required
        to heal burns. The author-practitioner suggests that you should stir wax
        and linseed oil together over the fire “for as long as it takes you to
        say <del>one</del> 9 paternoster, and as you say them, wash this
        composition with holy water, stirring all the while.” Then, the process
        is repeated with 8, 7, 6 paternosters (and so on), until the mixture
        turns white, which will prove to be an “excellent” remedy (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/103r/f/103r/tl"><u>103r</u></a>).
        As Xiaomeng Liu has argued, this process employs a spiritual power in
        its material transformation.<a href="#fn17"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref17"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
    <p>In a unique example, the author-practitioner explicitly makes clear his
        specific understanding of religious teachings, which informs his
        investigations into snakes for molding. In describing their movements,
        he notes, “I have noticed that when they want to bite or eat something,
        they do not bite with a direct attack, but with sinuous turns &amp; from
        the side, as do Satan &amp; his disciples” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/109r/f/109r/tl"><u>109r</u></a>–<a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/109v/f/109v/tl"><u>109v</u></a>).
        He also explains snake physiognomy (that they have a “small head, but a
        very long body”) as a manifestation of the dangers of evil: “the
        entryway to sin seems small &amp; inconsequential, but the consequences
        of it are very great” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/109v/f/109v/tl"><u>109v</u></a>).
        These brief statements give a rare insight into the ways that an early
        modern experimenter might combine his investigations of the natural
        world with his religious beliefs.</p>
    <p>The author practitioner also made religious objects. He explains that he
        has “experimented with sand from Thoulouse” and “with wine boiled with
        elm root, and molded with it a large piece of a portrait of Jesus” (fol.
        <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/85v/f/85v/tl"><u>85v</u></a>).
        He also tells us how to mount Agnus Dei—wax discs imprinted with the
        image of a lamb and blessed by the Pope (<i><u>Fig. 3</u></i>)—on small
        boxes (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/15v/f/15v/tl"><u>15v</u></a>).
        We also learn about the environment of the church, hearing how older
        glass windows in churches were made thicker than “those of today” and in
        “more lively colors” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/38r/f/38r/tl"><u>38r</u></a>)
        and that “small works” of cast lead “are sold in front of churches,”
        likely referring to small pilgrim badges or ex-voto (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/49r/f/49r/tl"><u>49r</u></a>).<a

    <p>Religious objects provide a common point of reference with his intended
        reader and as such are useful for measurements. For example, he advises
        to take “two or three rosary beads’ worth of rocaille” to make blue
        paint for glass (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/31v/f/31v/tl"><u>31v</u></a>).
        He also suggests using paternoster beads of jet to make black varnish
        (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/4v/f/4v/tl"><u>4v</u></a>).
        Such a description might be a qualitative statement referring to the
        size of the rosary beads (as with the rocaille example), but
        paternosters made of jet were made in France at least since the 1260s,
        as when Étienne Boileau compiled his <em>Livre des métiers</em> he
        divided the trade of making paternosters into three, one of which
        specialized in making paternosters of amber and jet.<a href="#fn19"

        Perhaps the deep black of the material, combined with its spiritual
        efficacy, was thought to offer a depth of tone to black varnish, or
        maybe the material of the rosary held no enduring spiritual potency for
        the author-practitioner, who was happy to make practical use of
        materials, however holy, in the service of color making. In his recipe
        for making millas, he refers to an earthenware mold made in “the fashion
        of the crown of a Catholic hat,” potentially the rounded
        <em>Camauro</em> hat worn by the Pope (fol. <a

    <p>What did the author-practitioner look like? While we do not know, the
        manuscript contains two sketchy marginal drawings of faces on fols. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/61r/f/61r/tl"><u>61r</u></a>
        and <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/169v/f/169v/tl"><u>169v</u></a>,
        which are not explicitly referenced as self-portraits but may have been
        (<i><u>Fig. 5</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 6</u></i>). A couple of body parts are
        also illustrated. One image, showing a makeshift brace to hold “small
        work” needing repairs (such as the turtle cast from life shown in the
        illustration) depicts a seemingly naked leg, simply outlined although
        with a hint of musculature, and foot holding a rope around a cushion
        (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/152v/f/152v/tl"><u>152v</u></a>)
        (<i><u>Fig. 7</u></i>). Elsewhere I have posed the question about what
        the author-practitioner might have been wearing in his workshop, or as
        he sat writing up his experiments.<a href="#fn22"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref22"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a> In a charming illustration
        accompanying a trick to relight a candle, a depiction of hands lighting
        a “wicker,” we see a pair of hands decorated with ruffled cuffs, which
        would have been a fashionable way to edge one’s linen undershirt in the
        late sixteenth century (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/33r/f/33r/tl"><u>33r</u></a>)
        (<i><u>Fig. 8</u></i>). This is the only depicted dressed body part in
        the manuscript, but it reminds us that whatever overgarments he wore,
        the author-practitioner would have been wearing linen next to his skin.
        All men and women in the early modern period regardless of social status
        (excepting the very poorest who wore rags) would have worn a long linen
        shirt or smock under their clothing. This was a comfortable and cool
        layer, which absorbed dirt and sweat and was easy to wash, bleach, and
        starch (he mentions starch water made by women on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/113v/f/113v/tl"><u>113v</u></a>,
        probably for this purpose), unlike the wools and silks worn on outer
        garments.<a href="#fn23"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref23"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a> If a “garment” becomes stained,
        the author-practitioner recommends rubbing it with eau-de-vie (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/29v/f/29v/tl"><u>29v</u></a>).
        While ruffs and cuffs were fashionable and decorative, they were also
        practical, as they protected the more valuable sleeve from being dirtied
        while at work. The author-practitioner often mentions using linen cloths
        to clean materials in the workshop or as strainers to separate liquids
        from solids. In his instructions on “Sand from pulverized rock salt and
        sand from the mine finely ground on marble,” he even suggests passing
        the sand “through a double sieve or through the sleeve of a shirt,”
        confirming that he owned plain weave linen shirts and expected the same
        of his reader (fol. <a

    <p>The author-practitioner was familiar with textiles colored in deep or
        vibrant hues, as he mentions several recipes for dyeing and discusses
        black and crimson textiles. He seems to have spoken with textile or dye
        merchants, which is not surprising for a craftsman living in Toulouse,
        the center of the sixteenth-century woad trade.<a href="#fn24"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref24"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a> When he gives an example of what
        would be written in a merchant’s “waste book,” he uses the examples of
        two sales of cambric, a light linen named after its place of manufacture
        in Cambrai (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/9v/f/9v/tl"><u>9v</u></a>),
        and he notes that merchants who sell velvet or other stuffs do not use
        double-entry although those who sell woad do (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/38v/f/38v/tl"><u>38v</u></a>).
        He also writes at length about silkworm cultivation, a growing industry
        in early modern Europe that led to an increased market for silk goods
        (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/53v/f/53v/tl"><u>53v</u></a>).<a
           href="#fn25"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref25"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a> He mentions that pearls that
        have “been applied in embroidery on some garment” are likely to be
        “greasy” but can be cleaned with soapy water, suggesting that he was
        familiar with very finely decorated clothing (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/13v/f/13v/tl"><u>13v</u></a>).
        His instructions for pouncing designs onto satin with chalk or flour,
        and then tracing them with glair before scratching with glass or a
        penknife, demonstrates just how easy it was to decorate textiles with
        the fashionable small cuts known as “pinks” and “slashes” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/42v/f/42v/tl"><u>42v</u></a>).<a

           role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a> Whether or not he himself wore
        pinked silks, embroidered pearls, and velvet and cambric clothes dyed in
        crimson or black, the author-practitioner expected that his readers
        would be interested in the making of these kinds of fashions.</p>
    <p>Other items of clothing, particularly accessories, are mentioned in
        passing. Shoes are useful tools, mentioned as a handy way to stop a
        snake (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/110r/f/110r/tl"><u>110r</u></a>),
        though the author-practitioner notes that you should take your shoe off
        when you step on a cuttlefish bone mold lest it break (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/145v/f/145v/tl"><u>145v</u></a>).
        Perhaps he wore tanned and decorated black leather shoes, for he
        mentions that a shoemaker can “dip a writing quill in oil of sulfur and
        paint with it what he would like on shoes, boots, and colets.” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/46v/f/46v/tl"><u>46v</u></a>).
        He also suggests that those who lack boots can wrap their legs in rope
        made of hay, and “the rain will never pass through” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/54v/f/54v/tl"><u>54v</u></a>).
        He suggests that burnt hat felt is good for making sand molds (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/83r/f/83r/tl"><u>83r</u></a>).
        A small illustration accompanying instructions for a trick “For
        transmuting grain from one vessel to another” depicts a simple cloche
        hat that can be used as a cover (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/35v/f/35v/tl"><u>35v</u></a>)
        (<i><u>Fig. 9</u></i>). Such a shape was quite common in the late
        sixteenth century, easily made with felted wool or beaver fur, and worn
        by men and women across the social spectrum, as is seen in the depiction
        of a French “rustic” in Hans Weigel’s <em>Trachtenbuch</em> (1577) (<i><u>Fig. 10</u></i>).<a href="#fn27"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref27"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a> He also mentions that
        “villagers” in Toulouse wear “fine [...] straw” hats (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/32v/f/32v/tl"><u>32v</u></a>),
        an example of which might be seen in Weigel’s depiction of a “rustic
        woman” (<i><u>Fig. 11</u></i>). When describing at length the process of
        making leather scabbards (sword sheaths), he mentions that “common
        people” can buy them ready made, though this is inferior to getting a
        custom one, “for they are never carried as well.” A scabbard of “good
        cow” is “better than any and also costs more, except the velvet kind”
        which is the “best scabbard of all” if waxed (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/94r/f/94r/tl"><u>94r</u></a>).
        However, while a scabbard is valued here for its luxury materials, when
        he describes at length the material hierarchies of sword grips, other
        concerns eclipse social signaling through fine decoration. He lists a
        range of materials from which sword grips can be made, including silk,
        dogfish skin, iron wire, gold threads, “fine &amp; false silver,” or
        velvet. He first recommends iron wire, for it “has a lower price &amp;
        is the most durable. Next is the grip of silk, if one does not have the
        convenience of being close to the sea” to procure dogfish. Dogfish skin,
        made from a sand shark, is a “beautiful skin,” he says, and costs “fifty
        or lx sous &amp; 4 or five grips are made from it. This kind gives a
        good grip even if the hand is sweating” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/94r/f/94r/tl"><u>94r</u></a>).
        Such claims demonstrate how economic, practical, and logistical concerns
        are combined into a nuanced hierarchy of materials. While gold and
        velvet might be associated with elites, the practicality of a dogskin
        handle in a sweaty palm makes it superior.</p>

    <p>These examples show how important accessories, textiles, dyestuffs, and
        garments were to the early modern economy, and illustrate that men and
        women dressed for both practicality and style. The hierarchies of
        materials used in clothing and accessories signaled the expense and time
        invested by their owners to get the look and function right, as well as
        the ingenuity of the craftsmen who made them, who exploited the
        practical propensity of materials to last well or act as a waterproof
        layer while making their owner look good. These objects sustain social
        and cultural identity, they set “villagers” and “common people” apart
        from those who could afford fine things, but there is no simple binary
        between rich and poor. Rather, there are nuanced levels of material
        qualities, valued for both their luxurious beauty and ability to perform
        their job well.</p>
    <h2 id="the-material-world">The Material World</h2>
    <p>What else can we learn about material culture of the every day from this
        manuscript? We discover that people in Toulouse make finely woven mats
        “to hang on the partition walls of rooms,” dyed green, red, and violet
        (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/32v/f/32v/tl"><u>32v</u></a>).
        We learn that the “tiles with which one covers houses” are hard and
        firm, and can be used in making molds (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/106v/f/106v/tl"><u>106v</u></a>).
        The exteriors of houses can also be decorated with stamped metal plaques
        painted with gold leaf that will “hold up in the rain” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/7r/f/7r/tl"><u>7r</u></a>).
        These stamps might also be glued onto smaller items like trunks,
        mirrors, valances, and bedposts, on top of “colored velvet or satin”
        (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/7r/f/7r/tl"><u>7r</u></a>).
        Such decorations are different from those found on houses in Germany,
        which the author-practitioner explains are cast medals made with a
        reheated plaster mix that also “do not fear the rain” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/125r/f/125r/tl"><u>125r</u></a>).
    </p>
    <p>The interiors of homes can also be “ornament[ed] with little expense”
        through the use of stucco made of tragacanth gum and rye flour formed
        into whatever shape you like (he suggests “masks and garlands”) and can
        be painted or gilded, a technique said to be used for ceiling ornaments
        in Rome.<a href="#fn28"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref28"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a> He suggests making bed ornaments
        with the rye-flour stucco (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/29r/f/29r/tl"><u>29r</u></a>).
        Decorating beds seems to be a preoccupation for the author-practitioner,
        who mentions on several occasions casting mixed tin ornaments and
        decorating them with gold leaf, small rubies, orpiment, and colored
        grains for “adorning beds, mirrors, and suchlike” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/131r/f/131r/tl"><u>131r</u></a>)
        and “the edges of mirrors, the tops of chests, or the friezes of bed
        valances” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/6v/f/6v/tl"><u>6v</u></a>).
        Counterfeit jasper, made of horn, pigments, and wool, can also be used
        as an inlay to “encrust beds with” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/10r/f/10r/tl"><u>10r</u></a>).
        We find out about writing tablets made of boxwood inlaid with ebony,
        sandalwood, ivory, or gold and silver for writing on with silverpoint
        and erasing with a cuttlefish bone (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/15v/f/15v/tl"><u>15v</u></a>).
        The author-practitioner is interested in decorating boxes with softened
        horn (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/15v/f/15v/tl"><u>15v</u></a>),
        and he notes that the Germans make boxes covered with painted and
        varnished paper (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/67r/f/67r/tl"><u>67r</u></a>).
        We are told about the process by which sheath makers imprint “some
        history” or can even imitate statues and delicate medals on leather,
        perhaps explaining the process by which molded leather étuis have been
        formed (<i><u>Fig. 12</u></i>) (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/57v/f/57v/tl"><u>57v</u></a>).
        He offers instructions for a cheap way of making imitation damask or
        embroidery by resist dyeing (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/15r/f/15r/tl"><u>15r</u></a>),
        explains how one can back gemstones with gold (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/37r/f/37r/tl"><u>37r</u></a>),
        and describes the process by which “common people” can make emeralds
        from pebbles, vinegar, copper, minium, <em>sel de verre,</em> and
        sandiver bought from glassmakers or apothecaries (fol. <a

    <p>In Ms. Fr. 640, we see how someone who could not afford silver or gold
        ornaments might still mimic their luminosity or even decorate their
        homes with fairly successful imitations of jasper inlay. We also learn
        about quotidian material culture, presumably familiar to the
        author-practitioner’s contemporaries, such as “an earthenware bowl, from
        which the peasants eat their soup” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/121v/f/121v/tl"><u>121v</u></a>).
        We discover that kitchen pots are made “with the same metal the bells
        are made of” to avoid giving meat a bad taste, and that latten is added
        to make them more yellow “in order to sell them better” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/36v/f/36v/tl"><u>36v</u></a>),
        showing how makers had to entice both the eyes and the tongue with their
        wares. The author-practitioner also describes how sieves made of
        horsetails are woven in Coutances, Normandy, and are brought to Spain
        via Toulouse, where they are traded for silk tammy (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/44v/f/44v/tl"><u>44v</u></a>).
        Such details offer a uniquely rich image of the decorative arts and
        material culture made and owned by the artisan classes of early modern
        Toulouse.</p>
    <p>While fine luxury items from the region survive in collections in France
        and around the world, demonstrating that Toulouse was populated by
        highly skilled craftspeople and discerning wealthy patrons who collected
        objects of glass, gold, silk, wood, and marble that represent some of
        the finest Renaissance decorative arts, the material culture made for
        and used by the non-elites has hardly survived.<a href="#fn31"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref31"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a> As Daniel Roche has observed,
        “we are better informed about the King’s furniture than about that of
        the peasantry.”<a href="#fn32"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref32"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a> The reconstructions of many of
        these objects in the Making and Knowing Laboratory, as well as by
        collaborators of the project, has already recreated material otherwise
        unknown, ephemeral, or underrepresented objects.<a href="#fn33"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref33"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a> Still more are likely to be
        created by readers of the online edition. The manuscript therefore
        evokes a culturally, economically, and materially nuanced picture of
        daily life and material culture of Toulouse specifically, and Europe
        more generally, and enables twenty-first-century researchers and makers
        to bring these processes and objects to life once more.</p>
    <p>How-to texts like Ms Fr. 640 are often mined by historians for what they
        can reveal about the intellectual life of their authors, but this essay
        has aimed to show that we can also learn much about daily life and the
        making, use, trade, and cultural meaning of material culture through
        these kinds of sources. That the author-practitioner chose to collect
        and record information about domestic interiors and proverbs alongside
        his observations and instructions for weaponry use, mold making, and
        metal casting, suggests that he considered this information to be
        notable and useful to his reader. His understanding of the material
        world was informed by his quotidian experiences, and in texts like this
        we see how material, intellectual, religious, and experimental life was
        inseparable from the mundane. He integrated these aspects of daily life
        and material culture in early modern Europe into his understanding of
        the material world, and they informed his craft knowledge. In other
        words, instructional texts enable us to see how material culture and
        everyday life informed artisanal epistemology. More close readings of
        how-to texts might offer us a far richer picture of the economic,
        religious, social, cultural, and material surroundings of early modern
        men and women.</p>
