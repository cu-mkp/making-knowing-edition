        <div>
            <p>“To Shrink an Object” examines the process on fol. <a

                for varying the shape or size of an impression in a mold made
                from bread, which is subsequently cast with sulfur. It situates
                this bread molding recipe in its historical context—of bread
                molding methods as well as uses of bread and bread making in
                craft and artistic practices—in the period of the manuscript’s
                compilation. The reconstruction tests the viability of this
                process, specifically, the entry’s instructions to dry the bread
                in order to reduce the size of an impression in a bread mold,
                and thus of the subsequently cast object, in relation to the
                original pattern used to make the imprint. Reconstruction shows
                that the types of bread used, along with the preparation of the
                bread pith, influence the extent of the shrinkage. Reheating a
                bread mold also hastened the shrinking process that occurred
                when imprints were left to dry naturally. The longer the molds
                were reheated, the more the impressions decreased in size.</p>

        in Ms. Fr. 640 contains a recipe, “For casting in sulfur,” which
        instructs the reader to use bread pith (<em>mie de pain</em>) as a mold
        for sulfur-casting. This process is expanded on in the subsequent entry,
        “Molding and shrinking a large figure,” located on the same page. Here,
        the author-practitioner notes how varying casts can be produced from a
        single object by “elongating” (<em>allongeant</em>) or “shrinking”
        (<em>apetisser</em>) the bread pith. This is an unusual set of
        instructions. While bread and bread making feature in a range of craft
        and artistic recipes, bread molding seems to be almost unique in the
        written record, found only in one nineteenth-century publication in
        French, <em>Nouveau Manuel</em>.<a href="#fn1"

        provide no information about the purpose of casting objects in varying

    <p>This essay examines the existence of bread molding in its historical
        context. It situates fol. 140v alongside bread molding techniques, other
        uses of bread and bread making in object casting, and broader craft
        practices in early modern Europe. The essay then tests the viability of
        drying bread molds to change the shape and size of the mold and thereby
        the resultant cast, focusing specifically on the “shrinking” of the
        bread pith in the entry “Molding and shrinking a large figure” on fol.
        140v. Through reconstruction, this essay confirms it is possible to use
        bread molds to take imprints from objects and cast those imprints—both
        in their original and resized form. Reheating the bread molds also
        increases and speeds up the shrinking of the imprints. The types and
        quantities of ingredients used in making the bread, and kneading the
        bread pith after extracting it from its baked loaf, also affect the
        clarity of the impressions made.</p>
    <h2 id="historical-context">Historical Context </h2>
    <p>Bread was a primary staple in early modern Europe.<a href="#fn3"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref3"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> Considering its ubiquity,
        surprisingly few recipes for bread exist. Cookbooks and craft manuals
        nonetheless reveal some of the varieties of bread consumed during the
        period and how they were produced.<a href="#fn4"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref4"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> The types of bread available
        differed in their ingredients, baking methods, and origin.<a href="#fn5"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref5"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> The English writer John Evelyn
        (1620–1706) for instance, noted several types of “French bread”
        contemporaneous to the period, from “House-hold Bread” produced in the
        domestic space to the “best Bread of France,” the “Pain de Gonnesse.”<a
           href="#fn6"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref6"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> Sold commercially by professional
        bakers and also made in the household, bread was a quotidian material
        readily at hand; it is perhaps unsurprising that it was employed in
        various craft processes, and its properties were often used to make
        conceptual or qualitative comparisons.</p>
    <p>Apart from serving as a source of food, bread was used as an ingredient
        in a range of recipes within craft and artistic manuals, ranging from
        simple uses such as for erasing marks of different kinds, to more
        complicated uses, such as that detailed in the 1685 English edition of
        <em>Polygraphice</em> (originally published in 1673), in which medical
        practitioner William Salmon utilized baked bread loaves “To make
        artificial flesh.”<a href="#fn7"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref7"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> In this recipe, Salmon instructs
        his readers to insert freshly baked wheat loaves into a “bolthead of
        glass,” before setting it in a temperature bath for two months, so as to
        produce “fibrous flesh.”<a href="#fn8"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref8"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> Similarly, in Hugh Plat’s <em>The
            Jewell House of Art and Nature,</em> first published in 1594, the
        English barrister and compiler of artisanal recipes, includes
        instructions for molding <em>with</em> bread (in contrast to Ms. Fr.
        640’s process for molding <em>in</em> bread): “some will mold great, and
        curious patterns in the crum of fine manchet well tempered into past[e],
        and pressed hard upon the pattern.” Here, “manchet” refers to a fine
        wheat bread, which is formed into a paste and used to create relief
        designs.<a href="#fn9"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref9"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> Extending the use of bread beyond
        the physical space of a craftsman's workshop, Plat also notes how
        “crustes of bread” in “broken beere, or flatten milk” could be used to
        fatten capons “in a more cheap manner.”<a href="#fn10"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref10"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> The use of bread as a craft
        material persevered long after the sixteenth century; its constituent
        ingredients, such as flour and yeast, would be included in casting
        recipes of English engineer N.E. Spretson, published in 1892.<a

    <p>Bread not only featured as a physical material within craft and artistic
        processes, but was used as a tool to manufacture products. For instance,
        in the recipe “Of making artificial pearls” in <em>Polygraphice</em>,
        Salmon instructs his readers to place the pearls, made of a mixture of
        mother of pearl, oil of sulfur, and egg whites, “into a loaf of bread”
        and bake it “till the loaf is much burnt.”<a href="#fn12"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref12"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> After extracting these “pearls”
        from the loaves and washing them one was left with artificial pearls “as
        fair as the truly natural.”<a href="#fn13"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref13"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> Plat also uses bread as a tool,
        exploiting its absorptive quality in his recipe for purifying sallet
        [salad] oil.<a href="#fn14"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref14"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> By placing a “piece of bread or
        [...] dough” into heated salad oil, Plat claims that the bread will
        “draw into it selfe all the must[y] and bad taste or s[c]ent” of the
        oil, thus keeping it “pure and cleane.”<a href="#fn15"

           role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
    <p>As Emma le Pouésard has argued, the ubiquity of bread in early modern
        Europe allowed for bread and the bread-making process to function as
        material mediators in craft recipes, helping artisans to clarify
        unfamiliar technical processes.<a href="#fn16"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref16"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> Bread was thus used both
        physically and metaphorically in craft and artistic practices. For
        instance, Plat’s recipe “how to dry rose leaves…” uses the timing of
        when bread is “drawn [...] out of the oven” to describe the appropriate
        moment to place the cake of rose leaves in the oven to dry.<a
           href="#fn17"

           id="fnref17"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> Similarly, in Benvenuto
        Cellini’s (1500–1571) treatise on goldsmithing and sculpture, he
        instructs mixing clay and cloth frayings “to the consistency of a
        dough,” before giving them a “good baking” to produce cores for
        bronze-casting.<a href="#fn18"

    <p>Beyond Ms. Fr. 640, only one other instance of casting objects in bread
        molds has been found, in <em>Nouveau Manuel</em>, first published in
        1828 by M. Lebrun.<a href="#fn19"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref19"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a> While little is known about the
        author apart from his membership in “numerous academies,” six editions
        of this work were published until the year 1917, suggesting sustained
        interest.<a href="#fn20"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref20"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> In its 1838 and 1850 editions,
        bread molding is featured in Chapter X, “Method for molding medals and
        brooches,” specifically in the recipe “Bread pith molding:”</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Take bread pith while still hot and baked only a little, knead this
            dough with a rolling pin, add a little bit of aloe so that it does
            not stick to the glass. Once this preparation is done, take this
            dough of bread pith and use it to stamp the medal. Use as much care
            to push it into the cavities as possible. Let dry, turn over the
            brooch, detach the concave part, and use it to pour the sulfur, the
            plaster, the talc, the chalk, the wax, but not to stamp again, be it
            with mastic, the bread pith dough, etc.: you risk obtaining
            unrecognizable shapes. In general, before molding, examine the
            brooch or the medal well: if there are a lot of cavities, you can be
            sure that the stamping probably will not succeed; only bread pith,
            and especially gelatin, will give you a somewhat satisfying
            result.<a href="#fn21"

        publication, three authors, M. F. -B. Robert, M.Magnier, and M.
        Valicourt, expanded on and reworked different sections of the
        <em>Nouveau Manuel</em>, including the bread molding entry; the 1843
        edition provides additional steps to take before imprinting the bread:<a

            One manipulates it well, then works it with a rolling pin until it

            longer sticks to the rolling pin, has become elastic, and can be
            worked with the fingers without it sticking. This manipulation is
            necessary for this kind of dough so that it shrinks as little as

    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>Given that Lebrun’s <em>Nouveau
            Manuel</em> was published about two centuries after Ms. Fr. 640 was
        written, it is not clear if bread molding was commonly practiced in
        early modern France. Perhaps, like bread baking, bread molding was such
        a common practice for making test pieces, as a kind of ephemeral
        intermediate step in larger craft processes, that craftspeople simply
        passed on the technique by experience rather than by writing it down,
        and thus neither written nor material evidence survives for the
        practice. Whether there were continuities or developments in this
        casting technique over time is also difficult to tell given the limited
        sources<em>.</em> Nonetheless, Lebrun’s use of bread for molds indicates
        that the author-practitioner’s practice was not unique.</p>
    <p>Lebrun’s method of bread molding, in its various editions, also shares
        several similarities with the entries on sulfur casting in fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/140v/f/140v/tl"><u>140v</u></a>
        in Ms. Fr. 640 (see Appendix). First, the insides of the bread used are
        “still hot” (<em>chaude</em>), thus fresh from the oven. Second, an
        imprint is made by pushing the object into the bread pith. Third, one
        should “let dry” (<em>laisser sécher</em>) this impression, before
        materials—such as sulfur—can be cast into it. Lebrun’s instructions also
        include additional steps: separating the bread pith (<em>mie de
            pain</em>) from crust, adding aloe, and kneading the pith into
        paste. Further, it details potential pitfalls to avoid to ensure the
        bread mold’s success, namely, the choice of object for casting (avoid a
        brooch with too many cavities), as well as the imprinting technique
        (pushing into the cavities). In the <em>Nouveau Manuel’s</em> 1843
        edition, instructions for bread molding also emphasize oiling the
        imprint before casting, and placing weights on the object as it dries
        within the bread mold to increase the pressure and thus the depth of the
        impression made. It also explains the kneading of the bread pith as a
        method of preventing the mold from shrinking, contrary to the
        author-practitioner’s aims in fol. 140v.</p>
    <p>To what extent, then, can Lebrun’s recipe, in its various editions,
        supplement our understanding of the entries on fol. 140v? In other
        words, did the author-practitioner simply leave out such intermediary
        steps and notes of precaution in his instructions, or is Lebrun’s method
        for bread molding a separate technique? Must the bread pith be separated
        and further manipulated after baking to produce an imprint for casting,
        or was this only necessary if the goal was for the mold to shrink “as
        little as possible?” My reconstruction of Lebrun’s method of further
        manipulating the bread pith to prevent the shrinking of its imprints was
        inconclusive. However, his kneading process, the instructions to dry out
        the bread mold before removing the impressed object, and the suggestion
        to oil the mold before casting, are beneficial in producing imprints,
        and consequently casts, that capture more of the original object’s
        details.</p>
    <h2 id="bread-molding-in-ms.-fr.-640">Bread molding in Ms. Fr. 640 </h2>
    <p>In Ms. Fr. 640, entries on bread molding emphasize the speed and clarity
        of imprinting on bread pith.<a href="#fn24"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref24"

           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/140v/f/140v/tl"><u>140v</u></a>
        also notes the possibility of further manipulating the impression in the
        bread pith:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Mold it with bread pith, having come from the oven, or, as the
            aforesaid, &amp; in drying out it will shrink &amp; consequently the
            medal that you will cast. You can, by this means, by elongating and
            widening the imprinted bread pith, vary the figure &amp; with one
            image make many various ones. Bread coming from the oven is better.
            And the one that is reheated twice retracts more. You can cast
            sulfur without leaving the imprint of the bread to dry, if you want
            to mold as big as it is. But if you want to let it shrink, make it
            dry, either more or less.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>This technique and process of manipulating
        the bread pith to change the size and shape of the cast object are
        absent from Lebrun’s bread molding process and so are unique to the
        manuscript. Here, the author-practitioner exploits the tendency bread
        has to shrink when drying, which causes a correlative shrinking in any
        impression made in bread. He also uses the plastic nature of the bread
        to “elongat[e] and widen” the imprint, in order to make variously
        distorted casts of the same object.</p>
    <p>The inclusion of the entry in the main text of the page, rather than in
        the margins, suggests that this shrinking process was an intentional
        supplement to the previous bread molding recipe on the same page. Yet,
        the recipe offers no explanation on why objects were cast in varying
        shapes and sizes, and the types of bread used in this process, despite
        the numerous bread varieties present during the period. Indeed, while
        Ms. Fr. 640 demonstrates an “appreciation of the characteristics of
        different flours,” descriptions of the breads used are brief.<a

        pith must be extracted and further kneaded (as with Lebrun’s entry) or
        if an object could be imprinted onto the pith of the bread as is. It is
        thus unclear which specific material qualities or types of bread are of
        greatest use for bread molding. Combined with the vagueness of the
        entry’s instructions, reconstruction is therefore useful in clarifying
        potential intermediary steps taken by the author-practitioner as well as
        the material qualities of bread used in this process. It also serves as
        a proof-of-concept that shrinking the bread mold, as described on fol.

    <p>For this reconstruction, I prepared nine loaves of bread with varying
        ratios of organic stone-ground rye, whole wheat, and refined wheat
        flour, reflecting grains used for bread in the sixteenth century (Table
        1). For historical accuracy, these loaves were produced based on an
        adaptation of John Evelyn’s 1664 recipe for “House-hold Bread.”<a

        then kneaded until it passed the “windowpane test,” that is, until a
        portion of the dough could be stretched thin enough for light to pass
        through without tearing the dough, indicating that the gluten had

    <h2 id="ii-preparation-of-bread-molds">(ii) Preparation of bread molds</h2>
    <p>Each loaf was halved immediately as it came out of the oven. Bread molds
        were then prepared from the baked loaves using two different methods,
        one for each half of the bread. For the first method, half of the bread
        was further divided into three to four slices of approximately 1–2
        centimeters in thickness, then set aside for imprinting (Method A). For
        the second method, borrowing from Lebrun’s instructions, the pith of the
        remaining half of the bread was extracted from its crust. It was then
        kneaded with a rolling pin until the pith “no longer st[u]ck” to the
        pin, and a smooth, flat surface of similar thickness as Method A was
        produced.<a href="#fn34"

           id="fnref34"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a> This kneaded pith was then
        quartered (Method B).</p>
    <h2 id="iii-impression-making">(iii) Impression making</h2>
    <p>Two copies of brooch- or medal-like objects in three different designs
        were prepared by casting beeswax into silicone molds (<i><u>Fig. 2</u></i>). For Loaves #1 to #7, one copy of each brooch design (heart, oval,
        and diamond) was imprinted into the bread molds prepared with Method A,
        and another was impressed into the pith produced with Method B, in order
        to evaluate how each method affected the clarity of the imprints made.
        The imprinting was done by firmly pressing the objects into the bread
        piths until they remained in the molds without springing back out.
        Borrowing from Lebrun’s instructions, the brooches were left in their
        bread molds and unmolded only when the molds had dried, approximately
        one to three days later. This method produced clearer imprints than
        immediately unmolding the objects did.</p>

    <p>For Loaf #8, brooches with the heart design were imprinted onto all of

        Loaf #9. For both loaves, the objects were immediately unmolded once an
        impression capturing the original dimensions of each design was made (c.
        3–4 minutes).</p>
    <h2 id="iv-drying-and-reheating-of-bread-molds">(iv) Drying and reheating of
        bread molds </h2>
    <p>The number of days between baking Loaves #1 to #5 and casting of each of
        their imprints was kept as consistent as possible to ensure
        near-identical durations in the drying out of the bread molds (Table 2).
        These loaves consequently dried for a span of eight to ten days before
        casting. The number of days between baking and casting, and thus for the
        loaves to dry out, was then reduced to three to four days for Loaves #6
        and #7 (Table 2). Loaves #8 and #9 were baked and cast on the same day
        (Table 2). The influence of the drying process on the shrinking of the
        bread molds, and of the resultant cast, was thus compared between Loaves
        #1, #6 and #8 (Set A), and between Loaves #2, #7, and #9 (Set B), each
        set comprised of bread made using the same ingredients.</p>

    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>For Loaves #8 and #9, three of the four
        bread molds made from Methods A and B were returned to the oven and kept
        at a constant temperature of 200°F. In intervals of twenty to
        twenty-five minutes, a slice prepared according to Method A and one
        prepared with Method B were taken out of the oven, until all bread molds
        were removed.</p>
    <h2 id="v-sulfur-casting">(v) Sulfur casting </h2>
    <p>Before casting, the width and height of the impressions made on Loaves #1
        to #9 were measured and compared to the dimensions of their original
        objects. Sulfur casting was subsequently conducted in two batches, with
        the first batch consisting of imprints made on Loaves #1 to #7, and the
        second from Loaves #8 and #9. For the first batch, melted sulfur was
        poured into these imprints and left for four days to harden before
        unmolding. To facilitate the removal of sulfur casts from their bread
        molds, these molds were soaked in water to soften the pith, which had
        become tough and impliable. Dimensions of the resultant sulfur casts
        (when successful) were then measured and inventoried.</p>
    <p>Given the difficulty of the unmolding process with the first batch, pure
        cold-pressed linseed oil was brushed onto the bread molds of Loaves #8
        and #9 before melted sulfur was cast into the imprints. The sulfur was
        left for thirty minutes until just solidified. The casts were then
        unmolded and their dimensions measured.</p>
    <h2 id="results">Results</h2>
    <p>Across all nine loaves, bread molds prepared with Method B, which
        separates the insides of the bread from its crust before kneading it,
        consistently produced clearer imprints than those of Method A, where the
        object was impressed directly into the loaf (<i><u>Fig. 3</u></i>).
        Impressions made on molds of Loaves #2, #3, #4, #7, and #9 in
        particular, which were made from whole wheat flour or a portion of
        refined wheat flour, successfully captured the details of the original
        object. These bread molds were moist and inelastic enough for the
        objects to remain within the impression as the loaves dried, and the
        pith did not crack when imprinted. On the other hand, loaves #1 and #8,
        produced entirely with refined wheat flour, produced bread molds that
        were drier and more elastic. The object consequently did not remain
        within the bread mold when it dried out, as the pith sprung back when
        the object was impressed on it. The impression formed was thus light and
        shallow. Bread molds of Loaf #5, made from 100% rye flour, were sticky
        and crumbled when sliced; moreover, the bread pith often split as the
        wax brooches were pressed into the mold, leading to cracks and holes in
        the imprints. Thus, the types of bread used in the bread molding process
        influenced the outcome of their sulfur casts, and the inclusion of whole
        wheat flour, or a portion of refined wheat flour, in the bread was a
        necessary factor in producing “very neat work,” as the
        author-practitioner instructs (fol. 140v). Moreover, Method B—separating
        the bread pith from its crust after baking, and subsequently kneading
        it—also produced better molds.</p>

    <p>Bread molds made using both methods also produced imprints—and
        consequently, casts—of reduced sizes, confirming the viability of
        “let[ting] the [bread mold] shrink” by “mak[ing] it dry” (fol. 140v).<a

        prepared with Method B (Fig. 4). With Loaves #5 and #6 (#5 made from rye
        flour and cast seven days after baking, and #6 of refined wheat flour,
        cast four days after baking) imprints on bread molds made using both
        Methods A and B had similar shrinkages (Fig. 4). Lebrun’s claim that
        kneading the bread pith (Method B) reduces the shrinkage of the bread
        mold thus remains unproven.</p>

    <p>Comparing the nine loaves, Loaf #1 (made from refined wheat flour) showed
        the greatest extent of shrinkage in its width, with an average
        retraction of 0.32 W x 0.16 H centimeters (Fig. 4). Loaf #2 on the other
        hand (containing 50% rye and 50% refined wheat flour) had an average
        retraction of 0.26 W x 0.29 H centimeters, shrinking the greatest in
        height (Fig. 4). Loaves #3 and #4 (containing whole wheat flour) showed
        similar retractions of 0.19 W x 0.14 H centimeters and 0.20 W x 0.10 H
        centimeters respectively, while Loaf #5 (made from 100% rye flour)
        demonstrated negligible shrinkage (<i><u>Fig. 5</u></i>). Given that the
        baking method and number of days between baking and casting were kept
        constant across these five loaves, the types of flour used in making the
        bread thus influenced the shrinkage of the bread molds as well. Set A,
        containing loaves made with refined wheat flour, dried out and shrunk
        more than loaves made with whole wheat flour, as with Set B (Table 3).
        Further, measurements of imprints from Set A (Loaves #1, #6, #8) and Set
        B (Loaves #2, #7, #9) indicate that drying out the bread molds for a
        longer duration increases the shrinkage of their impressions (Table 3).
        Table 3 also shows that imprints cast on the same day as their molds
        were produced (Loaves #8 and #9) had identical dimensions to their
        original objects. This confirms the viability of casting sulfur “without
        leaving the imprint of the bread to dry” to produce casts as big as
        their originals, as noted in fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/140v/f/140v/tl"><u>140v</u></a>.
        By making the mold “dry [...] more or less,” the imprints also “shrank”
        to different extents (fol. 140v).</p>

    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>Reheating bread molds from loaves #8 and
        #9 (the former made from refined wheat flour and the latter from whole
        wheat flour) led to an increase in the rate at which its imprints
        shrank. For Loaf #9, a twenty to twenty-five minute increase in
        reheating time for its bread molds resulted in an average shrinkage of
        0.13 x 0.10 centimeters per interval for molds produced using Method A,

        However, as the amount of time spent reheating the molds increased, the

    <p>The clarity of imprints made from bread molds produced with whole wheat
        flour, or a portion of refined wheat flour (Loaves #2, #3, #4, #7, and
        #9) suggests there is an ideal level of hydration and gluten for bread
        used in bread molding. This is reinforced when contrasted with the poor
        impressions made on Loaf #5. Produced with 100% rye flour, the loaf’s
        low gluten content, combined with the presence of pentosans (a group of
        complex sugars) within the dough, results in dense bread that easily
        breaks apart when mixed or imprinted.<a href="#fn37"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref37"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>37</sup></a> Conversely, the shallow and poor
        impressions made on Loaves #1 and #8 demonstrate that refined wheat
        flour, which is high in gluten, was also poorly suited for bread
        molding. Given that wheat flour was more commonly used in its unrefined
        form during the period, with refined white flour reserved for “superior
        bread” consumed by the wealthy, the flour ratios tested here that
        produced more successful bread molds in this reconstruction were likely
        more historically appropriate.<a href="#fn38"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref38"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>38</sup></a> This also confirms Emma Le
        Pouésard’s hypothesis, in her analysis of bread within Ms. Fr. 640, that
        the bread used by the author-practitioner was wheat bread—more
        specifically, whole wheat bread.<a href="#fn39"

    <p>That bread molds made using Method B (pith removal) consistently produced
        impressions that captured greater detail of the original object, as
        opposed to those prepared with Method A (direct imprinting on loaf),
        also clarifies the instructions on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/140v/f/140v/tl"><u>140v</u></a>
        to mold “with bread pith.” While the author-practitioner does not
        specify whether to remove the bread pith from its crust in order to
        produce the bread molds, the success of Method B over A suggests that
        separating the bread pith from the baked loaf and further manipulating
        it into a bread mold was a necessary step in the author-practitioner’s
        bread molding process. Further, for bread molds produced with Method A,
        bread pith that clung onto the sulfur casts could not be completely
        removed, even after oiling the imprints (<i><u>Fig. 8</u></i>). Imprints
        on these molds thus failed to produce clean copies of the original
        design when cast. While Lebrun’s entry suggests that Method B
        (extracting the bread pith from its crust and kneading it) would prevent
        shrinkage of the bread mold, the inconclusive results from this
        reconstruction demonstrate that Method B could still be employed for
        bread molding per the instructions on fol. 140v. This method compressed
        the crumb of the loaf, which allowed for the object to be imprinted
        without the crumb of the bread mold disrupting the details of the
        design. With Method B, the type of bread used had a smaller impact on
        the outcome, as the kneading process homogenized the density and
        openness of the crumb.</p>

    <p>Lebrun’s instructions to “always oil” the bread molds produced sulfur
        casts that were easily unmolded, without any remnants of bread on them.
        The application of linseed oil to the imprints in this reconstruction
        also had the added effect of preserving the bread molds, allowing
        repeated casts of the same impression to be made, a real asset for a
        craftsman who wanted to reuse materials to save both time and money.
        Just as the author-practitioner failed to clarify what he meant by
        molding “with bread pith,” he also seems to have omitted necessary
        intermediary steps within the bread molding entries on fol. 140v—either
        unintentionally or assuming they were commonly known.</p>
    <p>With regard to the shrinking process, reheating the bread molds increased
        the rate at which the imprints retracted compared to leaving the
        impressions to naturally dry out. The author-practitioner’s suggestion
        to use bread that is “reheated twice” for a greater shrinkage, combined
        with the reusability of molds, thus provided a quick, accessible, and
        cheap alternative for a craftsman under constraints of time or resources
        to produce multiple casts of various sizes (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/140v/f/140v/tl"><u>140v</u></a>).

    <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Bread was easily accessible and used in a variety of craft and artistic
        practices in early modern Europe, but it is unclear whether the bread
        molding documented by the author-practitioner and Lebrun were isolated
        instances. My reconstruction thus serves as a proof-of-concept of the
        process, demonstrating the viability of producing sulfur casts from
        imprints made on bread. Bread molds into which sulfur was cast may have
        formed a quick method of testing the sharpness of details or the overall
        form of a casting pattern in the process of being carved, or to test
        whether details remained clear when a mold shrank.<a href="#fn40"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref40"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>40</sup></a> Given the wide availability and
        relative cheapness of bread, such a method could save time and expense.
        The speed and convenience that bread molding afforded may explain why
        the author-practitioner mentioned in the entry on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/140v/f/140v/tl"><u>140v</u></a>
        that sulfur could be cast “without leaving the imprint of the bread to
        dry.”</p>
    <p>My reconstruction demonstrates that, in the right circumstances,
        shrinking is also possible. This reconstruction was useful in clarifying
        the material realities of the rarely-discussed process of bread molding,
        for instance, determining how different types of breads influence the
        process and outcome of the mold. In particular, bread molds produced
        entirely or with a portion of whole wheat flour, which was high in
        gluten, produced imprints that successfully captured the details of the
        original object, and demonstrated sizeable shrinkage when dried out
        and/or reheated. Loaves produced from refined wheat flour, on the other
        hand, resulted in light and shallow imprints, and consequently,
        distorted and brittle sulfur casts. Bread molds made entirely from rye
        flour, which is low in gluten, broke apart easily when manipulated,
        leading to cracks in the impressions made and demonstrated negligible
        shrinkage.</p>
    <p>This reconstruction also highlights how Lebrun’s instructions on bread
        molding, while different from the author-practitioner’s, might reveal
        necessary intermediary steps within the bread molding process absent in
        the entries on fol. 140v. This includes separating the bread pith from
        its crust, kneading it to produce bread molds, and oiling the imprints
        and unmolding the objects from them only after the molds have dried.
        Lebrun’s suggestion, however, that removing the insides of the bread and
        then kneading them would result in bread molds with reduced shrinkage
        when dried, remains unproven. A detailed, step-by-step reconstruction of
        Lebrun’s bread molding process and a subsequent comparison with the
        bread molding entries on fol. 140v in Ms. Fr. 640 would be useful in
        clarifying this set of instructions and whether the two bread molding
        methods were intended for different purposes.</p>
    <p>Just as bread provided the possibility of casting objects in a reduced
        size, enabling a craftsman to experiment with scale, the reverse may
        also be possible; as the author-practitioner notes, one could “vary the
        figure” by “elongating and widening the imprinted bread pith” as well.
        Whether or not the elasticity and pliability of bread lent itself to
        casting objects in larger sizes or in distorted versions of the original
        merits further research. Nonetheless, this preliminary study
        demonstrates that bread was not only an object of consumption in the
        manuscript’s historical context but was a material whose specific
        properties made it suited for use in intermediary processes such as
        impression-making and object-casting within the workshop as well.</p>

                    ajoutez-y un peu d'aloes dans la crainte que les vers né s'y

                    Ayez soin de pousser dans les noirs avec autant de soin que
                    vous le pourrez. Laisser sécher, renversez la médaille,
