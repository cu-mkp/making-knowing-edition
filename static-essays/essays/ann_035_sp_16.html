            <p>“Apprenticeship of the painter” on fol. <a

                identifies the oval and the cross as fundamental shapes for
                aspiring artists to master. The disposition of the text and its
                accompanying sketches suggest something of the
                author-practitioner’s thought process in setting down his
                advice. This essay situates his notion of apprenticeship in the
                context of model books, art treatises, and artistic training in
                early modern Europe. While young artists were understood to
                require a knowledge of geometry and anatomy, this knowledge was
                of a practical and embodied kind—inculcated through the
                pedagogical practice of copying and aided by workshop shortcuts,
                such as the advice about the oval and the cross offered in Ms.
                Fr. 640.</p>

    <p>We know relatively little about the professional training of the
        anonymous author-practitioner who compiled BnF Ms. Fr. 640, although
        select comments he peppers across the manuscript allow us to glean a few
        important insights about his workshop and its organization.<a

        <em>quelque garson de boutique</em> (a shop boy) and <em>ton garson</em>
        (your boy) for the processes he describes on fols. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/123v/f/123v/tl"><u>123v</u></a>

        respectively, it is unclear if the author-practitioner supervised
        apprentices in his own workspace. Nevertheless, he clearly had opinions
        about the proper training of young artists. This essay focuses on the
        entry “<em>Aprentissaige du paintre</em>” (“Apprenticeship of the
        painter”) on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/64v/f/64v/tl"><u>64v</u></a>,
        which contains the author-practitioner’s practical advice for the
        would-be painter. Unlike many other entries in the manuscript, this one
        was not the result of an uninterrupted flow of writing. A careful
        examination of the entry’s script and sketches allows a reconstruction
        of the author-practitioner’s thought process in putting down these
        recipes. This helps us attain a better understanding of how he might
        have conceptualized the subjects under discussion—their relevance for
        the painter’s craft and their connection to contemporary art treatises
        and instruction manuals.</p>
    <p>The title “Apprenticeship of the painter” and the first block of text
        form a coherent unit that discusses the fundamentals of drawing and the
        importance of the oval as the basis for drawing a human face (<i><u>Fig. 1</u></i>). There is nothing to suggest an interruption of the
        author-practitioner’s flow of thought or writing. However, the style,
        size, and position of the script of the next block of text suggest that
        he added it some time after writing the first. This next section could
        be interpreted as a second entry in and of itself under the heading “One
        also presents him with these strokes &amp; lines.” However, the size of
        the gap between the two paragraphs is not unlike those appearing between
        text blocks in other entries in the manuscript that contain multiple
        paragraphs, and it seems most likely that he understood this second
        block of text to continue the overarching subject of apprenticeship that
        he began with the first.</p>

    </div>
    <p>The second text block shows a much more interrupted flow of thought. The
        author-practitioner started by writing a capital “C,” yet he immediately
        changed it to an “L,” and carried on with composing his sentence: <em>La
            figure de l’œuf pour visaiges</em> (The figure of the egg for
        faces). Moreover, the full sentence reads, <em>
            <del>C</del>La figure de loeuf pour visaiges <sup>et pour les corps
                plies</sup> est le principal patron
        </em> (The figure of the egg is the main pattern for faces and for
        curled-up bodies), as if it were the product of a continuous flow of
        thought. However, the script clearly shows that “and for curled-up
        bodies” was a later, interlinear addition. After the author-practitioner
        wrote the sentence <em>La figure de l’œuf pour visaiges est le principal
            patron</em> (The figure of the egg is the main pattern for faces),
        he added <em>&amp; la croix</em> (&amp; the cross), but he seems to have
        immediately crossed out these three words and replaced them with
        <em>co{mm}e la croix est le modelle du plant droict &amp; entier</em>
        (as the cross is the model for a straight &amp; whole figure). This
        change suggests that the author-practitioner did not initially associate
        the utility of the oval with that of the cross. He seems to have only
        considered the oval shape of the egg as a follow-up to the discussion of
        drawing the human face in the previous paragraph. It thus seems likely
        that the words “and for curled-up bodies” were added after he put down
        “as the cross is the model for a straight &amp; whole figure,” as he was
        making a connection between these shapes as the two fundamental forms of
        the human figure. Then, perhaps, only after he finished writing all
        these texts, and probably also after making the drawings, he went back
        to the beginning and added “One also presents him with these strokes
        &amp; lines,” which might be better considered an explanatory note for
        the both paragraphs and the drawing rather than a heading or title for
        an independent entry.</p>
    <p>While the text mentions only the oval and cross as the underlying forms
        of the human body, there are four drawings below “Apprenticeship of the
        painter” (<i><u>Fig. 2</u></i>). Apart from a curled-up body within an
        oval and a standing figure on the right, there is another standing
        figure on the far left (not formed on the template of a cross) as well
        as a reclining figure stretched backwards over the arc of a partial
        oval.</p>

    <p>The preceding speculative reconstruction of the author-practitioner’s
        flow of thought and pen suggests several points. First, the
        author-practitioner might not have initially planned to include drawings
        to illustrate “Apprenticeship of the painter” until he thought beyond
        the face toward the body as a whole, and, then, about the human body’s
        relationship to basic geometrical shapes. Second, the oval may not have
        been a common geometrical form associated with the entire human body at
        that time, and thus not as familiar to the author-practitioner as a
        standing figure represented by a cross. Third, although the
        author-practitioner only discussed the oval and the cross, he also
        considered it necessary to show the other two figures because “these
        strokes &amp; lines”<a href="#fn2"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref2"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> seemed to him foundational for
        training an artist: “without these strokes,” the apprentice “will never
        do well” (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/64v/f/64v/tl"><u>64v</u></a>).
    </p>
    <p>The foregoing analysis raises the following questions that this essay
        aims to tackle: Why did the author-practitioner make these drawings?
        What might the potential context for the drawings be, and from where
        could they have been derived? As the instructions are concerned with the
        apprenticeship of painters, I will address these questions in relation
        to the training of apprentices for the painter’s craft. Due to the
        schematic and spontaneous character of the sketches, it is difficult to
        locate precisely their source and context, thus the suggestions I offer
        here are neither definitive nor exhaustive.</p>

        painting. A key treatise for the context of this section of the
        manuscript is the <em>Livre de pourtraiture</em> (1571) by Jean Cousin
        the Younger (ca.1522–1595), a didactic drawing book that aimed to teach
        young artists the proportions of the human body.<a href="#fn3"

        perspective, <em>Livre de perspective</em> (1560), which contained
        mathematical and theoretical constructions of perspective. In the
        preface of <em>Livre de perspective</em>, Cousin the Elder mentioned
        that his son was preparing a book on drawing, which dealt with “the
        practice of perspective” (<em>la practique de perspective</em>).<a

        proportions of human bodies.<a href="#fn7"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref7"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> Taken together, then, the books
        of Jean Cousin the Elder and the Younger seem intended to form a course
        on art theory and practice for the aspiring painter. As will be pursued
        below, these two books—and their exemplification of the two poles of
        theory and practice—can help us understand the context of the drawings
        on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/64v/f/64v/tl"><u>64v</u></a>
        of Ms. Fr. 640. I argue that the author-practitioner’s drawings, like
        those of Cousin the Younger, help us visualize the mode of training in
        an early modern painter’s workshop. A master taught by demonstrating,
        and an apprentice learned by copying. What the drawings show are a
        variety of the most basic human postures, including crouching, lying,
        and standing. These postures also suggest different stages of human
        life—a baby curled up in a womb, an adult, and a corpse—and, as the
        apprentice absorbed such visual templates through the practice of
        copying, he could put them to use later in a variety of compositions.
    </p>
    <p>In his book, Cousin the Younger called himself an “outstanding
        geometrician” (<em>Geometrien tres-excellent</em>). His book also
        borrowed illustrations from contemporary anatomical treatises such as
        <em>De humani corporis fabrica</em> (1543) by the Brussels-born
        physician Andreas Vesalius (1514–1564).<a href="#fn8"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref8"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> Training in geometry and anatomy
        were viewed in the sixteenth century as essential to a painter’s
        apprenticeship, and both were seen to enable a painter to create
        well-proportioned figures. But what did geometry and anatomy mean to a
        young apprentice <em>in practice</em> and in the (pedagogical) context
        of a painter’s workshop? Early modern geometry was based on the
        Euclidean system that assumed a small set of axioms from which many
        other theorems were deduced. This intellectual approach had a practical
        counterpart in the painter’s workshop: an artisan’s understanding of
        geometry was shaped through his embodied work—the skills and habits of
        his hand—and experience.<a href="#fn9"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref9"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> Similarly, although anatomy was a
        systematic study of the human body within university medical faculties,
        it was also growing to include a practical dimension based on dissection
        and close observation. If we investigate the drawings on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/64v/f/64v/tl"><u>64v</u></a>
        through the lens of daily <em>practices</em> of geometry and anatomy in
        the early modern workshop, we gain a better understanding of the origins
        of the author-practitioner’s intriguing conception of a painter’s
        apprenticeship.</p>
    <h2 id="learning-by-copying">Learning by Copying</h2>
    <p>According to the author-practitioner, the strokes and lines in his
        sketches were meant to be <em>shown</em> to the apprentices. What was
        first shown, then, is the nature of the lines themselves. The
        author-practitioner drew these images with a very light touch. There
        seems a marked difference between the pressure he put on the pen when
        writing the text and when making the drawings. Other images in the
        manuscript, such as the tools needed for tempering sand depicted on fol.
        <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/112r/f/112r/tl"><u>112r</u></a>
        (<i><u>Fig. 3</u></i>), are made up of stronger and more calculated
        lines than those in these sketches accompanying “Apprenticeship of the
        painter” on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/64v/f/64v/tl"><u>64v</u></a>.
        Here, he used only a few spare, spontaneous strokes to roughly define
        the general features of a figure. His execution of these sketches
        corresponds to his instructions in an entry entitled “Drawing”
        (“<em>Pourtraire</em>”) on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/62r/f/62r/tl"><u>62r</u></a>.
        One should, he notes, first draw the outline of the subject “lightly
        &amp; without any too careful work, but boldly,” so that “if you need to
        undo anything, you will not waste as much time as if you had elaborated
        it.” By drawing in this way, he claims, “you will teach yourself to be
        an artist.” This suggests that his drawing instructions may reflect the
        training given to apprentice artists. Cennino Cennini (ca. 1360–before
        1427), when discussing “how drawings with the pen should be practiced”
        in his <em>Il libro dell’arte</em>, likewise advised that one should
        “draw lightly.”<a href="#fn10"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref10"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> Similarly, the

        where he advised the apprentice to draw with a light line when starting
        a work. Such light lines, however preliminary, were also an index of
        artistic ability, for, as he notes, “by a line of charcoal, masters pass
        judgement on their apprentices.”</p>

        compiled into model books, which were widely used in early modern
        painters’ workshops. These books contained figures and motifs for young
        artists to copy and hone their skills; they were also used to inform
        commissioned works, providing a repertoire of pictorial solutions for
        various compositional challenges. Odoardo Fialetti’s (1573–1637/38)
        model book <em>Il vero modo et ordine</em> (1608) comprised a series of
        progressively more complete studies of the human figure, beginning with
        the individual parts of the body, moving to full figures, and then
        proceeding to scenes with multiple people. This corresponds to the
        author-practitioner’s opinion on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/64v/f/64v/tl"><u>64v</u></a>
        that an apprentice should draw “half a face, then a whole one with the
        ears, next the neck, then the parts of the body separately, next joined,
        then one figure, then two &amp; three, finally a history.” Fialetti’s
        book started with a full-page plate of eyes (<i><u>Fig. 4</u></i>),
        offering a systematic progression of lines and shapes for the
        delineation of the eye in profile and frontal view, building complex
        structures from simpler starting points. A second page of eyes shows
        different views of each eye in a more finished state. Drawings of model
        eyes also appear in depictions of painter’s workshops by both
        Pierfrancesco Alberti (1584–1638) and Jan van der Straet or Stradanus
        (1523–1605). On the lower left side of Alberti’s etching (<i><u>Fig. 5</u></i>), a senior master is pointing to a sheet with drawings
        of different perspectives and types of eyes in order to instruct his
        apprentices. In the lower right of Stradanus’s print (<i><u>Fig. 6</u></i>), a young apprentice is drawing eyes of different sorts. Following
        the program in Fialetti’s model book, such young apprentices might move
        on to delineate other body parts, such as the nose, lips, and ears
        before moving on to full faces and finally narrative scenes with crowds
        of people.</p>

    <h2 id="the-practice-of-perspective">The Practice of Perspective</h2>
    <p>The central purpose of making a drawing before beginning to paint was to
        achieve the right proportions for the composition. As the
        author-practitioner mentioned on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/62r/f/62r/tl"><u>62r</u></a>
        under the heading “Drawing,” after the painter finished his drawing, he
        should “step away from it to better judge the proportions.” The
        author-practitioner had much experience considering proportions. For
        example, in the sections of Ms. Fr. 640 dedicated to cannons and
        armaments, proportional relationships (between weapon parts, between
        caliber and charge) and conceptualizations of measure and proportion are
        key features of the entries. For example, on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/17r/f/17r/tl"><u>17r</u></a>,
        the cannon-perrier is noted to have “a large ball of the King’s caliber
        like the others, namely of 40 lb. It bears in the breech only the width
        of two balls &amp; a quarter of a ball. The front only bears the width
        of one ball &amp; a third of a ball.” By comparison, small faulconets
        “which are under 3 quintals one gives them at least 3 balls &amp; a
        twelfth part of a ball at the breech, &amp; sometimes takes away from
        the front to make this addition to the breech, according to the length
        one gives them” (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/19r/f/19r/tl"><u>19r</u></a>).
    </p>
    <p>Jean Cousin the Younger’s <em>Livre de pourtraiture,</em> dedicated to
        demonstrating techniques of constructing human proportions to
        apprentices, represents an application of this kind of proportional
        calculation to human figures. Besides describing the proportions of the
        human figure, his book demonstrates a systematic method of
        foreshortening the human body in all positions by means of geometric
        projections. Dürer, in his pioneering work <em>Vier Bücher von
            menschlicher Proportion</em> (1528), only showed how to treat the
        foreshortening of the human head and foot. Cousin the Younger extended
        this methodology to the perspectival construction of the entire human
        figure, claiming his method could be extended to all postures (<i><u>Fig. 7</u></i>).</p>

    <p>In his book, Cousin the Younger also included a discussion of the primary
        figures that underlie perspective and are thus the elements of form,
        including perpendicular lines, intersecting lines (which appear as a
        cross), angles, the straight line, and the curve (i.e., the section of a
        circle) (<i><u>Fig. 8</u></i>). Similarly, Cousin the Elder’s book had
        included a page dedicated to basic forms such as the line, circle,
        square, cross, and triangle (<i><u>Fig. 9</u></i>). The
        author-practitioner’s conceptualization of the human body as structured
        by a cross could have been inspired by the illustrations in Cousin the
        Younger’s book. It contains an image in which Cousin conceived of the
        human body as composed of two almost perpendicular axes, with each axis
        divided proportionally (<i><u>Fig. 10</u></i>), a depiction that bears

    <p>Although invisible in Cousin the Younger’s manual, it was with the use of
        tools that early modern artisans constructed basic forms, perspectival
        constructions, and even human figures. The compass was particularly
        useful in this regard. Tiny pin-pricks at the center of the cannonballs
        illustrated on fols. <a

        of Ms. Fr. 640 show that even the author-practitioner used a compass in
        his own drawing practice. Dürer also assumed that the essence of a form
        was derived from the primary geometrical figures constructed through the
        use of drawing and measuring tools. Although images of early modern
        workshops do not necessarily represent reality, there is no doubt that
        measuring tools were used in painters’s workshops, and constructing the
        basic polygonal forms was an important component of apprenticeship. In
        the center of Pierfrancesco Alberti’s print (Fig. 5), a master is
        pointing with a stick toward a panel on which an apprentice is measuring
        the length of a line with a compass. Another master and two more young
        boys are looking on. By putting this crowd at the center of his etching,
        Alberti emphasized the importance of geometry to the training of the
        apprentice painter, particularly in the sense of using tools to
        construct geometrical forms and to proportion them correctly. Dürer’s
        <em>Underweysung der Messung</em> <em>mit dem Zirckel und
            Richtscheyt</em> (1525), often considered one of the first books
        north of the Alps to deal systematically with “geometry,” pays homage to
        Euclid in its preface. However, as the full title of the book indicates,
        it comprises “lessons for measuring with the compass and ruler,” which
        demonstrates that Dürer’s conception of geometry for artists meant the
        construction and accurate proportioning of polygonal forms with the
        common measuring tools of the workshop. For example, his instructions
        for constructing a regular hexagon begin:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>First I shall construct a figure with six corners because it can be
            made without changing the opening of the compass. Take a compass and
            place one leg on center point a and with the other side draw a
            circle of the desired size, large or small. Then move the compass
            without changing its opening, to the periphery of the circle, and
            mark off this distance on it. Then continue along the periphery in

    <p>The author-practitioner’s depiction of the ruler and plumb line used for
        perspective alerts us to a noteworthy point: while images are not
        infrequent in Ms. Fr. 640, they do not appear as often in recipes
        concerned with painting. Of the 170 folios in Ms. Fr. 640, eighty-two
        have images. However, only four of the recipes with accompanying images
        have to do with painting. Apart from “Apprenticeship of the painter” on
        fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/64v/f/64v/tl"><u>64v</u></a>

        another recipe on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/19v/f/19v/tl"><u>19v</u></a>
        entitled “Mathematical figures without ruler and compass” contains an
        image related to the arts of drawing and painting. Its title, referring
        to “mathematical figures,” raises expectations for a theoretical
        discussion but, instead, the recipe contains a shortcut to create a
        symmetrical form by drawing on one side of the paper with ink and then
        folding the paper so that the pattern will be transferred onto the other
        side (<i><u>Fig. 13</u></i>).<a href="#fn23"

        The author-practitioner uses images (<i><u>Fig. 14</u></i>) to
        illustrate the proper angle at which to hold the brush so that it casts
        a shadow that helps indicate the direction of the light in the image,
        which should not appear “too crude and too harsh.” He also specifies the
        angle at which a painting should be positioned in relation to the light
        source: not “facing the light head-on” but “half turned against it”
        (fol. 61r). Thus, all the recipes for the painter with accompanying
        images are essentially concerned with the tools and their proper
        handling for constructing naturalistic drawings and paintings.</p>

    <p>A broader survey of all the images in Ms. Fr. 640 shows that they, too,
        are often about the appearance and function of artisanal tools. For

        margin shows the variety of tools needed for the task, such as a basin,
        mold, brush, pen, feather pipe, and compass (Fig. 3). Similarly, the
        recipes concerned with sleight of hand tricks often have images
        accompanying their texts; when they do, the images address the
        construction of special devices to achieve the deceptive sleights of

        in the context of other images in Ms. Fr. 640 reveals that these
        “strokes and lines” seem to have emerged out of practical concerns and
        for practical ends. We begin to understand the relationship between
        these drawings and the hands-on mode of apprenticeship. Perspective or
        geometry was seen as essential to an apprentice’s training, but young
        painters were trained in using the tools of measurement rather than
        being taught perspective as a form of geometrical demonstration or of
        purely numerical calculation. They acquired this knowledge through
        practical techniques and hands-on experience.</p>
    <h2 id="the-practice-of-anatomy">The Practice of Anatomy</h2>
    <p>Cousin the Younger’s <em>Livre de pourtraiture</em> borrowed and adapted
        many illustrations from contemporary anatomical treatises. For example,
        his plate showing the proportion of a man’s torso (<i><u>Fig. 16</u></i>) comes from an image of one of the muscle men in Vesalius’s <em>De
            humani corporis fabrica</em> (1543) (<i><u>Fig. 17</u></i>). Cousin
        the Younger’s incorporation of anatomy and perspective in his book

    <p>Over the course of the sixteenth century, anatomy was emerging in medical
        faculties as an empirical art, one which relied on the anatomist’s use
        of his hands and eyes. Vesalius’s book is underpinned by the practice of
        dissection, and he states explicitly that the structure of the human
        body must be established on the basis of observation from dissections.
        The author-practitioner uses the word “<em>anatomie</em>” once in Ms.
        Fr. 640, by which he means an animal skeleton obtained by the process
        detailed on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/120v/f/120v/tl"><u>120v</u></a>:
        “One needs to skin the animal &amp; boil it, or else skin it &amp; put
        it into good quicklime.”</p>
    <p>If we return to the Alberti print depicting the interior of a painter’s
        workshop (Fig. 5), we see that even though the central group thematizes
        the importance of geometry—manifest in acts of measuring with tools—the
        activities taking place around the central group are related to the
        study of the human figure. Casts of fragmented body parts are displayed
        high on the wall. On the left, a young boy is copying after the model of
        a leg. To the right, an apprentice is copying after a skeleton, and a
        group of people are inspecting a cadaver around a dissection table. What
        is represented here is the view that the ability to understand and
        represent the human figure is to be learned by the practical skills of
        observing with one’s own eyes and dissecting and measuring with one’s
        own hands: expertise is attained by repeated copying “from life.”</p>
    <p>By the late sixteenth century, anatomy had become an essential part of a
        painter’s apprenticeship. In 1589, the Antwerp engraver and print
        publisher Philips Galle (1537–1612) published a drawing book entitled
        <em>Instruction and Fundamentals of Good Portraiture</em>
        (<em>Instruction et Fondements de Bien Pourtraire</em>), with the
        subtitle “for apprenticed youth and all who feel disposed to become
        painters, sculptors, goldsmiths or like artisans.”<a href="#fn25"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref25"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a> The book contains a title page,
        a one-page introduction, and thirteen engravings focusing on human
        anatomy. The series comprises four three-print sets of a human figure
        seen from the front, in profile, and from behind. The four sets depict a
        skeleton, an <em>écorché</em>, a nude man, and a nude woman. A single
        sheet showing three nude children seen from three perspectives concludes
        the series.</p>
    <p>Galle intended this book to provide a basic knowledge of anatomy for
        young apprentices. In his introduction, he explained his reason for
        publishing such a book:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>for most frequently, one sees that apprentices, although long engaged
            in the practice of draftsmanship, nevertheless still toil in
            darkness, as it were, the which proceeds from an incomprehension of
            fundamental matters. How can one draw or paint perfectly without
            knowledge of the skeleton? Or how is he to understand the muscles
            (which can only be perceived through the skin with difficulty) if
            wholly unversed in anatomy?<a href="#fn26"
               class="footnote-ref"
               id="fnref26"
               role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>He observed this lack of anatomical
        knowledge “in many people, even in those who would take it amiss not to
        be ranked with the very best,” and he “therefore considered it fitting
        for the young to become conversant with the form and composition of the
        bones of the dead, and thus to sample anatomy a little.”<a href="#fn27"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref27"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
    <p>Like geometry, anatomy is concerned with human proportion. The English
        physician and anatomist Francis Glisson (1597–1677) considered that the
        words “Anatome and Anatomia … signify an artificial dissection of that
        object in such manner as may most conduce to the perfect knowledge of
        the same and all its parts.”<a href="#fn28"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref28"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a> Anatomists therefore cut deep
        inside the human body in order to understand the general structure of
        the whole, the formation and texture of every part, and the relationship
        between the whole and the parts. As Andrew Cunningham shows in his study
        of anatomy as it was taught in the early modern university, the study of
        the structure of the whole includes the study of the body’s general
        proportion, and the study of its parts involves understanding the
        proportion every element holds to other parts and to the whole.<a

        based on his empirical observation of the human body during dissection,
        is titled <em>De humani corporis fabrica</em>, namely, “the fabric of
        the human body.” In it, he suggests principles of proportion for the
        interior structure of the body. For example, he points out the
        proportional sizes of the first three carpal bones.<a href="#fn30"

    <p>Vesalius’s book had a significant impact on the development of medicine,
        and it was of great importance to doctors and surgeons. But it also
        greatly influenced artists. Beautifully illustrated in collaboration
        with Jan Steven van Calcar, the details of the body parts were
        meticulously represented. The Flemish anatomist himself was also very
        conscious about how his book might benefit artists, and he intentionally
        created the images so as to better serve their needs. He writes in the
        first paragraph of Book Two that “the membranes apparent in the face and
        neck of the third table and also the muscular fibers depicted, are more
        inclined to trouble the painter, the sculptor and the molder, to whose
        pursuits I wish to be of benefit.”<a href="#fn31"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref31"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a> He also writes that “these
        plates display a total view of the scheme of muscles such as only
        painters and sculptors are wont to consider.”<a href="#fn32"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref32"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a> In Book Two, Vesalius first
        displays the anterior of the superficial muscles of the body, and then
        proceeds to expose the deeper muscles layer by layer. Muscles that are
        intact in the previous plate are lifted away in the following plate.
        This certainly corresponds to the progression of the dissection, but
        Vesalius also bears in mind how this procedure could help the artists in
        a practical way. He believes that artists</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>should not be satisfied with an exact knowledge of the superficial
            muscles; they must also have a detailed acquaintance with the bones,
            and must make sure they are fully conversant with the function of
            each muscle, so that they may know when they should draw some muscle
            shorter, or longer, or more protuberant, or more compressed.<a

    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>In other words, the ability to gauge the
        length and size of human muscles, as well as their contractions, is
        critical for any painter who wants to realize a naturalistic human
        figure.</p>
    <p>The plate Cousin the Younger used to show the proportion of a human arm
        is partially borrowed from Vesalius’s treatise (<i><u>Fig. 18</u></i>).
        This is Vesalius’s second plate in Book Two showing the side view of a
        body, with the skin, the fleshy membrane, all the superficial nerves,
        veins, and arteries having been cut away. The figure bears a resemblance
        to the leftmost striding figure in the drawings on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/64v/f/64v/tl"><u>64v</u></a>.
        This figure has an arched back, parted legs. and outstretched arms.

    <p>The arched back of the striding figure at the left of the sketches on
        fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/64v/f/64v/tl"><u>64v</u></a>
        is drawn by the author-practitioner as part of the lines that make up
        “the figure of the egg,” an oval shape. The author-practitioner shows
        the versatility of the oval as a basic form for constructing the human
        body—it defines the arched or curled back of a striding, reclining, and
        crouching figure. The human body was frequently conceived as a circle,
        and this visual analogy was commonly seen in architectural and
        geometrical treatises, such as the well-known drawing of Vitruvian Man
        by Leonardo da Vinci (1452–1519). Indeed, the curled up figure in the
        egg shape on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/64v/f/64v/tl"><u>64v</u></a>
        brings to mind other drawings by Da Vinci based on his observation of a
        fetus cut from the cadaver of a pregnant woman. His drawing of a fetus
        in a breech position within an opened-up uterus bears some resemblance
        to the drawing on fol. 64v (<i><u>Fig. 20</u></i>). In the other
        studies, Leonardo depicts the fetus from different angles. But from
        whatever angle the fetus is portrayed, its body is always curled into an
        oval or a circle (<i><u>Fig. 21</u></i>), just as the
        author-practitioner notes that “the egg is the main pattern … for bent
        bodies” (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/64v/f/64v/tl"><u>64v</u></a>).
        Leonardo’s drawings are found in a six-hundred-folio manuscript codex
        that has been in the possession of the British monarchs since the
        seventeenth century. But a textbook by Jacob Rüff (1500–1558) with the
        name <em>De conceptu et generatione hominis</em> (1554) had a much
        larger circulation and a wider audience.<a href="#fn36"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref36"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>36</sup></a> A woodcut from Rüff’s book also
        shows the coming child in a more or less naturalistic pose, curled up
        within an egg-shaped uterus (<i><u>Fig. 22</u></i>). Similarly, the
        egg-like curling of an infant body is twice depicted in the illustration
        in a 1582 pamphlet of a prodigy—the calcified fetus extracted from the
        womb of a ninety-year-old woman from Sens upon her death (<i><u>Fig. 23</u></i>). This image shows the child curled inside the
        uterus, still curled with parts of the uterus when it has been
        extracted, and extended for display. Over the course of the sixteenth
        century, medical practitioners took a greater interest in the anatomy of
        women; as a result, an increasing number of female bodies were opened up
        in public dissections, which were becoming more common.<a href="#fn37"

        could be a figure in the genre of a “sleeping Venus,” but it might also
        be a corpse. It might be male or female, dead or alive. The figure
        stretches itself out from the left side of the oval, bridging the curled
        figure with the cross. The inclusion of this reclining figure not only
        adds to the variety of the drawings depicted but also makes it possible
        to interpret these drawings as a meaningful set. On the left is a fetus
        in the womb and on the right is a standing male adult. The figure in the
        middle can bring these figures together into a series setting forth the
        compositional basis for depicting different types of bodies—baby, woman,
        and man—or different stages of life—newborn, adult, and corpse. The

    <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Later editions of Jean Cousin the Younger’s book include a subtitle:
        <em>la vraye science de la pourtraicture</em> (“the true science of
        portraiture”). This characterization of Cousin’s demonstration of human
        proportions as a “science,” implies a kind of certain knowledge about
        the human body that links it with theoretical treatises.<a href="#fn39"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref39"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>39</sup></a> However, Cousin’s book is
        characterized by a tension between theory and practice. He calls himself
        a “painter and geometrician,” the book deals with perspective yet
        focuses on its “practice,” and Cousin combines mathematical
        constructions with illustrations from the field of anatomy, which had
        evolved to understand the human figure empirically. His intended
        training for young apprentices, combining geometry and anatomy, may seem
        scholarly at first glance, yet it was, in fact, deeply rooted in
        workshop practice and dependent upon the empirical work and publications
        of his contemporaries.</p>
    <p>In Ms. Fr. 640, the author-practitioner talks about “mathematics” in
        terms of how to make and use tools for perspective construction. He also
        mentions anatomy, but here he is concerned entirely with the practical
        techniques of obtaining an animal skeleton. Inside an early modern
        artisan’s workshop, then, geometry and anatomy can be understood as
        practically oriented bodily activities. Fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/64v/f/64v/tl"><u>64v</u></a>
        is thus about the learning process of a young apprentice: an eye, a
        nose, a face, a figure, a crowd—the apprentice proceeds from copying a
        simple pattern to constructing a complex one, absorbing all the basic
        components of human figures along the way. Initially, he uses a compass
        and ruler to construct bodies and perspective; over time, he will
        “become an artist” (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/62v/f/62v/tl"><u>62v</u></a>),
        without need of tools. These <em>practices</em> are the elements of
        geometry and anatomy that are important for apprentices. They not only
        develop an eye for the fundamental forms of human figure, but also form
        the everyday experience of apprenticeship. “These strokes &amp; lines”
        that the master “also presents him,” and the apprentice’s bodily
        practice of copying and measuring based on these models and templates,
        constitute the terms in which geometry and anatomy are translated in the
        workshop into hands-on practices of imitation and observation.</p>

                <p>Expertise in “geometry” could mean many things in the early

                    paid homage to Euclid and Plato, but his exposition of
                    perspective is essentially in model book form, albeit of

                <p>The author-practitioner used the word <em>poinct</em>,
                    meaning “vanishing point,” as seen in many contemporary
                    treatises on perspective, including Jean Cousin the Elder’s
                    <em>Livre de perspective</em>. But the author-practitioner
                    also specified that the “point” is at the <em>desmenee</em>
                    (“intersection”) of all the lines. <em>Desmenee</em> meant
                    turbulence or unquiet motion at that time, and the
                    author-practitioner’s use of this term may indicate the
                    difficulty in finding the vanishing point for apprentices. I
                    have not found the use of <em>desmenee</em> in discussions

                <p>Bodies of pregnant women who died of childbirth were normally
                    inspected, and in sixteenth-century Bologna, there was also
                    a public dissection of a pregnant woman. Given that
                    illustrations of embryology and female reproductive organs
                    were increasingly circulated—and also seeing an opened up
                    female body became more common—it is possible that the
                    author-practitioner’s drawing was influenced by such
                    writings.<a href="#fnref38"
