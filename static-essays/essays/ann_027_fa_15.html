                titled “For tracing some history on glass,” the
                author-practitioner describes a technique now known as <em>verre
                    églomisé</em> that imitates <em>basse-taille</em>
                enamelling. This essay examines the reemergence of this ancient
                technique in early modern Italy and France, and it draws on
                early modern objects and technical manuals to how early modern
                artisans understood the tasks of the painter and the goldsmith
                as overlapping fields of artistic production with particular
                shared techniques, materials, and concerns for optical effect.

        and the techniques of painting on glass (fols. <a

           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/102v/f/102v/tl"><u>102v</u></a>).
        This indicates that the author-practitioner was not particularly
        interested in how glass was produced but rather in glass as a support
        for painting. This recipe, along with the other recipes concerning
        painting on glass, can thus be situated within a subset of recipes in
        the manuscript that address various techniques of painting.</p>
    <p>The recipe talks about three ways of “tracing some history on glass”
        (<em>trasser sur le verre quelque histoire</em>).<a href="#fn2"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref2"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> In this essay, we focus only on
        the third technique, that is, to “make gilt histories on glass with a
        background of colors, which imitates the basse-taille of goldsmiths”
        (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/39v/f/39v/tl"><u>39v</u></a>).
        The process can be broadly divided into four steps: gilding on glass,
        engraving patterns, applying color, and finally backing with a metal
        sheet. This technique is now called <em>verre églomisé</em>, an
        anachronistic term derived from eighteenth-century French decorator and
        art-dealer Jean-Baptiste Glomy (1711–1786), who was largely responsible
        for the technique’s revival.<a href="#fn3"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref3"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> This paper uses the term
        <em>verre églomisé</em> to denote this technique; however, it is
        important to bear in mind the technique’s long history before the term
        was coined in the eighteenth century.</p>
    <p>One of the many issues raised by this recipe is the link between painting
        and goldsmiths’ work in the early modern period and its implications for
        modern hierarchies of art and media. This link is implied by the
        author-practitioner’s description of the sought-after effect of the
        painted object in terms of goldsmiths’ techniques. Although the
        author-practitioner called it “tracing some history on glass,” this
        essay will consider it as a technique of “reverse painting on glass”
        because it was understood in the early modern period as technique
        primarily concerned with painting, both in terms of the characteristics
        of the objects it produced and the process involved to make it. It
        should be emphasized that the term <em>verre églomisé</em> is today
        associated with the “decorative arts” rather than with the “fine art” of
        painting. Thus, in addition to pointing out the fluid boundaries between
        the early modern professions of the painter and the goldsmith as well as
        their shared spheres of knowledge, this essay also aims to challenge the
        modern distinction of “artist” from “craftsman,” and it argues for a
        historicized understanding of “art” as <em>ars</em>.</p>
    <p>Our first question before starting the actual reconstruction work was to
        figure out what the final product was that the author-practitioner was
        aiming for. The recipe does not mention any information about the
        intended use of this type of painted glass, nor does it mention its
        scale. Therefore, it was not easy to envision the outcome of this
        recipe, and we first needed to carry out a thorough textual analysis
        accompanied by object-based historical research.</p>
    <p>One of the earliest surviving recipes concerning a technique similar to
        that mentioned on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/39v/f/39v/tl"><u>39v</u></a>
        can be found in Cennino Cennini’s <em>Il Libro dell’Arte</em> from the
        last years of the fourteenth century. The description Ceninni gives
        overlaps to a great extent with that on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/39v/f/39v/tl"><u>39v</u></a>.
        Following his discussion on stained glass painting, Cennini gives a
        detailed account of this technique, in which one shall “take a piece of
        white glass,” then use egg white to gild gold on the glass, to be
        followed by taking “a needle, fastened in a little stick as if it were a
        little brush” to “draw whatever figure you wish to make,” and finally
        applying “various colors ground in oil, such as ultramarine blue, black,
        verdigris, and lac.”<a href="#fn4"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref4"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
    <p>Already in ancient Rome, a similar technique was used to decorate
        medallions, roundels of cups, and other vessels (<i><u>Fig. 1</u></i>).
        A manuscript compiled in 1431 by Jehan le Begue, notary of the Master of
        the Mint at Paris, from recipes collected by Jehan Alcherius, contains a
        recipe similar to the <em>verre églomisé</em> technique, which according
        to Alcherius, was inspired by ancient Roman works. Alcherius wrote that
        “the Romans made themselves phials of glass, artfully varied with gold,
        very precious, to which I gave great pains and attention.”<a href="#fn5"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref5"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> He then tried to make a similar
        work himself, and the procedure he described is the same as the fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/39v/f/39v/tl"><u>39v</u></a>
        recipe in that the practitioner is to first wet the glass with gum
        water, then apply gold leaf onto it, and finally engrave images on the
        gold.<a href="#fn6"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref6"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> Theophilus Presbyter (fl. early

           id="fnref7"

    <p>A key clue in the recipe which enabled us to better contextualize the
        technique is the specific mention of the sought-after effect to imitate
        the <em>basse-taille</em> of goldsmiths. <em>Basse-taille</em> is an
        enameling technique in which the artist first creates a low-relief
        pattern on a metal surface by engraving or chasing, and then completely
        covers the metal surface with ground glass; when fired, the ground glass
        produces a translucent colored enamel, through which can be seen the low
        relief pattern.<a href="#fn9"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref9"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> The technique was probably
        developed in Italy around 1280, which coincided with the reappearance of
        <em>verre églomisé,</em> both being attested first in Tuscany.<a

    <p><em>Basse-taille</em> enamelling increasingly began to appear across
        Europe, notably in France and Flanders. From the mid-fourteenth century,
        Toulouse, where Ms. Fr. 640’s author-practitioner was likely based,
        would become an important center for the production of
        <em>basse-taille</em> enamels, along with Montpellier in southern
        France, Rouen in northern France, and Paris.<a href="#fn11"

        technique, likely comes from Toulouse. A manufactory of

                few have survived, as silver plate was often melted down to
                realize funds for the owner. The bottom of this vessel was
                decorated with a <em>basse-taille</em> translucent enameled
                plaque. France soon adapted the <em>basse-taille</em> enamelling
                technique since it was developed in Italy in the late thirteenth
                century, and Toulouse was one of the centers of production of
                <em>basse-taille</em> enamel. Permalink: <a

    <p>Most of the surviving <em>basse-taille</em> works from the late medieval
        and early modern period functioned as devotional objects and are
        characterized by their small size, glossy surface, and vivid color.
        Nevertheless, we cannot assume that this was the sole application of
        <em>basse-taille</em> enamel. Due to financial needs and the change of
        tastes, gold and silver works were often melted down or reused to create
        new types of objects, which could possibly explain the rare survival of
        <em>basse-taille</em> enamels for secular functions.</p>
    <p>Recipes in the sixteenth century often associate <em>basse-taille</em>
        enamelling with painting. In his preface to the <em>Lives of the Most
            Excellent Painters, Sculptors and Architects,</em> Giorgio Vasari
        (1511–1574) discussed a variety of techniques used in architecture,
        sculpture, and painting. He listed “enamels over reliefs” under the
        section on painting, followed by a discussion on stained glass painting
        and engraving, and he described enamelling as “a kind of painting
        intermingled with sculptures” (<em>e specie di pittura mescolata con la
            scultura</em>).<a href="#fn13"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref13"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> In his <em>Treatises</em>, the
        Italian artist Benvenuto Cellini (1500–1571) discussed in detail the
        <em>basse-taille</em> enamelling technique. He mentioned that “the
        method of enameling is much the same as painting,”<a href="#fn14"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref14"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> and instructed his readers to
        “lay the nice clean colors over your engraved bas-relief just as if you
        were painting,”<a href="#fn15"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref15"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> as well as “to apply them very
        thin and neatly, just as if you were painting in miniature.”<a

    <p>In fact, many early modern painters, such as Cellini, were trained as
        goldsmiths. Vasari in his <em>Lives</em>, lavished praise on the
        spectacular enamelling craftsmanship of Antonio del Pollaiuolo
        (1429/33–1498), who is now predominantly associated with painting.
        According to Vasari, Pollaiuolo executed “some very beautiful paxes in
        San Giovanni, which were so colored in the fire, that they could
        scarcely be done better with the brush,” “but many of his works, [...]
        because of the city’s needs in times of war, have been destroyed and
        melted in the fire.”<a href="#fn17"
           class="footnote-ref"

    <p>By conceptualizing reverse painting on glass in terms of
        <em>basse-taille</em> enamel, and <em>basse-taille</em> enamelling as a
        type of painting, we were better able to understand the procedures and
        intended effect of the recipe on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/39v/f/39v/tl"><u>39v</u></a>.
        The processes of preparing a metal surface, engraving it, and then
        applying a solid coloring substance can all find parallels in the making

    <p>Another connection between <em>basse-taille</em> enamel and reverse
        painting on glass is the shimmering and lustrous effect they both
        produce. <em>Basse-taille</em> enamel was also called translucent enamel
        (<em>emaux translucides</em>).<a href="#fn18"

        can be seen through a layer of enamel. Subtle tones and shading can be
        produced by varying the depth of the engraving. Translucency was a much
        prized quality in enamels. Cellini mentioned a kind of transparent red
        enamel (<em>rouge clair</em>) as the “most beautiful of all,” while
        another non-transparent red enamel “has not the splendid color.”<a

    <p>Interestingly, the author-practitioner also used the term “<em>rouge
            clair</em>” when he provided a recipe on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/6r/f/6r/tl"><u>6r</u></a>
        for making a turpentine-based red lake varnish that could be glazed onto
        a gilded wood panel. This suggests once more the association of
        enamelling and painting noted above. This connection involving shared
        effects across a variety of techniques and materials may also apply to
        the author-practitioner’s imitation gem-making.</p>
    <p>The same type of red lake varnish was also used as coloring for <em>verre
            églomisé</em>, as mentioned in the recipe on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/39v/f/39v/tl"><u>39v</u></a>,
        which states, “fill the background with azur d’esmail or verdigris or
        fine laque platte<a href="#fn22"

        mixed with a little of tear of mastic if you want that the colors are
        more even &amp; do not spread.” We made a red lake paint based on the
        instructions on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/6r/f/6r/tl"><u>6r</u></a>,
        first mixing ground madder lake with walnut oil, to which we then added
        turpentine varnish. Next we applied the color according to the
        procedures on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/40v/f/40v/tl"><u>40v</u></a>:
        “When you apply your turpentine colors to your glass panes, first place
        them on a hot tile &amp;, once they are hot, spread your colors &amp;
        leave it a while on the tile.” The result obtained is a translucent and
        lustrous red color, similar to clear red enamel (<i><u>Fig. 5</u></i>).
        We also put a tin sheet behind the glass pane and viewed it from the
        front side. Indeed, as the recipe said, the tin sheet “gives light to
        the colors” (<i><u>Fig. 6</u></i>). The red color appears much more
        intense and warmer with than without the tin sheet as backing (<i><u>Fig. 7</u></i>).<a href="#fn23"

    <p>A case study concerning two reliquaries, one made with <em>verre
            eglomisé</em> and the other with the <em>basse-taille</em>
        enamelling technique, can offer insight into the fluid boundaries
        between <em>basse-taille</em> enamel and <em>verre églomisé</em>, as
        well as between goldsmiths’ work and painting. A Sienese reliquary frame
        (1347) in the Cleveland Museum of Art (<i><u>Fig. 8</u></i>) that
        originally enclosed a panel depicting the Virgin and Child enthroned,
        which is now at the Fitzwilliam Museum (<i><u>Fig. 9</u></i>), is an
        outstanding example of the application of the <em>verre eglomisé</em>
        technique. The frame itself has four <em>verre eglomisé</em> heraldic
        panels (<i><u>Fig. 10</u></i>) which identify the patron as Mino di Cino
        of the aristocratic Sienese Cinughi family and the location to which it
        once belonged—the Ospedale di Sta. Maria della Scala, Siena’s foremost
        hospital. As Dillian Gordon has shown, the shape, design, and
        iconography of the central <em>verre eglomisé</em> panel all have
        equivalents in local traditions of panel painting. The unusually tall,
        slender format of the glass panel finds equivalents in works by Bernardo
        Daddi and his workshop.<a href="#fn24"

        panel has been attributed to the Sienese artist Lucas di Vieri, brother
        of the accomplished Sienese goldsmith and enameler Ugolino di Vieri. The
        most notable work of Ugolino di Vieri is the <em>Reliquary of the Santo
            Corporale</em> (1337–1338) in the Duomo of Orvieto (<i><u>Fig. 11</u></i>), one of the largest reliquaries ever commissioned
        from Siena. The eight <em>basse-taille</em> enamels in the upper and
        middle registers of the shutters on the front depict the Miracle of
        Bolsena, and the four enamels on the front and the twelve enamels on the
        back depict scenes from the Passion (<i><u>Fig. 12</u></i>). Those
        around the base depict scenes from the early life of Christ. The
        structures of these two reliquaries bear great resemblance to one
        another. They both feature a rectangular base with convex corners,
        finials, and buttressing, and they also share similar decorative
        elements, such as the acanthus leaf borders and receding tiled floors.<a

        enamelling circulated between the workshops of the two brothers, who
        perhaps worked for a time in the same workshop, which would have
        facilitated the translation of visual idioms from one technique into

    <p>It has been suggested that Lucas di Vieri tried to achieve a simulation
        of precious metalwork with cheaper materials through the <em>verre
            eglomisé</em> technique.<a href="#fn27"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref27"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a> However, this does not
        necessarily mean that <em>verre eglomisé</em> was valued less. The
        incredibly fine skills the technique requires and the splendid visual
        effect of the final product were highly praised in early modern Europe.
        Cennini, in the opening passages of the recipe concerning the <em>verre
            eglomisé</em> technique, wrote it was “beautiful, refined, and rare
        as it is possible.”<a href="#fn28"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref28"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
    <p>Interestingly, at the end of the entry describing the process on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/39v/f/39v/tl"><u>39v</u></a>,
        the author-practitioner seems to harbor the same sense, as he explicitly
        states the aim of creating something “without being at all expert in
        painting.” He even suggests that the practitioner of this art might want
        to “hide [the] secret” by covering it with tin leaf that also doubles as
        a reflective background. He thus seems to view this process as a kind of
        shortcut or trick—a secret—that a practitioner might want to keep to
        himself. Whether it was for reasons of portraying himself as more
        skilled than he is, or as a time-saving device, we cannot know. However,
        the process described in this entry seems to have been common practice
        among glass painters (<i><u>Fig. 13</u></i> and <i><u>Fig. 14</u></i>).
        The practitioner requires hardly any expertise in painting because the
        colors need only to be crudely blocked out, and the gold leaf can be
        applied as entire sheets without careful shaping (<i><u>Fig. 15</u></i>). The special skill of the practitioner consists not in those aspects
        of the process, but instead in scraping off the gold leaf to create the
        painted “history,” or narrative of the piece. The author-practitioner
        collected other processes that imitated more labor- or cost-intensive
        practices—for imitation marble, imitation <em>rouge clair</em>, and
        imitation gold leaf—and it would appear that such imitative processes
        resulting in an impressive effect or a verisimilitude of a more precious
        material were, perhaps paradoxically, especially valuable in his
        estimation.</p>

    <p>Towards the end of the fifteenth century and continuing through the
        sixteenth, thus contemporaneous with the compilation of Ms. Fr. 640,
        <em>verre églomisé</em> grew increasingly popular in the making of
        pendants. Paintings on glass in the style of <em>verre églomisé</em>,
        usually portraying religious scenes, were set into precious metal
        pendants and served as private devotional objects (<i><u>Fig. 16</u></i>). In the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, the heyday of
        <em>basse-taille</em> enamel, many pendants were instead executed in the
        <em>basse-taille</em> technique. The popularity of employing <em>verre
            églomisé</em> to make pendants in the later period further enhances
        the links between this technique and goldsmiths’ work, in particular
        with regard to gemstones. In many of their works, goldsmiths placed
        circular <em>verre églomisé</em> glass side by side with gemstones. A
        reliquary cross (<i><u>Fig. 17</u></i>) in the Victoria and Albert
        Museum is adorned with precious gemstones around a scene of the
        Crucifixion in <em>verre eglomisé</em>. The shape, color, and texture of
        the <em>verre eglomisé</em> all show great similitude to the gemstones
        set around it. Another example can be found in a painting depicting the
        Virgin and Child at the Metropolitan Museum of Art by Paolo di Giovanni
        Fei (<i><u>Fig. 18</u></i>), which has retained its original
        fourteenth-century frame. The gilded frame is decorated with gemstones
        as well as <em>verre églomisé</em> medallions depicting the
        Annunciation, saints, and Christ. A recipe on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/40v/f/40v/tl"><u>40v</u></a>
        brings together <em>verre églomisé</em>, enamel, and gemstones. In this
        recipe, the author-practitioner discusses the “Cross of the commanders
        of Malta.” <em>Rouge clair</em> pigment (not enamel) is first painted on
        silver leaf, just as in making <em>verre églomisé</em>, and then covered
        with white enamel. He particularly emphasizes that the silver leaf is “a
        thicker kind,” which is used by the makers of foil backings for
        gemstones. Applying a backing is also the last step to complete
        <em>verre églomisé</em>. Although the author-practitioner did not
        explicitly mention the link between <em>verre églomisé</em> and
        gemstones, their connection is clear both in the manuscript and in
        goldsmiths’ work from the same period.</p>

    <p>The author-practitioner describes this technique as “tracing some history
        on glass,” and I have referred to it as “reverse painting on glass,”
        which associates it with techniques of painting, whereas <em>verre
            eglomisé</em> does not associate the technique with painting, nor
        with its elevated status. Instead, it relegates this technique to the
        lower status of a “decorative art.” As this essay demonstrates, however,
        by taking into consideration the language employed in a variety of
        historical sources, as well as the procedures of making and the
        appearance of the final product, we can understand this technique, like
        the <em>basse-taille</em> enamelling which it was intended to imitate,
        as painting. Both were executed by goldsmith-painters, and both were
        described as endowed with various attributes of painting. Thus we can
        conclude that there was much more to “painting” in the early modern
        period than is commonly thought today. The recipe on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/39v/f/39v/tl"><u>39v</u></a>
        reveals to us how painting and goldsmiths’ work can be understood within
        the terms, materials, and techniques of the other as well as within the
        identity and knowledge shared by painter and goldsmith.</p>

                    beaucoup pour la décoration: on la broye à l'eau, elle donne
                    une belle laque brune en y incorporant de la cendre
