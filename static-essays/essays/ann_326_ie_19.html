        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <div>
            <p>A close physical and visual examination of Ms. Fr. 640, in terms
                of codicology (material structure) and paleography
                (handwriting), can tell us much about how it was created and
                handed down to its present location, and thus allows us to
                better understand its contents. Contrary to the first impression
                it might give the reader of a smoothly coherent whole written
                from front to back cover, it is instead the result of complex
                intellectual and technical movement back and forth between
                experimenting and writing, both at the time of its composition
                and later when it became embalmed as a valuable library item,
                right down to the present day in its most recent avatar as a
                digital facsimile, edition, and translation.</p>

    <p>A close physical and visual examination of Ms. Fr. 640, in terms of
        codicology (material structure) and paleography (handwriting), can tell
        us much about how it was created and handed down to its present
        location, and thus allows us to better understand its contents. Contrary
        to the first impression it might give the reader—especially when leafing
        through it in digital form—of a smoothly coherent whole written from
        front to back cover, it is instead the result of complex intellectual
        and technical movement back and forth between experimenting and writing,
        both at the time of its composition and later when it became embalmed as
        a valuable library item, right down to the present day in its most
        recent avatar as a digital facsimile, edition, and translation. By
        examining it from the outside to the inside, we can attempt to turn back
        the clock, as in an archeological excavation, in order to understand the
        gradual development of the volume as we now know it. Beyond that, the
        object must be envisaged as the material embodiment of intentions that,
        as usual in any kind of research (or more widely in human experience),
        may have unfolded in ways that were far from linear, and therefore can
        be difficult to follow, but deserve to be retraced as far as possible
        (<i><span class="underline">Vid. 1</span></i>).</p>

    <p>The volume is currently protected by an elegant seventeenth-century red
        morocco binding, with gilt decoration in the style known as “Du Seuil”
        (framed by two sets of triple fillets, the inner frames with blank
        escutcheons at the corners), and all edges gilt. In the middle of the
        covers it bears the arms of Philippe de Béthune (1565–1649), Baron then
        Count of Selles and Charost: argent, a fess gules, in chief a label of
        three points of the second, i.e., white with a broad horizontal strip in
        red and, at the top, an indented horizontal motif, also in red. This is
        surrounded by the two collars of the royal orders (St. Michael and the
        Holy Spirit) (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 1</span></i>). The ornate
        gilt spine is inscribed with the monogram PP (Philippe-Pierre) in a
        laurel wreath, repeated in each of the seven compartments separated by
        raised bands, and with the rather uninformative title “<em>Choses
            diverses</em>” (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 2</span></i>).
        Inside the covers, the pastedowns are of marbled paper, and two entirely
        blank endleaves in seventeenth-century paper are found at both ends of
        the volume.</p>

    <p>Philippe de Béthune was the youngest brother of the famous minister of
        King Henry IV, Maximilien de Béthune, better known, from 1606, as the
        Duke of Sully. Philippe led a prestigious military career in the Wars of
        Religion, under Henry III and Henry IV. This was followed by
        administrative and diplomatic functions: appointed a member of the
        Council of State in 1599, he was sent the next day on an embassy to
        James VI of Scotland and then, more importantly, to Pope Clement VIII
        (1601–1605). During his years in Rome, he developed a special taste for
        Italian painting, with a particular interest in Caravaggio (whom he
        apparently helped out of prison in 1603), and for book collecting.
        Considered a highly accomplished and well-educated gentleman, Philippe
        was later chosen by Henry IV to be the governor of his newborn second
        son, the duke of Orléans (1607–1611). Philippe’s last mission
        (1624–1630) was once again to Rome. During his lifetime he gathered an
        impressive collection of art, books, and manuscripts, which he passed on
        to his son Hippolyte. Hippolyte (1603–1665), born in Rome and the godson
        of Pope Clement VIII, likewise a warrior and a diplomat, chose to offer
        the collection, which had grown to some 2,000 volumes in the meantime,
        to King Louis XIV in December 1662, after turning down an enormous offer
        of 300,000 <em>livres tournois</em> from that queen of collectors,
        Christina of Sweden. The “Collection de Béthune” is one of the great
        collections in the Manuscripts Department of the Bibliothèque nationale
        de France. It consists in large part of original letters and manuscripts
        of a historical and political nature, but also comprises a number of
        technical works.<a href="#fn1"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
    <p>How and when the volume Ms. Fr. 640 came into the hands of Philippe de
        Béthune remains unknown, similarly to the rest of his collection:<a
           href="#fn2"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> <em>Habent sua fata libelli</em>, and
        such an avid collector of manuscripts would have relied on a wide
        network. At least the binding can be dated with some precision. The
        paper used for the endleaves is watermarked with the arms and monogram
        of Anne of Austria, queen of France from 1615 to 1643. Philippe de
        Béthune was made a knight of the royal orders in 1619. The “tinctures”
        (colors) of his arms, as specified above and well known from other
        sources, do not follow the conventions that came into use in the late
        1630s, when a coherent hatching system was introduced for heraldic
        engravings. Instead “gules” is represented in two different ways, with
        the “fess” cross-hatched and the “label” solid. So the binding was made
        after 1619, and presumably (at any rate the engraved stamp for the arms)
        before circa 1640.</p>
    <p>Inside the cover, the manuscript shows a treatment no less typical of
        Béthune bindings (see Vid. 1). The original gatherings were cut up into
        separate leaves, which were then re-margined by gluing separate paper
        strips along all edges, before sewing them back together into quires.<a
           href="#fn3"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> This technique served at least two
        purposes: different volumes could be made the same size and thus neatly
        aligned on the collector’s bookshelves. More importantly, the binder
        could confidently trim the pages without damaging any writing,
        especially marginal notes that extended too far towards the edges (top,
        sides, and bottom). The only difficulty was that in some cases, the
        paper strips needed to cover part of the writing, just a few letters
        here and there; but this could be mostly avoided provided there were a
        few millimeters of blank space on at least one side of each edge.<a
           href="#fn4"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
    <p>Separately mounting the original pages also destroyed any evidence of the
        original codicological structure. The current gatherings are made up of
        ternions (3 bifolia = 6 leaves = 12 pages), except for the last two,
        which are binions (2 bifolia = 4 leaves = 8 pages). In each bifolium,
        both leaves probably share the paper strip at the back, which was then
        folded and used for stitching the quire together, but that is difficult
        to ascertain without breaking the binding.</p>
    <p>Not knowing whether the current structure might have disturbed the
        original sequence could be especially problematic for Ms. Fr. 640,
        considering its highly complex textual stratification (as we will see).
        There are no signs of quire signatures or catchwords, such as those
        commonly used to preserve page and quire sequence in manuscripts and
        printed books. What we do find is consistent foliation, applied twice.
        The earlier foliation starts on what is currently the third leaf,
        numbered 1 (not taking into account the two preliminary blank leaves).
        Throughout the volume these numbers are often covered, partly or
        entirely, by the paper strips, but it is impossible to decide whether
        they existed before the Béthune binding was made, or if they belong to
        an early phase of that same operation. At any rate, they are in a hand
        not found elsewhere in the manuscript and in a style common in the
        seventeenth century. The second foliation, written on top of the paper
        strips, starts on the first folio, so that it is constantly two leaves
        ahead of the earlier numbers. In this edition, reference is always made
        to the latter foliation (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 3</span></i>).
        The different foliation and the quite different content of fols. <a

                  class="underline">170v</span></a> in comparison to the rest of
        the manuscript also raises the question of whether the lists of titles,
        authors, and jotted medical recipes on these four leaves were originally
        conceptualized as belonging to the unvarying series of recipes and
        processes that make up fols. <a

                  class="underline">170r</span></a>. Perhaps the binder had
        originally thought of using what are essentially scribbled lists as
        endleaves, rather than part of the body of the work.</p>

    <p>In order to assess the original structure of the manuscript, the main
        evidence lies in the paper itself, thanks to the presence of watermarks.
        The whole manuscript consists of paper bearing a single watermark, that
        of Nicolas Lebé: a large letter B (standing for “Le Bé”) on a crowned
        escutcheon, with the name inscribed on a scroll underneath (<i><span

                  class="underline">Fig. 5</span></i>). Variants of this
        watermark are known during the period 1561–1598.<a href="#fn5"

    <p>Is it possible to tell whether the binding preserved the original page
        sequence? The best that can be done is to ascertain if the distribution
        of watermarks follows a regular pattern. Within the paper mold,
        watermarks are usually placed at a distance of ¼ of the total width of
        the sheet, so that in a regular folio volume such as Ms. Fr. 640—where a
        full sheet is folded over just once to make a bifolium—they are entirely
        visible in the middle of one leaf in two.<a href="#fn6"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
    <p>In order to gain a detailed overview of the whole volume, we first
        transformed the sequence of pages into a string of numbers,
        differentiated according to the presence or absence of a watermark. The
        string could then be tentatively broken up into equal segments,
        according to whether the quires would have contained 4, 5, or 6 bifolia
        (the most usual numbers), and shifting the boundaries of these segments
        until every watermarked leaf could be joined to an unmarked leaf: that
        is, joined symmetrically across a central line representing the central
        fold of each quire. This was done as a practical experiment with the
        participants of the first Making and Knowing Text Workshop in 2014, and
        produced an interesting result: the original quires were certainly
        quinions (5 bifolia = 10 leaves = 20 pages), but with gaps representing
        22&nbsp;leaves in total (of which possibly 4 joined = 2 bifolia) that
        had been removed from the volume at an undetermined stage. Additionally,
        the first and last quires had only three bifolia instead of five
        (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 6</span></i>).</p>

            <figcaption>Fig. 6. Possible reconstruction of the order of folios
                of Ms. Fr. 640 by Marc H. Smith. The examination of watermarks
                makes clear that when the pre-existing book, which had consisted
                of bound folios folded in the middle, was cut apart for
                re-margining, not much, if any, of the leaves were lost.

    <p>Thus, the binding does not appear to have caused any permutations, at
        least within single quires (displacing entire quires is another accident
        that can occur in binding). But one cannot tell when and why the missing
        leaves were torn or cut out. There are at least two possibilities that
        come to mind: either they were removed by the author, maybe because of
        mistakes, or the binder left them out after cutting up the original
        quires, perhaps because they were blank.</p>
    <p>Some missing leaves could be placed in more than one position within a
        given quire. Regardless, it is possible to reach a reconstruction where
        all would have been located between self-contained pages (i.e., with no
        text carried over from one page to the next), so that complete entries
        of the text could theoretically have been left out without leaving any
        noticeable traces. This is just a cautionary observation, since there is
        no further evidence to suggest any loss of text (but for one exception,
        see below). A potentially more intriguing hypothesis is that the pages
        were blank because of a non-sequential writing process: Ms. Fr.&nbsp;640
        is now a relatively solid block of writing, but still with occasional
        blanks, and it is far from impossible that it contained a number of
        totally blank leaves before the Béthune binding.</p>
    <h2 id="the-text">The Text</h2>
    <p>That leads us to the process of writing the text, and to the hands who
        wrote it: the first and last leaves, as often, are among the most
        heterogeneous elements of the volume. But once their relationship to the
        body of the work has been put into focus, they offer precious evidence
        of the circumstances in which the whole manuscript was produced. The
        contents can be briefly summarized here, just to provide a general sense
        of the textual structure.</p>

        last two lines but one stand out in a large italic hand. The rest of

        isolated notes, mainly medical and bibliographical, at the top of each
        page.</p>
    <p>The bulk of the text, from fol.&nbsp;<a

                  class="underline">3r</span></a>, is the collection of recipes,
        observations, and experiments that kept the Making and Knowing team busy
        for six years.</p>
    <p>The last page (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/170v/f/170v/tl"><span
                  class="underline">170v</span></a>), curiously, appears to be
        upside down. At the bottom, which becomes the top when flipped, we find
        three short notes on the management of lands belonging to the Ouvrier
        family in 1578–1579, namely at St. Frajou near Toulouse; the Ouvrier, as
        is discussed in the essay by Colin Debuiche and Sarah Munoz, were a
        prominent family of merchants in Toulouse.<a href="#fn7"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> These notes are followed by medical and
        bibliographical notes not too different from those on the opening pages,
        and in similar scripts.</p>
    <p>In material terms, the last page tells us that the volume was originally
        destined for another use: the author-practitioner recycled a partially
        or almost entirely blank volume used by the Ouvrier family (or one of
        their agents), which suggests he might have been connected with them.
        The bibliographical notes in a larger script at the bottom of the page,
        after two paragraphs of practical recipes, are similar to those at the
        bottom of fol.&nbsp;<a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/1r/f/1r/tl"><span
                  class="underline">1r</span></a>. This suggests a consistent
        chronological sequence: the author-practitioner used the last page
        first, then flipped the whole volume (which must already have been at
        least stitched together if not properly bound), and started compiling
        his recipes and experiments on fol.&nbsp;<a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/3r/f/3r/tl"><span
                  class="underline">3r</span></a>, where he inscribed a cross to
        indicate the beginning, as was common practice. Roughly at the same time
        he must have added a couple of largely written bibliographical notes at
        the bottom of the last leaf. Later on, this page was gradually filled in
        using a smaller script.</p>
    <p>The Ouvrier notes also offer an essential chronological endpoint: the
        author-practitioner began to use the volume not before 1579. Further
        clues to dating the composition and writing of the text may be provided
        by the date of 2 September 1581 on fol. <a

        largely cluster before or in the year 1581, indicating perhaps that at
        least this list was compiled in 1581.<a href="#fn8"

    <h2 id="scripts-and-hands">Scripts and Hands</h2>
    <p>The variety of scripts apparent on these first and last pages raises the
        question of the different hands active in the manuscript. The main
        writer (Hand A) is clearly the author-practitioner, rather than a scribe
        in his service, considering the whole process of composing the text,
        which includes laying out headings, writing in recipes, processes,
        experiments, observations, all frequently accompanied by innumerable
        corrections and additions. He uses two distinct scripts: the body text
        is written in a short round cursive rooted in French tradition, with
        essentially gothic letterforms; headings and Latin words are in a larger
        italic script. Many writers commonly alternated both scripts in the same
        manner in the late sixteenth century. The author-practitioner’s hand is
        fully competent, fast and regular, but not that of a professional
        scribe. Fols. <a

        highly cursive handwriting that defies identification (and in part
        interpretation) at first sight. But content and context suggest this is
        actually the author-practitioner himself (i.e., Hand A), albeit in
        speed-writing mode—and possibly at a later date than the rest of the
        manuscript (Hand A’ ) (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 7</span></i>).

    <h2 id="composition-of-the-manuscript">Composition of the Manuscript</h2>
    <p>Leafing through Ms. Fr.&nbsp;640, even before reading the contents, makes
        it materially obvious that this is not, and was not planned to be, a
        continuous, sequential work, written from the first page to the last. By
        combining material observations and content analysis, it is possible to
        gain some insight into the overall genesis of the manuscript, which
        largely would seem to reflect the development of the
        author-practitioner’s activity in the workshop. Nevertheless, the
        pristine state of the manuscript, with only a few small stains or
        possible traces of dirt, indicates it was hardly kept open and updated
        in the midst of molten metals and smoky furnaces. Rather, the
        author-practitioner seems to have moved back and forth between workshop
        and study: even when documenting his own experiments, he must have
        relied on his immediate memory and maybe on rough notes to write his
        entries.</p>
    <p>The pages are almost entirely filled with text: mainly in the form of
        uninterrupted entries dealing with specific topics, under explicit
        headings; but also, in many cases, with marginal additions also in the
        author-practitioner’s hand, albeit smaller and often more cursive in
        execution. Nevertheless, short blank spaces can occur between entries,
        mostly at the bottom of a page, but occasionally also at the top or in
        the middle.<a href="#fn9"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
    <p>Within single entries, there are frequent changes in handwriting (not in
        the hand): differences in the color of the ink, the cut of the quill, or
        the size and formality of writing. Usually occurring between sentences
        or at least consistent parts of sentences, such variations are typical
        of writing in successive stints, returning to the same entry with
        additional information, experiments, and afterthoughts, such as on fol.
        <a href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/10r/f/10r/tl"><span
                  class="underline">10r</span></a> or fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/125r/f/125r/tl"><span
                  class="underline">125r</span></a>. The process becomes
        particularly clear when the end of an entry collides with, or even wraps
        around, the following heading. More subtle variations occur in the
        layout, including in justification, alignment, and spacing of lines, or
        distances between headings and body text.</p>
    <p>The marginal texts, which at first sight could be considered notes to the
        main text, are in fact not functionally distinct from such addenda, and
        should rather be considered a continuation of the same process after the
        author-practitioner had run out of space at the end of an entry. Only in
        very few instances did he write in the margins when there was still
        blank space left at the end of the entry.</p>
    <p>On the whole, the standard writing process seems to have been based on
        headings followed by a paragraph plus a varying amount of blank space
        based on a rough estimate of potential addenda. The author-practitioner
        returning to the same topic in separate entries with similar headings
        represents further steps in the same workflow, on a different scale, and
        often distant from each other.</p>
    <p>A difficult question is whether variations in ink and handwriting can
        only signal different strata of writing within a page, or if they could
        be plotted onto a more general timeline, as clues to the relative dating
        of entries and pages across the volume. It is tempting to ascribe the
        neater pages to the earliest stage, and the few extremely cursive notes
        to the author-practitioner’s latest afterthoughts, with everything else
        in between much more difficult to disentangle.</p>
    <p>This leads to another problematic question, one we may never answer,
        about the scale, or the granularity, according to which the volume was
        originally planned. A degree of randomness is not inconsistent with the
        style of books of secrets, even in published form. Still, the largely
        chaotic composition of Ms. Fr. 640 seems to reflect a non-sequential
        workflow on the part of the author-practitioner, exploring many subjects
        at the same time. He may arguably have begun to discuss different topics
        on separate pages, with what at first were possibly blank pages in
        between to be filled in gradually and more or less consistently, by
        trade and/or type of material: paints, varnishes, and the art of the
        painter; molding and foundry techniques; metal processes; arms and
        artillery (their production and use); animals and plants; and medicine.
        Those perhaps initial entries, as argued in the previous paragraph, seem
        to correspond to some longer entries, or sequences of entries, which are
        frequently written in a neatly rounded hand in medium brown ink,
        especially at the beginning of the manuscript and in many places where a
        new entry begins at the top of a page. On the contrary, the end of an
        entry at the bottom of a page is often cramped, suggesting that the top
        of the following page might have been taken up by pre-existing text.</p>
    <p>Just as gradual additions to single entries led to subsequent overflow,
        the larger divisions would have inevitably grown out of control, as the
        author-practitioner continued compiling and experimenting in various
        directions, and inserting entries on different topics in all available
        blank spaces, to the extent that the initial order, if any, became
        largely blurred. Pages containing short entries on diverse topics
        sometimes show variations in handwriting typical of cumulative additions
        over time; others, conversely, can be just as diverse in content but
        homogeneous in form, suggesting the information was acquired
        simultaneously and possibly from the same source (or just copied out at
        the same time from rough notes).</p>
    <p>Finally, variations in overall density may suggest shifts in the
        author-practitioner’s interests over time: an ever-increasing interest
        in molding and casting in particular, leading him down every rabbit hole
        in search of better “sand” and more exciting objects to mold or cast
        from life, would explain the accumulation of material in the latter part
        of the volume, where the margins are largely saturated with additions,
        and single entries seem to have been continued in leapfrog mode, by
        moving to the next available blank whenever coming up against a
        pre-existing entry on a different topic.<a href="#fn10"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Exploiting the last pages to such an
        extent also confirms the volume was ready-stitched and presumably bound,
        otherwise, it would have been simple enough to add further quires to
        accommodate the additions.</p>
    <p>How the author-practitioner could find his way about his book is somewhat
        mysterious. In a few instances, impelled by lack of space to skip
        several pages while writing on a given topic, he resorted to rough
        cross-referencing, just by indicating the number of pages the reader
        should turn to find the next entry—the longest such leap being 15
        pages—or even by an approximate point in the volume, such as “towards
        the last third of this book.”<a href="#fn11"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> This also confirms that he never used
        foliation, and therefore could not have built an index, but must have
        relied entirely on his memory of the book to locate any previous
        entries.</p>
    <h2 id="publication-as-a-goal-of-the-text">Publication as a Goal of the
        Text?</h2>
    <p>How close was Ms. Fr. 640 to being transformed into an actual “book” for
        a wider audience rather than for the use or enjoyment of a single
        writer/reader? A few pages toward the end of the volume, together with
        the first and last pages, shed some light on the question.</p>
    <p>Fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/169r/f/169r/tl"><span
                  class="underline">169r</span></a> contains a summary of
        subject headings, some of which are annotated with “mis” (put) and “veu”
        (seen). This looks like a to-do list, with the annotations perhaps
        indicating whether the process of the subject heading was “put” into a
        text or “seen.” This list might have been placed here at any stage, even
        before the previous pages were written upon. In fact, it might have been
        deliberately placed at what was to be the end of the manuscript,
        followed by two potential endleaves (fols. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/169r/f/169r/tl"><span
                  class="underline">169r</span></a>–<a

                  class="underline">170v</span></a>), but these also, like many
        others, were finally filled up by the overflow of never-ending additions
        on metalwork. The list of headings could refer either to adding entries
        on various topics to Ms. Fr. 640, or to lifting those entries from the
        manuscript and transferring them to another copy, in preparation of a
        definitive compilation. The one argument in favor of the second
        hypothesis lies in the presence, at short distance, of two more passages
        that likely point to the intention of making a proper book.</p>
    <p>Two lengthy entries, on fols. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/162r/f/162r/tl"><span
                  class="underline">162r</span></a> and <a

                  class="underline">167r</span></a> bear the intriguing heading:
        <em>Pour la Boutique</em> (“For the workshop”). The first is dedicated
        to excerpts from Herodotus (pages 1–5 of the Latin translation published
        by Henri Estienne) on Greek trade and metalwork, followed by a
        metaphorical paragraph in which the author-practitioner expresses hopes
        of trading knowledge from his “boutique” in exchange for the “secrets”
        of his “benevolent readers”:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>As small peddlers lay open small wares in order to buy richer ones
            &amp; to profit more and more, so I, from a desire to learn, am
            exposing what little is in my workshop to have in receive, through a
            common commerce of letters, much rarer secrets from my benevolent
            readers (fol. <a
               href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/162r/f/162r/tl"><span
                      class="underline">162r</span></a>).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>This passage sheds crucial light on the
        second entry (<a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/166v/f/166v/tl"><span
                  class="underline">166v</span></a>–<a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/167r/f/167r/tl"><span
                  class="underline">167r</span></a>), an otherwise mysterious
        collection of largely self-justificatory expressions, which make sense
        as the author-practitioner’s advance response to anyone reproaching him
        for disclosing valuable technical and professional “secrets.” Thus the
        heading “Pour la Boutique” most plausibly points to elements gathered
        for use in what was to become the front matter of a book. The reference
        to the “benevolent reader” in particular is typical of a prefatory
        context.</p>
    <p>Moreover, the first line on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/166v/f/166v/tl"><span
                  class="underline">166v</span></a>, “Si quelque chose est obmis
        par les moissonneurs…” constitutes a direct link to fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/1r/f/1r/tl"><span
                  class="underline">1r,</span></a> where a different phrasing of
        the same expression is also found. This, together with the excerpts from
        Herodotus, strongly suggest that the vast bibliography jotted down on
        the endleaves was a reading list, a list of potential sources of
        literary material that could be exploited to enhance the literary status
        of a publication in the eyes of the benevolent reader. How far the
        author-practitioner went down that road will remain unknown, but his
        notes on Herodotus, which reveal an insecure command of Latin and
        proceed no further than page 5, raises the suspicion that he had carved
        out for himself more than he could manage.</p>
    <p>As to the use of <em>La Boutique</em>, representing a place where goods
        are both produced and marketed, it perhaps was the title the
        author-practitioner had in mind for his prospective book. He even uses
        it in direct juxtaposition with another famous title, by favorably
        comparing his <em>Boutique</em>, which deals with practical activities
        of all sorts, to the <em>Tabula Cebetis</em>, a classic work on
        contemplative life from the 1st or 2nd century B.C., mentioned offhand
        as an apology for idlers: “Tablet of Cebes, idle, but the workshop
        represents all things active.”<a href="#fn12"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> And a fitting and original title
        <em>La Boutique</em> would have been for a book of secrets, albeit
        echoing other titles of the period that made metaphorical and humorous
        use of archetypical places—it brings to mind the successful works
        published in the 1580s by Tommaso Garzoni (1549–1589): <em>Il
            Theatro</em>…, <em>L’Hospidale</em>…, <em>La Sinagoga</em>…, and of
        course <em>La piazza universale di tutte le professioni del
            mondo</em>.<a href="#fn13"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Whether the author-practitioner gave
        up on his book, lacking the literary skills (and connections?), or died
        before he could bring his project to fruition, there is no trace of a
        book ever published under that title.</p>
