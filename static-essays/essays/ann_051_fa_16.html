        <div>
            <p>A recipe for a mixture of wax, charcoal, and sulfur referred to
                as “black sulfured wax” appears on fol. <a

                of Ms. Fr. 640. This essay contextualizes the mixture in
                relation to other wax compounds described in the manuscript and
                other craft treatises. Reconstructions of the black sulfured
                compound and two other wax variants were used to test the
                author-practitioner’s claims about the physical properties and
                practical uses of black sulfured wax. Only a limited number of
                these claims could be confirmed. Further work will have to
                experiment with varying the quantities of ingredients and mixing
                temperatures. It appears that the “black sulfured wax” was both
                a variation of the practice—common among early modern
                artisans—of mixing wax with black additives, and an extension of
                the author-practitioner’s many experiments with sulfur and wax.

    <p>Like other substances that are capable of changes of state from solid to
        malleable to liquid, wax has a long history, traceable back to
        antiquity, not only as a material destined for a myriad of making
        processes, but also as a flexible metaphor.<a href="#fn1"

        and discursive versatility of wax in Ms. Fr. 640. Central to our inquiry
        is a mixture of wax, charcoal, and sulfur, which the author-practitioner
        introduces on fol. <a

        case, we focus on the use of wax as a chief ingredient for compounds.<a

        compounds in the manuscript’s entries and marginal notes. About a
        quarter of the entries that mention wax actually treat wax compounds.
        This raises the questions: what distinguishes black sulfured wax from
        wax alone and from other wax compounds? Why and how does the
        author-practitioner arrive at creating black sulfured wax? By extension,
        how does he treat wax as a material, as a term, and as an idea? Our
        method of investigation is twofold. Through a close reading of the
        entry, we contextualize black sulfured wax in relation to other wax
        compounds in the manuscript and in earlier and contemporary treatises.
        Then, through a reconstruction of the entry, we evaluate some of the
        author-practitioner’s descriptions of black sulfured wax.</p>

        Compounds in the Manuscript and Black Sulfured Wax</h2>
    <p>A text search through the manuscript affirms that wax was a commonly used
        material for early modern artisans and artists.<a href="#fn3"

        notes.<a href="#fn4"

        instructions with varying degrees of specificity. Of the remaining seven
        entries and marginal notes, two mention compounds whose ingredients are
        listed elsewhere in the manuscript. The other five refer to compounds
        whose ingredients are not listed anywhere in the manuscript; two of them
        list such wax compounds alongside other materials for creating new
        mixtures.</p>
    <p>Color is a significant aspect of wax compounds in the manuscript. In
        nineteen entries and marginal notes, wax compounds have colors in their
        names and/or include coloring ingredients. Explicitly stated by the
        author-practitioner on fol. <a

    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>Note that the author-practitioner uses the
        words “black” and “wax” in a number of configurations and with
        additional words and phrases. In two entries on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/165r/f/165r/tl"><u>165r</u></a>,
        for example, the word “black” is used as a qualifier interchangeable
        with “gray.” In a marginal note on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/150v/f/150v/tl"><u>150v</u></a>,
        by contrast, the term “black wax” appears to refer to a specific
        compound. Whereas the author-practitioner offers a quantified recipe (as
        will be discussed below) on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/139v/f/139v/tl"><u>139v</u></a>
        for “black sulfured wax”—named as such in an accompanying marginal note,
        and mentioned again on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/151r/f/151r/tl"><u>151r</u></a>—he
        does not specify the ingredients, their ratio, or the making procedures
        for other compounds. It is thus impossible to determine overlaps and to
        count exactly how many discrete compounds in addition to black sulfured
        wax are mentioned. The noun phrase “black wax” appears to refer to
        multiple material variants rather than to a singular compound.</p>
    <p>Earlier and contemporary treatises are similarly ambiguous about wax
        compounds that are described as black or have black ingredients. Cennino
        Cennini (late 1390s) mentions a mixture of wax and “ship pitch” for
        modeling on a wall.<a href="#fn10"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref10"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> Vannoccio Biringuccio (1540)
        refers to a composition of wax and “Greek pitch or ship’s tar” for
        modeling a three-dimensional object rather than a relief.<a href="#fn11"

           role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> Hugh Plat (1653) lists “yellow

           role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> By contrast, Benvenuto Cellini
        (1568) mentions “black wax” three times in his treatises but does not
        explain what it consists of. His black wax has three different uses: a
        work surface, a molding material, and an imprinting material.<a
           href="#fn14"

           id="fnref14"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
    <p>These examples allow a modest conclusion: mixing wax with a black
        substance is a practice common among artisans.<a href="#fn15"

           id="fnref15"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> Adding color, however, is where
        the commonality ends. Just as the additive can vary from powdered
        charcoal to viscoelastic ship pitch, the mechanical behavior and use of
        the final product range from soft modeling material to hard casting
        material. The variability of black wax in the comparative sources thus
        corresponds to the multiple and ambiguous occurrences of “black wax” in
        the manuscript. It follows that “black wax” may not even refer to a
        specific set of variations but an idea that can be materialized into
        additional permutations through experimentation.<a href="#fn16"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref16"

    <p>Black sulfured wax constitutes a particular embodiment of this idea. Fol.
        <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/139v/f/139v/tl"><u>139v</u></a>
        is unusual because it not only lists ingredients for black sulfured wax
        but also offers a mixing ratio. The author-practitioner recommends half
        the amount of powdered charcoal to wax. He then instructs using as much
        sulfur as a large walnut for each full eared-porringer of melted wax.
        While neither a walnut nor an eared-porringer can be considered
        standardized volumetric measures, this specificity is unique among all
        wax compound entries in the manuscript. The ratio allows the amount of
        the ingredients to be scaled according to need.</p>
    <p>That the name <em>cire noire soufrée</em> is given in a marginal note
        also distinguishes black sulfured wax from other wax compounds, for
        which names are either given as headings to entries or not at all. If we
        accept that marginal notes are a form of addendum, it follows that the
        naming of black sulfured wax took place retroactively, after the
        author-practitioner began writing instructions for making the compound.
        Indeed, he appears to have changed his mind in the process of writing
        fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/139v/f/139v/tl"><u>139v</u></a>.
        Although the heading “Cast of wax to represent an animal that one has
        not got” suggests that he would focus on casting, nearly half of the
        subsequent text (thirty of the total seventy lines) consists of
        instructions for making black sulfured wax and descriptions of its
        physical properties. The naming of the compound in the first marginal
        note (almost aligned with the first line of the main text) thus
        indicates a momentary transition of his focus and interest towards
        defining this particular compound or perhaps claiming his intellectual
        ownership over it. It may capture the moment at which the idea of black
        wax is materialized into the variant form of black sulfured wax, a
        compound not found in any earlier or contemporary treatises that we have
        consulted so far.</p>
    <p>In addition, the name “black sulfured wax” is notable for the use of the
        word <em>soufree</em>. Although both charcoal and sulfur are additives,
        the name invokes only the latter. Moreover, the participial adjective
        “sulfured” adds a causal sense: black sulfured wax is black wax treated
        with sulfur.<a href="#fn17"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref17"

        the manuscript, some of which discuss it as a casting material.<a

        letting the sulfur settle. The process leaves “mixes only its [i.e., the

        malleable, melts more easily, and does not produce bubbles when cast. On

        in the continuation of an entry, titled “Molded waxes,” the
        author-practitioner again describes adding sulfur (now molten) to liquid
        wax and letting the sulfur settle, thereby leaving “its quality” in the
        wax. These two examples focus on the use of wax after its contact with
        sulfur. By contrast, a marginal note on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/140v/f/140v/tl"><u>140v</u></a>,
        titled “For casting in sulfur,” suggests trying “sulfur passed through
        melted wax.” Presumably referring to the same process of adding sulfur
        to wax, the statement now presents the post-contact sulfur as a casting
        material.<a href="#fn19"

    <p>Such comparative examples offer further insights into understanding black
        sulfured wax. In all three, the author-practitioner acknowledges that
        sulfur, whether in solid form or liquid form, does not fully dissolve
        but imparts some other property to the wax. Based on this understanding,
        he suggests separate uses for the two materials in their altered states
        after contact. By contrast, his instructions for making black sulfured
        wax include continuously stirring sulfur when adding it to wax so as not
        to let it settle. He thus explores three different ways of handling
        sulfur and wax: letting sulfur pass through wax and using the wax;
        letting sulfur pass through wax and using the sulfur; agitating the two
        together until the mixture solidifies so as to keep sulfur suspended in
        wax. Black sulfured wax, in other words, is an extension of his
        experiments with sulfur and wax.<a href="#fn20"

        different trajectories of experimentation: one of exploring sulfur and

        sulfur in the manuscript metonymically stands for the process of

        The practice of bleaching beeswax can be traced back to antiquity. Pliny
        the Elder in <em>Natural History</em>, for example, explains the process
        of producing Punic wax, for which beeswax was repeatedly boiled in

    <p>The term charbon most likely refers to wood-based charcoal rather than
        coal. While the entry in Randall Cotgrave’s <em>A Dictionarie of the
            French and English Tongues</em> (1611) suggests that the term was
        used interchangeably to mean both materials, Jean Nicot’s <em>Thresor de
            la langue francoyse</em> (1606) and the first edition of the
        <em>Dictionnaire de l’Académie française</em> (1694) indicate that
        charbon refers primarily to charcoal. The etymology of the term in the
        modern <em>Grand Robert</em> confirms this. Also notable is
        Biringuccio’s discussion of wood-based charcoal used for metalwork.<a

        used in the medieval period and continues to be produced today. Among
        the few extant sixteenth-century porringers that we found in museum
        collections, we chose an eared English example at the Victoria and

        melt wax and sulfur separately, combine them together, and then add
        powdered sulfur while continuously stirring the mixture. We then
        simulated two practical applications using the resulting material,
        molding and coating, each based on descriptions in the manuscript. We
        poured the molten material into two molds (each with four cavities)—the
        same silicone molds used by Landsman and Rowen in their experiments—and
        also poured it over a small piece of copper foil (approximately 4 x 4
        cm) to test the author-practitioner’s observation that this wax can be
        used to coat an engraving plate (fol. <a

        Once the black sulfured wax set, we tested its physical properties by
        manipulating it at room temperature and by melting it. We prepared two
        additional materials to compare with the black sulfured wax: wax with no
        additives and a compound that we refer to as “sulfur-passed wax.” The
        latter is based on the author-practitioner’s instructions on fols. <a

        to add sulfur to wax and let it settle. Given that the
        author-practitioner does not specify the quantity of ingredients, we
        appropriated the ratio between wax and sulfur used for black sulfured
        wax but omitted the charcoal (i.e., 98.0 g of wax to 10.7 g of sulfur).
    </p>
    <p>The different preparation procedures made it easy to anticipate how the
        three materials would look when ready to be applied. Black sulfured wax
        took on the color of charcoal, whereas wax with no additives and
        sulfur-passed wax showed no notable difference in color. Because it
        contained a proportionally large amount of charcoal powder, black
        sulfured wax turned out thicker than molten wax with no additives. Since
        we did not stir sulfur-passed wax (to keep sulfur separated from wax),
        we could not check its consistency in the heating vessel to compare to
        that of wax with no additives.</p>
    <p>Pouring into molds brought out differences among the three materials. Wax
        with no additives flowed most freely, and it was easy to maintain a thin
        stream when pouring into each mold cavity (<i><u>Fig. 2</u></i>).</p>

    <p>Sulfur-passed wax was more viscous. Observation, controllability of the
        pouring action, and the hand-feel through the heating vessel reminded us
        of light cream (<i><u>Fig. 3</u></i>). Black sulfured wax was the least
        runny. We could not pour the material in a consistent stream; it kept

    <p>During the application phase, we noted further differences among the
        three materials. In each case, we filled the material just above the rim
        of each mold cavity, to the point where the surface tension prevented
        the material from overflowing. As wax with no additives hardened, the
        exposed surface contracted and eventually formed a slightly concave
        surface with sharper edges. Sulfur-passed wax and black sulfured wax, by
        contrast, maintained the convex surface (<i><u>Fig. 5</u></i>). We also
        noticed that, because of its thickness, black sulfured wax did not reach
        some of the narrower parts of the cavity (<i><u>Fig. 6</u></i>). Pouring
        over sheets of copper foil confirmed the relative viscosity of the three
        materials observed when casting into molds. Wax with no additives
        covered the copper evenly and thinly upon application. The other two
        materials were harder to pour, as each stream hardened almost as soon as
        it hit the copper surface.</p>

    <p>The differences enumerated above were in part due to the respective
        temperatures of the three materials at the moment of application.
        Because of the quantity, preparation procedure and safety protocols,
        sulfur-passed wax and black sulfured wax cooled down in the heating
        vessel before pouring began. By contrast, we poured wax with no
        additives straight from the hot plate with no cooling period. Further
        experiments will have to test the application of the materials at the
        same temperature to keep this variable consistent. Another factor to
        consider is the method of applying each material to the sheets of copper
        foil. Dipping copper foil into the material may produce different
        results from pouring over copper.</p>
    <p>Once the materials set in the molds and on the copper foil, we
        manipulated them at room temperature. With the cast pieces, we tried
        cutting, marking, and carving with four different wax carving tools
        (<i><u>Fig. 7</u></i>). We also rubbed the cast pieces on a sheet of
        textured paper. With the copper foil, we made marks that we deemed
        common to engraving: a straight line, a curved line, an angled closed
        form, a rounded closed form, and crosshatches. Compared to the wax with
        no additives and the sulfur-passed wax, the black sulfured wax turned
        out to be the hardest and the most brittle. It did not cut cleanly: the
        piece broke as a knife was pushed in halfway, and the broken surfaces
        looked matte and textured (<i><u>Fig. 8</u></i>). Carving and inscribing
        were also difficult, as it resisted the tool and hand, and it produced
        irregular flakes (<i><u>Fig. 9)</u></i>. Black sulfured wax rubbed off
        easily on textured paper, reminding us of a crayon (<i><u>Fig.
                10</u></i>).</p>

        re-melting black sulfured wax. The first attempt consisted of melting
        the leftover compound that had hardened in the heating vessel after the

        melt the compound completely, and we discovered chunks of sulfur that
        had solidified at the bottom of the heating vessel (<i><u>Fig.

                the heating vessel, we discovered solid pieces of sulfur. The
                pieces had registered the contours of the heating vessel; we
                concluded that sulfur had sunk to the bottom of the vessel and

    <p>The second attempt consisted of melting the same leftover compound—minus
        the sulfur pieces we took out during the first attempt—at a higher
        temperature. It eventually melted into very thick liquid, which we
        poured into silicone molds and onto a ceramic plate. To our surprise,
        the melted and recast compound behaved differently. The cast pieces
        (<i><u>Fig. 12)</u></i> registered the details of the mold cavity more
        clearly than the original black sulfured wax. Their surface was smoother
        and more lustrous. Even the carving and inscribing tests brought out
        differences: although not as supple as wax with no additives or
        sulfur-passed wax, the melted and recast compound was less brittle and
        more yielding to tools.</p>

    <p>For the third attempt, we melted cast pieces of the original black
        sulfured wax, putting each relief piece face-up at the bottom of the
        heating vessel. We did not agitate the heating vessel. The pieces
        predictably melted from the bottom up (<i><u>Vid. 1</u></i>). The relief
        surface resisted the heat for 5 minutes, longer then we had anticipated
        from the small size of the cast pieces. Furthermore, the pieces
        ultimately disintegrated rather than melted—forming a crust at the
        bottom of the vessel—while retaining a vague outline of the relief
        (<i><u>Fig. 13</u></i>). In other words, towards the relief surface the
        compound had more charcoal and sulfur than wax. Given that the pieces
        were cast with the relief surface facing down, we concluded that
        charcoal and sulfur settled as soon as the compound was cast. The
        conclusion went hand-in-hand with the author-practitioner’s
        recommendation on fol. <a

    <p>Of the author-practitioner’s statements about black sulfured wax that we
        assessed, we could confirm only a few as explained above. Our black
        sulfured wax behaved differently from other descriptions on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/139v/f/139v/tl"><u>139v</u></a>.
        For example, cast black sulfured wax was not “very soft &amp; amiable
        &amp; pliant as copper;” it was much harder and more brittle than the
        cast pieces in the two comparative materials. Likewise, our melting
        attempts contradicted the author-practitioner’s explanation that black
        sulfured wax would “by means of sulfur, melts with very little heat, and
        exits without leaving any filth” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/139v/f/139v/tl"><u>139v</u></a>).
    </p>
    <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Our preparation, applications, and evaluation of black sulfured wax left
        us with more questions than answers. Two observations defied our
        expectations: the compound did not register minute details of the mold
        when cast, and it was not easy to manipulate at room temperature. Given
        that the author-practitioner recommends black sulfured wax for casting
        and modeling, it was surprising that our compound did not perform these
        primary functions. The structure of our experiments may have contributed
        to these results. Our preparation procedure kept all ingredients at the
        lowest possible temperature, perhaps causing the compound to solidify
        too quickly. It is also possible that, despite the apparent scalability
        of the author-practitioner’s ratio, there is a minimum amount
        required—perhaps as little as a large walnut-sized portion of sulfur and
        a full eared-porringer of wax—for a satisfactory result.</p>
    <p>Further experiments will have to consider these factors. Using larger
        quantities of the ingredients and mixing them at a higher temperature
        will certainly prevent the compound from cooling and hardening as
        quickly. A more extensive analysis of black sulfured wax will require
        constructing and using a plaster mold, as the author-practitioner
        devotes the rest of fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/139v/f/139v/tl"><u>139v</u></a>
        to a discussion of this specific type of mold for casting black sulfured
        wax. The plaster mold will have to be large enough to test casting the
        compound “little by little” as the author-practitioner suggests. The
        experiment should also include filling the mold excessively to observe
        overflow and reheating the mold to test whether the molten compound
        flows out without leaving residue.</p>
    <p>Despite the specificity of the author-practitioner’s instructions and
        descriptions—at least in comparison to other wax compounds—“black
        sulfured wax” as a term seldom reappears in the rest of the manuscript.
        The lack of textual recurrence, however, may be misleading. Consider the
        entry on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/150v/f/150v/tl"><u>150v</u></a>,
        “Molding hollow,” which includes the only other reference to black
        sulfured wax by its full name apart from fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/139v/f/139v/tl"><u>139v</u></a>.
        Halfway through the entry on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/150v/f/150v/tl"><u>150v</u></a>
        (where it continues onto fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/151r/f/151r/tl"><u>151r</u></a>),
        the author-practitioner mentions the compound while discussing the
        behaviors of white wax and charcoal. That he does so is significant,
        because he uses the term “wax” alone elsewhere in the entry. Read <em>in
            toto</em>, the entry refers to only one type of wax, which lines the
        inside of a mold and will eventually be melted out. In other words,
        “wax” and “black sulfured wax” are interchangeable, and the author
        invokes the latter term only to address its specific ingredients.</p>
    <p>Equally notable is the entry on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/169v/f/169v/tl"><u>169v</u></a>,
        “Reducing a round figure to a hollow form.” The author-practitioner
        refers to “black wax mixed with sulfur, as is said.” Even though he does
        not use the term “black sulfured wax,” the expression “as is said”
        (<em>comme dict</em>) allows us to conclude that he is in fact referring
        to the earlier-discussed black sulfured wax. Here again, the reference
        to the compound is used interchangeably with “wax,” which in this entry
        is used for imprinting on a relief surface.</p>
    <p>Although these are only two instances among the 108 entries and marginal
        notes that mention wax in the manuscript, they open up the possibility
        that the term “wax” without any qualifier may still refer to something
        other than a singular substance. Given the frequent mentions of casting
        or modeling with wax in the manuscript, many entries may in fact use the
        term to refer to black sulfured wax or to other wax compounds. While it
        would be impossible to determine the exact number of such cases, we may
        conclude that “wax” potentially has multiple referents. The
        author-practitioner’s use of the term as a shorthand expresses the
        material’s receptivity to further experimentation. The use of the term
        also demonstrates his understanding of wax as a fundamental material
        with inherent physical properties—of malleability, melting point, speed
        of use, and receptivity to color and mixture with other materials—that
        can be harnessed, manipulated, or augmented in compounds.</p>

                <p>Isolated this way, the expression “firmer” may connote
                    carvability, but the context does not make it certain.
                    Titled “Wax portraits,” the entry on 159r explains the
                    process of molding preexisting portraits in wax. The
                    suggestion to mix white lead to wax follows a statement
                    that, when molding a wax portrait set on wood (presumably a
                    relief wax portrait set on a wood support), one should pour
                    very hot melted wax over the wood before molding. It is thus
                    possible that firmness may have something to do with
                    creating a barrier between the wood and the molding
                    material.<a href="#fnref7"

                <p>The phrase <em>pour esbaucher</em> here is confusing, given

                <p>We may invoke Georges Didi-Huberman’s characterization of wax
                    as “the unstable material par excellence” here, in the sense
                    that the idea of black wax cannot be fixed to a specific
                    number of variations. Georges Didi-Huberman, “Wax Flesh,

                    1999), 64. In another essay, he explores the metamorphic and
                    polymorphic potential of wax in terms of “viscosity,” which
                    in French (<em>viscosité</em>) has a stronger negative
                    connotation of repulsion and repulsiveness. Thus he
                    describes wax as a material that constantly defies
                    linguistic as well as physical attempts to contain it.
