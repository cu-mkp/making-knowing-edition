        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <div>
            <p>The cursory description on fol. <a
                   href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/104v/f/104v/tl"><u>104v</u></a>
                of an automatic, mechanical version of the spinet, a
                plucked-stringed keyboard instrument, is one of a handful of
                entries on music or mechanics in Ms. Fr. 640. The
                author-practitioner likely had some familiarity with
                plucked-stringed instruments and possessed a curiosity for
                “invention,” a term he used to describe the automatic spinet and
                one with broader meaning in the sixteenth century than it has
                today. An automatic spinet would have belonged within relatively
                elite social circles, and it shares technical features with
                musical automata of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. A
                scaled-down reconstruction questions the likelihood that the
                author-practitioner ever undertook the entry’s instructions
                himself. Rather, the “Spinet” entry probably resulted from his
                interests and encounters, reminding readers that the manuscript
                should sometimes be seen as a collection of thoughts and
                observations as well as a practical guidebook.</p>

           role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> The spinet is a small, early
        modern keyboard instrument similar to the harpsichord that operates by
        the plucking of its strings, as opposed to the hammering mechanism of
        the modern piano. The author-practitioner’s brief description of an
        automatic version of this musical instrument stands out as a somewhat
        odd insertion in the overall manuscript. Mentions of the spinet feature
        in just two of the manuscript’s entries,<a href="#fn2"

           role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> This scant coverage might imply
        the author-practitioner’s limited expertise in these areas. His
        designation of this musical machine as an “invention” connotes a sense
        of novelty and originality, at least to a modern reader. Moreover, its
        designation as “your” invention raises the additional question: who is
        the inventor? This essay considers the possible reasons underlying the
        author-practitioner’s inclusion of the “Spinet” entry by assessing it
        within the internal context of the manuscript itself. Accordingly, this
        study sets fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/104v/f/104v/tl"><u>104v</u></a>
        against the wider background of music, automata, and “invention” in
        sixteenth-century Europe, and it experiments with the reconstruction of
        this self-playing spinet based on the entry’s text and accompanying
        image. The result suggests that the “Spinet” entry does not likely
        reflect extensive first-hand practice but rather arose from the
        author-practitioner’s encounters and interests.</p>
    <h2 id="context">Context</h2>
    <p>In the margin to the left of the text of “Spinet playing by itself” on
        fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/104v/f/104v/tl"><u>104v</u></a>,
        the author-practitioner offers a simple sketch of the mechanism he
        envisions for this “invention” (<i><u>Fig. 1</u></i>). The illustration
        depicts a horizontal rod or dowel encircled by a series of disc-like
        objects placed at more or less regular intervals. Each disc or “wheel”
        is unique: the one placed second to the left actually resembles
        something more akin to a ring, while the one furthest to the right
        merely comprises two perfunctory quill strokes that, when viewed on
        their own, do not necessarily give the impression of a circular or
        disc-like form. Compared to the precise visual schematic one would
        expect from a modern instruction manual, the author-practitioner’s
        illustration appears incomplete, inconsistent, and hastily drawn.</p>

    <p>The text of the recipe is similarly sketchy in nature, especially in
        comparison with many of the more detailed entries contained in the
        manuscript. Besides the mention of “quills,” no other materials are
        specified, no measurements are outlined, and no tools are suggested.
        Furthermore, the author-practitioner omits any information about his
        particular understanding of the spinet, an instrument subject to a
        number of crucial variables, such as the shape and size of the case and
        the spacing of the strings. The brief mention of the cittern, a small
        quill-plucked instrument related to the lute, verifies that he
        envisioned a plucking mechanism for his spinet contraption, but he
        neglects to elaborate on this mechanism.</p>
    <p>When examined in isolation, however, the opacity of the “Spinet playing
        by itself” entry belies the author-practitioner’s familiarity with
        contemporary musical instruments evident in the manuscript as a whole.
        Specifically, plucked-stringed instruments and their material components
        feature as tools, both literal and heuristic, in various places in Ms.
        Fr. 640. Four entries explain how harpsichord and spinet strings can be
        used to arrange and position animal specimens for casting.<a href="#fn4"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref4"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> The author-practitioner also
        invokes in a handful of entries the shape of the mandore or mandora, a
        gut-strung and quill-plucked instrument also belonging to the
        cittern/lute family, as a shape to emulate when forming clay slabs.<a
           href="#fn5"

        can be observed in early modern pictorial representations of the
        instrument, such as that of the German composer and musician Michael
        Praetorius from 1619 (<i><u>Fig. 2</u></i>). Similarly, a reference on
        <a

        to harpsichord strings also calls upon the reader to create a “cake
        shaped like a mandore” of clay for casting purposes. In addition to
        employing musical materials and metaphors for nonmusical ends, the
        author-practitioner explicitly references instrument building in three
        entries: fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/98r/f/98r/tl"><u>98r</u></a>

    <p>The collective presence in the manuscript of plucked-stringed
        instruments—spinets, harpsichords, the cittern, mandores, lutes, and
        guitars—mirrors the particular artisanal world of instrument builders in
        sixteenth-century France. The French construction of keyboard
        instruments during this time mostly focused on the production of spinets
        rather than their larger cousin, the harpsichord.<a href="#fn7"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref7"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> None of these French examples
        have survived, but based on extant illustrations, the majority of these
        instruments seem to have been constructed with a rectangular case, in
        contrast to the polygonal spinets frequently crafted elsewhere in Europe
        around the same time.<a href="#fn8"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref8"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> For example, one Venetian spinet
        dating from 1540 exhibits a pentagonal construction (<i><u>Fig. 3</u></i>), while an image published by the French music theorist Marin
        Mersenne in 1636 displays the rectangular shape evidently typical of
        French craftsmanship (<i><u>Fig. 4</u></i>). However, though spinet
        making appears to have coalesced around certain manufacturing
        conventions in sixteenth-century France, the builders of such spinets in
        fact participated in the construction of a wide ambit of
        plucked-stringed instruments. This is evidenced by inventories of the
        workshops of Parisian <em>épinettiers</em> compiled from the mid to late
        sixteenth century. One such inventory dating from 1556 lists spinets and
        clavichords as well as viols and a cittern, while that of another
        <em>épinettier</em> in 1587 registers more lutes, violins, mandores, and
        other plucked-stringed instruments than keyboard instruments.<a

    <p>While the plucked-stringed instruments mentioned in the manuscript shared
        similar origins of production, the extent of their social distribution
        in sixteenth-century France is less clear, though it appears that most
        such instruments possessed links to elite and upper-middling culture.<a

        late sixteenth century.<a href="#fn14"

    <p>The “Spinet playing by itself” entry also reflects a lively interest in
        automatic instruments and automata more generally in the early modern
        period, though the exact nature of the author-practitioner’s personal
        familiarity with automata is difficult to determine. During the late
        Middle Ages and the Renaissance, the Catholic Church commissioned
        self-moving mechanical figures and objects to adorn the clocks and
        organs of cathedrals, and automata similarly featured on municipal town
        clocks in various European cities.<a href="#fn16"

        hydraulic-powered automata had become common features on aristocratic
        estates throughout much of Europe. The French essayist Michel de

        during his tours of noble gardens from 1580 to 1581.<a href="#fn18"

        to a clockwork mechanism and a rotating axle “programmed” with
        protruding pins (in this case, feather quills) certainly bear some
        resemblance to contemporary mechanical-musical technologies. In the late
        fifteenth century, Leonardo da Vinci produced a series of detailed plans
        for his famously complicated <em>viola organista</em>, a type of
        keyboard instrument that adapted technological elements from the
        hurdy-gurdy. The hurdy-gurdy, or <em>vielle</em>, is operated by
        cranking a metal shaft that rotates a rosined wooden wheel to vibrate a
        set of strings with friction (<i><u>Fig. 5</u></i>). Often considered
        the instrument of beggars, the hurdy-gurdy was common in
        sixteenth-century France and may have helped inspire the rotating
        axle-wheel mechanism described by the author-practitioner.<a

    <p>The author-practitioner deemed a “spinet playing by itself” worthy of
        being labeled an “invention” in spite of its evident affinities with
        musical automata of the fifteenth through the seventeenth centuries.
        Contemporaneous writings reveal a wider early modern preoccupation with
        the idea of “invention.” The French ceramicist Bernard Palissy appears
        in a list of books and authors on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/1r/f/1r/tl"><u>1r</u></a>
        in the manuscript, as “inventor of rustic figurines,” a designation
        which was featured on the title page of his <em>Discours admirables</em>
        published in 1580. The list of books in Ms. Fr. 640 also references a
        late sixteenth-century commercial handbook of <em>nova inventione</em>
        from Italy (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/2v/f/2v/tl"><u>2v</u></a>)
        as well as a work entitled <em>Nouvelles inventions pour bien bastir et
            à petits fraiz</em> by the French architect Philibert de l’Orme
        (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/170v/f/170v/tl"><u>170v</u></a>).
    </p>
    <p>The meaning of “invention” in the early modern period, however, was more
        elastic and capacious than what is connoted by the modern concepts of
        “individual genius” and “innovation.” It is true that the fifteenth and
        sixteenth centuries had already witnessed the coupling of invention with
        notions of individual authorship and innovation, which provided
        conceptual foundations for the development of intellectual property and
        patent systems.<a href="#fn27"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref27"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a> However, these associations, and
        the idea of invention as technological novelty more specifically, only
        gradually rose to prominence during the seventeenth century. Thus, in
        centuries prior, “invention” carried a greater variety of cultural
        significations.<a href="#fn28"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref28"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a> The Italian scholar Polydore
        Vergil (ca. 1470–1555), who is included in the list of books on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/2r/f/2r/tl"><u>2r</u></a>,
        demonstrated this fluid notion of invention in his <em>De inventoribus
            rerum</em>. Rather than compiling the technological innovations of
        his time, this work instead concerned itself with pinpointing the
        origins of traditions and inventions among the ancients, especially the
        founding of religious customs and sects. Polydore used the Latin verb
        <em>invenire</em> in a flexible manner, meaning both to create or devise
        but also to find or literally “come upon” something already in
        existence.<a href="#fn29"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref29"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a> Thus, when discussing the Greek
        origins of musical instruments, for example, he relates Pliny’s opinion
        that Mercury had “invented” piped wind instruments, while Amphion was
        the “discoverer” of the lyre.<a href="#fn30"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref30"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a> Such multivalent formulations of
        the idea of invention were widespread. In the realm of sixteenth-century
        poetry and rhetoric, French writers often portrayed literary invention
        both as an act of “finding” as well as one of selective arranging and
        creating out of already extant literary material.<a href="#fn31"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref31"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a> Even as late as the early
        seventeenth century, Dutch thinkers frequently viewed the practices of
        imitation and invention as inextricably linked within a continuous
        process, and individuals characterized as “inventors” often preoccupied
        themselves with the recovery of “lost” knowledge and the inventions of
        antiquity as much as producing new creations of their own.<a

    <p>Accordingly, the author-practitioner marshals the concept of invention in
        a diverse manner in the manuscript, raising questions concerning how one
        should interpret his choice to apply this label to his description of
        the automatic spinet. On the one hand, in a section entitled “For the
        workshop” on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/166r/f/166r/tl"><u>166r</u></a>,
        the author-practitioner questions the very idea of novel invention.<a
           href="#fn33"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref33"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a> Responding to “jealous” artisans
        who may take issue with the appropriation of their knowledge, the
        author-practitioner exhorts his readers to dispel the notion that they
        “are able to invent anything new,” and to recognize instead that one
        must strive to “rediscover” that which was already known in antiquity,
        thereby reflecting the humanistic ethos of his time. On the other hand,
        elsewhere in the manuscript, he readily claims ownership over his “own
        invention” of the use of grains of yellow millet, amaranth, or rapeseed
        as replacement eyes in the molding of animals (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/144r/f/144r/tl"><u>144r</u></a>,
        “Turtles,” and marginal note). Most often, however, the instances of
        “invention” in the manuscript variably refer to the generation or
        discovery of technologies, techniques, and material usages by other
        craftsmen rather than the author-practitioner himself. Fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/21r/f/21r/tl"><u>21r</u></a>
        (“For firing a cannon at night”) and a marginal note on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/17r/f/17r/tl"><u>17r</u></a>
        mention technological innovations that “others” have developed for
        operating cannons. The “Glassworker” entries on fols. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/37v/f/37v/tl"><u>37v</u></a>
        and <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/32v/f/32v/tl"><u>32v</u></a>
        respectively describe the practices of “those who discovered the
        invention of working in small works of soft enamels” and glassworkers’
        apparent lack of the “invention” of a “perfect red.” A marginal note on
        fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/120r/f/120r/tl"><u>120r</u></a>
        relates of the “invention of <em>crocum</em>,” or <em>crocum ferri</em>,
        a material which facilitates the casting of flowers in gold in addition
        to silver, that “it has not been forty years that one knows this in
        Germany.” Citing Herodotus, the author-practitioner even discusses who
        should be given credit for the invention of deep-sea navigation on fol.
        <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/162r/f/162r/tl"><u>162r</u></a>.
        No indication is given as to the provenance of the “beautiful invention”
        of grinding stone alum for use as a binding agent in sand (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/108v/f/108v/tl"><u>108v</u></a>,
        marginal note). Thus, given this term’s varied treatment in the
        manuscript, the status of the “spinet playing by itself” as an
        “invention” remains open to question. The author-practitioner may have
        viewed this musical machine as something uniquely novel and original, or
        perhaps as an innovation or discovery in a more general, collective
        sense.</p>
    <h2 id="reconstruction">Reconstruction</h2>
    <p>Given the ambiguity of the entry on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/104v/f/104v/tl"><u>104v</u></a>,
        any attempt at reconstructing the “spinet playing by itself” should
        necessarily be treated with caution. Thus, the following efforts should
        not be viewed as an attempt at authentic reconstruction but rather as a
        practical investigation into the author-practitioner’s possible mindset
        when he jotted down his instructions. Among the questions that this
        practical investigation set out to answer were: 1) what kinds of
        knowledge, skill, and experience would one need to actually construct
        something along the lines of the author-practitioner’s description, and
        2) how does the answer to the first question affect our reading of the
        “Spinet playing by itself” entry? What follows is a selective account of
        the reconstruction process, focusing on central issues that arose in
        this undertaking and general observations regarding procedure.<a
           href="#fn34"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref34"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
    <p>The task of reconstruction demanded various efforts to fill in the
        information gaps of the entry and the author-practitioner’s diagram. For
        simplicity’s sake, I decided to approximate a reconstruction using a
        scaled-down model. This involved creating a simple stringed instrument
        upon which the rotating axle implement would operate. I opted for three
        strings spaced one inch from one another set over a flat wooden
        baseboard, even though an actual spinet would contain many more strings
        placed very close to one another (see, again, Figs. 3 and 4). This
        decision to further sacrifice authenticity stemmed from my intuition
        that fewer strings and wide spaces between them would save time in
        construction and offer better chances of producing a functioning
        mechanism.</p>
    <p>Regarding materials, I had to make a number of informed if ultimately
        rather arbitrary decisions. Wood is one common denominator between the
        musical instruments referenced in the manuscript, and it is easily
        manipulated and “pierced” per the recipe’s instructions. A keyword
        search for “wood” in the English translation of the manuscript yields a
        large number of results, and one entry (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/34v/f/34v/tl"><u>34v</u></a>)
        even describes using a banded boxwood vessel that would presumably be
        crafted in a similar way to the “wheels” described in the spinet recipe.
        For these reasons, I decided to use wood for the axle and wheels, and
        specifically poplar and pine due to their availability. Regarding
        strings for the instrument, harpsichord and spinet strings were
        historically crafted from iron or brass, and thus I determined that
        modern steel guitar strings would function as a suitable, cheap
        substitute.<a href="#fn35"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref35"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>35</sup></a> Concerning the quills, crow
        quills were the norm in plucked-stringed keyboard instruments before the
        modern development of plastic plectra. However, crow quills vary by
        consistency and are more prone to breaking than plastic, and the
        handling and cutting of them for use in a keyboard instrument is a
        developed skill in its own right.<a href="#fn36"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref36"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>36</sup></a> Therefore, I decided first to
        experiment with fashioning my own plectra from rigid plastic (I used
        guitar picks) and to move on to quills if time allowed (which it did
        not). Finally, I imagined that some sort of adhesive material would be
        needed to “attach” the quills to the wooden wheels. Various types of
        glues feature throughout the manuscript, so I decided to start with
        modern wood glue and proceed to investigate more historically faithful
        types if time permitted (which, again, it did not). Likewise, in the
        interest of time, this reconstruction relied on modern power tools in
        addition to hand tools.</p>
    <p>In planning, I considered a number of possible configurations that could
        be interpreted from the author-practitioner’s words. The references to
        feathers/quills and the cittern make it reasonably clear that the
        author-practitioner envisioned the axle-wheels rotating over a spinet’s
        soundboard, enabling the quills to pluck the strings. The recipe vaguely
        states that the wheels should be pierced around their edges
        (<em>espesseur</em>) implying that this is where the plectra should be
        placed. The only efficacious design I could conceive of would position
        the plectra on the perimeter of the wheels so that they would point
        outward from the rotating axle, similar to how builders arranged the
        pins on the programmed barrels used in contemporaneous automata. I
        further reasoned that the rotating axle implement would need to be
        placed at an angle in relation to the strings (i.e., neither parallel
        nor perpendicular to them) in order for it to operate. If it were
        positioned parallel to the strings, the various plectra would only be
        able to pluck one of the strings, which would surely be insufficient for
        the type of “song” imagined by the author-practitioner. Alternatively,
        if the axle-wheel implement were placed perpendicular to the strings,
        the plectra would not be able to pluck them at all.</p>
    <p>Prior to working with the materials, I drew up a simple sketch (<i><u>Fig. 8</u></i>) of what I envisioned and composed a list of the
        components and their dimensions. Interestingly, however, the dimensions
        I first proposed ultimately shaped the final product (<i><u>Fig. 9</u></i> and <i><u>Vid. 1</u></i>) much less than I originally imagined they
        would. In fact, only one of my proposed dimensions ended up in the final
        construction, which was my initial, arbitrary decision to space the
        three strings one inch apart. The dimensions for the rest of the
        components, then, were largely determined by 1) in reference to the
        baseline dimension of one-inch spaces between the strings, 2) the nature
        of the available materials and tools, and 3) trial and error. To
        illustrate how these factors shaped my process, consider the following
        examples. In Columbia University’s MakerSpace workshop where the
        reconstruction work took place, there was a plank available for use with
        suitable dimensions (14” x 14” x 3/4”) for a baseboard. Given that I had
        already decided the strings would be spaced at one-inch intervals,
        crafting wheels with a thickness of ¾ inch would thus afford sufficient
        room between them when placed on the dowel axle, and therefore another
        available plank with a thickness of ¾ inch seemed appropriate for
        fashioning the wheels. I cut the wheels with a circular drill
        attachment, choosing a size roughly 2 inches in diameter. Next, I
        drilled holes measuring ½ inch in diameter in the center of the wheels
        for the dowel axle to pass through. However, due to my lack of
        experience with a drill press, I unfortunately drilled the holes off
        center. To remedy this, I filed and sanded the wheels until they were
        all roughly of the same size and the drilled holes were centered.</p>

    <p>Indeed, measurement by visual reference rather than by numerical metric
        proved indispensable in constructing the automatic spinet model. Almost
        invariably, gauging the dimensions of the components by comparing and
        marking them in relation to each other rather than taking a ruler to
        each and every piece offered both greater speed and accuracy. This
        approach may well be common knowledge among woodworkers and other
        craftspeople dealing in the precise construction of interlocking parts,
        but it is a method I only came upon through engaging with materials. As
        just one example of my reliance on this method of referential
        measurement, take the case of determining the required lengths of the
        plastic plectra. Having ascertained that using a straight edge to
        measure the distance between the string height and the curved surface of
        the bottom of the wheels would be difficult, I instead took a small
        wooden block with squared edges, positioned it on the baseboard flush
        with one of the taut strings and the flat edge of one of the wheels, and
        traced the outline of both the string and the edge of the wheel onto the
        block (<i><u>Fig. 10</u></i>). This gave me an accurate visual
        representation of the distance between the string height and the wheel.
        I marked this distance on a piece of paper, transferred it back to the
        block, and extended it with a straight edge squared against a flat
        surface. I could then easily use this marked block as a visual benchmark
        for marking and cutting the plastic plectra to their requisite lengths (<i><u>Fig. 11</u></i>).</p>

    <p>The process of reconstruction raised additional practical issues that I
        had not anticipated in the brainstorming and planning stages. For
        example, I had not foreseen the importance of ensuring that the
        incisions made on the perimeters of the wheels for the plectra were at
        the proper angle, namely directly toward the center of the wheel. I made
        a number of these incisions noticeably off-kilter, as one can observe by
        looking down the length of the axle and comparing the spacings of the
        tips of the plectra (<i><u>Fig. 12</u></i>). This spacing, of course,
        affects the time interval between “plucks” and thus the performance of
        the programmed song. Additionally, shortening the gap between the edge
        of the wheels and the strings, and in turn shortening the length of the
        plectra, would have achieved a more precise distribution of plectra
        tips. I also did not foresee that my dowel axle would float back and
        forth across the strings without some fixed piece on the dowel between
        the nail handle and the nearest end block (see Fig. 9).
        Thus, as currently built, one must ensure that the dowel is pushed
        completely into the block at the opposite end as one rotates it.
        Moreover, the axle and end blocks being made of untreated wood creates
        some friction and slippages when the apparatus rotates, which leads me
        to believe that treating the wood, or even better, using metal for the
        axle and end pieces, would provide smoother function. Finally, the use
        of two separate components—wheels and an axle—for the rotating implement
        proved to be slightly problematic. The fact that each wheel must be cut
        separately and arranged precisely along the axle produces occasion for
        error that could be avoided by using a continuous cylindrical object,
        which indeed appears to have been standard for contemporaneous automata.

    <h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
    <p>Despite the author-practitioner’s assurance that “your invention will be
        effected,” experimenting with reconstruction confirmed my suspicion that
        the effectiveness of the “spinet playing by itself” is in fact far from
        assured in practice. In my scaled-down version, I enjoyed numerous
        conveniences that helped me complete the project: I only dealt with
        three strings as opposed to the approximately thirty to fifty strings
        present on an early modern spinet; I spaced them far apart; I often
        relied upon modern tools and materials, which enabled swift
        construction, durability, and a high level of precision, and I used a
        spacious, blank baseboard upon which I could freely draw and test out
        different possibilities of construction. Even with these aids, numerous
        problems arose in the process of reconstruction, helping me to
        appreciate just how difficult it would be to create a full-blown version
        on the order of what the author-practitioner seems to be suggesting on
        fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/104v/f/104v/tl"><u>104v</u></a>.
        It became clear to me that such an intricate construction could only be
        carried out in a protracted process of trial and error by someone
        intensely knowledgeable about their craft. If the author-practitioner
        had in fact possessed this sort of extensive practical experience, it
        seems likely that the “spinet playing by itself” would have received
        more than just the few lines that it occupies in the manuscript.</p>
    <p>While this same conclusion could well be extrapolated from the sheer
        brevity of the “Spinet” entry, my efforts at reconstruction caused me to
        reevaluate the evidentiary basis of such a position. In particular,
        while my modern sensibilities had initially considered the absence of
        any measurements in the recipe to be a critical omission exposing a lack
        of practical foundation or incomplete instructions, my hands-on
        investigation revealed that specific measurements are simply not
        amenable to creating the “spinet playing by itself.” Not only would
        narrating step-by-step instructions and dimensions in written form for
        this project be an arduous task, but because the procedure depends
        crucially on the baseline dimensions and form of the stringed instrument
        being used (i.e., the spinet), any such specific instructions would only
        be useful if spinets had standard dimensions and features in the
        sixteenth century, which of course they did not. Rather, such a project
        would rely upon relative and referential measurement, which, as I have
        explained, I resorted to somewhat instinctively.<a href="#fn37"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref37"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>37</sup></a> Nevertheless, despite the
        impractical nature of communicating precise instructions for the
        automatic spinet, I still find the absence of other traces of practice,
        such as any elaboration on materials, tools, or procedure, to be a
        persuasive indication that the author-practitioner probably did not see
        this project to fruition.</p>
    <p>To conclude, the presence of the “Spinet” entry in the manuscript is
        probably more a manifestation of the author-practitioner’s interests and
        encounters rather than a product of laborious practice. These interests
        took inspiration from a variety of contexts. The mentions of
        plucked-stringed instruments in the manuscript indicate that the
        author-practitioner had some basic familiarity with these objects. This
        familiarity could have resulted from encounters in an instrument
        builder’s workshop, but it may also suggest some connection to the elite
        and upper-bourgeois social worlds in which these instruments were used.
        Elite social contexts also cultivated a vogue for automata in the
        author-practitioner’s day. Additionally, the author-practitioner seems
        to have been interested in invention, an idea evolving in its connection
        to notions of innovation, discovery, and ownership at the time of the
        manuscript’s composition. Practical investigation confirms that he
        likely did not attempt to realize this “invention” himself, but it also
        cautions against treating the absence of detail in the manuscript as a
        clear-cut indication of the author-practitioner’s lack of practical
        experience. Finally, this study calls further attention to the various
        functions of the author-practitioner’s document, namely the ways in
        which it should sometimes be read as an instruction manual, while at
        other times it should be seen more as a compendium of observations or a
        catalog of thoughts-in-progress.</p>

                <p>In fact, there is evidence elsewhere in the manuscript that
                    the author-practitioner had some knowledge of or experience
                    with similar approaches to measuring by reference. The

                    describes a method for using a type of hands-on geometry to
                    transfer measurements from a larger to a smaller circle
                    without doing painstaking measurement on the smaller circle.

                    explains how one can produce a perfectly symmetrical figure
