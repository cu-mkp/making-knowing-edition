        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <div>
            <p>This essay compares BnF Ms. Fr. 640 with <em>The Jewell House of
                    Art and Nature</em> (1594) by Hugh Plat. It considers
                similarities and differences between these two works and
                analyzes areas of overlap. I argue that Plat, for all his
                emphasis on experiential knowledge, probably had less personal
                experience of casting, molding, and weapons than the
                author-practitioner. I explore the local contexts and knowledge
                networks in which the texts were produced, and how the
                author-practitioner and Plat dealt with the issue of secrets in
                their works. This comparison of the two texts highlights the
                importance of experience and exchange in early modern knowledge
                networks.</p>

    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
    <p>A comparison between Hugh Plat’s 1594 book <em>The Jewell House of Art
            and Nature</em> and Ms. Fr. 640 reveals notable similarities.<a
           href="#fn1"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref1"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> While Hugh Plat lived and wrote
        in London, and the author-practitioner of Ms. Fr. 640 seems to have been
        located in Toulouse, both works consider similar topics, such as
        casting, molding, weapons, and animal husbandry. Both were written in
        early modern European cities in the late sixteenth century and were
        influenced by the urban contexts in which they were produced.</p>
    <p>Ms. Fr. 640, the author-practitioner’s unpublished manuscript, contains
        170 handwritten folios of recipes, practical instructions, and other
        tidbits of information with marginal annotations. The entries range from
        sleight of hand tricks to cures for gout and gonorrhea.<a href="#fn2"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref2"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> The contents of Ms. Fr. 640
        suggest that the author-practitioner was particularly interested in (or
        knowledgeable about) casting and molding, cultivation, and weapons,
        among other topics. The author-practitioner’s origins are uncertain.</p>
    <p>We know more about Hugh Plat. Plat was a prodigious inventor, a prolific
        writer, a capable gardener, and an avid student of philosophy and
        natural history.<a href="#fn3"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref3"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> He was baptized in London on May
        3, 1552. Plat’s father, Richard, was a brewer who made his fortune after
        moving from London to Hertfordshire.<a href="#fn4"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref4"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> As a teenager, Plat studied at
        St. John’s College, Cambridge.<a href="#fn5"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref5"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> In the 1571–72 academic year he
        was admitted to Lincoln’s Inn, an educational institution for students
        of the law. For young, upwardly mobile Londoners like Plat, Lincoln’s
        Inn provided both social and educational opportunities that would help
        to establish Plat as a respectable and scholarly gentleman.<a
           href="#fn6"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref6"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> He was called to the bar (thus
        completing his legal education) in 1581.<a href="#fn7"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref7"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
    <p>Plat also published his first book while still a student at Lincoln’s
        Inn. This book, <em>The Floures of Philosophie,</em> was a collection of
        self-authored poems and precepts drawn from the works of Seneca. His
        second book, published in 1584, drew on the works of Petrarch and the
        church fathers.<a href="#fn8"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref8"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> In the 1590s, Plat began meeting
        with Londoners from all walks of life in pursuit of the various kinds of
        knowledge they could offer him. This knowledge was usually practical but
        sometimes philosophical. The information Plat gleaned from these
        encounters became the basis for his book <em>The Jewell House</em>.</p>
    <p><em>The Jewell House</em> consists of five sections. The first section
        includes 103 “Diverse new and conceited Experiments.” Like the entries
        in Ms. Fr. 640, the entries in this section of <em>The Jewell House</em>
        are a collected assortment of observations, instructions, and pieces of
        advice. They range in topic from how “To steale bees” to “How to erect
        or build over any brooke, a cheap wooden bridge…without fastening any
        tymber work within the water.”<a href="#fn9"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref9"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> The second section of <em>The
            Jewell House</em> is a treatise on soil that includes strategies for
        the cultivation of farmland.<a href="#fn10"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref10"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> The third concerns distillation
        and the fourth focuses on casting and molding. In the fifth and final
        section of <em>The Jewell House,</em> Plat presented some “New
        Inventions” of his own design, such as an easily portable pump and a
        light raincoat that was nonetheless “sufficient against all rainie
        weather.”<a href="#fn11"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref11"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
    <p>Ms. Fr. 640 and <em>The Jewell House</em> consider similar topics, such
        as casting and molding, cultivation, animal husbandry, and weapons. Of
        the over one thousand entries in Ms. Fr. 640, over four hundred are
        concerned with casting and molding.<a href="#fn12"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref12"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> <em>The Jewell House</em>
        includes a comparable section in which Plat describes the processes of
        casting and molding in forty-four steps.<a href="#fn13"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref13"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> About thirty of the
        author-practitioner’s entries concern the cultivation of plants or how
        to capture and care for animals (for life casting).<a href="#fn14"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref14"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> Plat discusses agricultural
        cultivation in the second section of <em>The Jewell House.</em> In
        addition, twelve entries in <em>The Jewell House</em> describe how to
        capture or care for animals and insects. Fifty entries in Ms. Fr. 640
        concern weapons, compared to three entries in <em>The Jewell
            House.</em><a href="#fn15"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref15"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
    <p>For the purposes of this comparison, I systematically matched entries or
        topics that are included in both works. Using the Ms. Fr. 640 index as a
        starting point, I identified key areas of overlap and matched relevant
        parts of <em>The Jewell House</em> with corresponding entries in Ms. Fr.
        640. A document listing entries I matched can be found in the Appendix
        at the end of this essay. This annotation will focus chiefly on the
        topical overlap that I found between Ms. Fr. 640 and the sections on
        “experiments” and casting and molding in <em>The Jewell House.</em>
        These were the sections in which I found the most significant overlap
        and of which I thought in-depth comparisons with Ms. Fr. 640 would be
        most useful.</p>
    <p>Based on these comparisons, I will argue that the author-practitioner
        likely had more firsthand experiential knowledge than Plat, especially
        when it came to weaponry and processes of casting and molding. I will
        consider how Ms. Fr. 640 and <em>The Jewell House</em> were both shaped
        by the knowledge networks in which their respective authors operated.
        Both Plat and the author-practitioner appear to have been interested in
        the exchange of knowledge and secrets for personal gain, but the
        differing potential repercussions of publishing secrets in a book as
        opposed to including secrets in an unpublished manuscript likely
        prompted them to take differing approaches to sharing secrets.</p>

        Entries in Ms. Fr. 640 and <em>The Jewell House</em></h2>
    <p>Sometimes Plat and the author-practitioner took different approaches to
        the same task. For example, both Plat and the author-practitioner shared
        strategies for making varnish dry quickly. Plat recommended boiling the
        oil until it was one-third or one-half consumed and then adding fish
        bones to it.<a href="#fn16"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref16"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> The author-practitioner offered
        more complicated instructions which involved boiling turpentine oil,
        adding pulverized mastic, passing it through a sieve, stirring, and
        adding eau-de-vie.<a href="#fn17"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref17"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> This is evidence that, in some
        cases, Plat and the author-practitioner shared similar concerns but had
        access to different information (or chose to share different
        information) about the tasks that they described. This also hints at
        some of the possible differences between the contexts in which they
        worked. For example, they may have had access to different materials or
        they could have been working under differing time constraints. In this
        instance as in others, the author-practitioner appeared to include more
        experientially-rooted details in his explanation, while Plat’s
        instructions were methodical and precise but not necessarily indicative
        of firsthand experience.</p>
    <p>Plat’s work—and its reception by Elizabethan audiences—was informed by
        his high socio-economic status. Plat’s father had multiple sons, but
        Hugh was the only one to outlive him and became his primary heir. Thus,
        although Plat was a lawyer by training, his life of scholarly inquiry
        was financed by his family’s wealth. His time at Cambridge and Lincoln’s
        Inn, his pedigree, and his publications all helped him to garner a
        reputation as an educated and trustworthy man of science. Plat’s early
        authorial pursuits were not lucrative, but they did win him the respect
        of his contemporaries and a sizable readership.<a href="#fn18"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref18"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
    <p>When London suffered a devastating plague outbreak in 1593, Plat produced
        expensive but effective plague cakes to distribute to Londoners who
        could afford them, including numerous prominent courtiers. Since he did
        not have a medical license, Plat was not permitted to charge fees for
        his cures, but he expected gifts in exchange for his medicines. His
        amateur medical practice was made possible in part by his ability to
        procure rare and costly ingredients, such as herbs and ground bezoar
        stones.<a href="#fn19"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref19"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a> The success of Plat’s plague
        cures was therefore predicated in part on his status. Likewise, the
        subsequent boost to Plat’s reputation can also be partially attributed
        to his high standing.</p>
    <p>Plat thus earned a reputation as a highly educated man who was
        well-versed in science and medicine. By contrast, the
        author-practitioner’s manuscript, especially his imperfect Latin,
        suggests that he had a less scholarly background than Plat. While the
        author-practitioner may have had less formal education than Plat, his
        detailed recipes indicate that he benefited from a wealth of
        experiential knowledge.</p>
    <p>One area in which <em>The Jewell House</em> and Ms. Fr. 640 overlap
        significantly is in their discussions of casting and molding. Their
        general instructions concerning how to cast and mold are often in
        agreement with one another. For example, when describing how to cast
        flowers, the author-practitioner instructed that plants and flowers “are
        not laid on top, but as in air, without touching on any side anything”
        (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/145v/f/145v/tl"><u>145v</u></a>).
        Similarly, Plat wrote that when casting plants, “no part of your branch
        [should] either touch your table in the bottom, or reach to the
        uppermost part of the sides.”<a href="#fn20"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref20"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> Additionally, both Plat and the
        author-practitioner suggested mixing sand and sal ammoniac as a good way
        to prepare plaster for molding. Plat noted that “some put a small
        quantity of sal armoniac to a great proposition of water, and therwith
        temper their pap.”<a href="#fn21"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref21"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a> The author-practitioner gave a
        comparable instruction, writing, “sal ammoniac water is very good, is
        excellent for moistening sands, but for lots of water one only needs a
        little sal ammoniac” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/106r/f/106r/tl"><u>106r</u></a>).
    </p>
    <p>Plat and the author-practitioner also described similar methods for
        preparing plaster of Paris. Both suggest heating plaster of Paris more
        than once and mixing it with sands or powders, but Plat’s instructions
        regarding how to prepare plaster of Paris were more detailed than the
        author-practitioner’s. The author-practitioner wrote that one should mix
        the plaster of Paris with sand and that “it is necessary that it endures
        the fire twice, &amp; is reheated twice” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/106r/f/106r/tl"><u>106r</u></a>).<a
           href="#fn22"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref22"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a> Plat wrote, “You must first
        roast or burne the plaster of Paris, before you mix the same with the
        reste of the powders.”<a href="#fn23"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref23"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a> After the first heating, Plat
        continued, one could prepare the plaster in one of two ways. One could
        break the stones, set them on the coals of a fire and allow them to
        burn, and then beat them into a powder. Alternatively, one could beat
        the plaster in an iron mortar until it became a powder, put the powder
        in an earthen pot, and then set the pot on a fire. Then one should stir
        the mixture “continually, with a wodden spattle for an houre, or there
        abouts, and until you see the spattle leave as it were a visible line,
        or tracte behind it, after you have stirred the powder round there
        with.”<a href="#fn24"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref24"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a> Plat noted that this second
        method was “longer and more troublesome” but that some thought it was “a
        better way” than the first method.<a href="#fn25"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref25"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a> Plat said to break up the stones
        of the plaster of Paris until they became a fine powder; the
        author-practitioner said they should be “lustrous grains nearing the
        shape of sugar” (fol. 106r).<a href="#fn26"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref26"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a> Both the author-practitioner and
        Plat recommended using sal ammoniac to make the plaster of Paris. Plat
        gave a specific proportion in his instructions, writing, “[S]ome
        dissolve an ounce of sal armoniack to every pottle of water.”<a
           href="#fn27"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref27"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
    <p>In his instructions for making plaster of Paris, Plat included
        information that might suggest that he was personally familiar with the
        process, such as specific notes about which method was “longer and more
        troublesome” and visual details about how to recognize when the plaster
        of Paris was sufficiently stirred.<a href="#fn28"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref28"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a> He also referenced the ideas and
        opinions of other people, using phrases such as “some men do” and
        “others thinke.”<a href="#fn29"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref29"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a> This example is notable because
        it is an instance in which Plat described a process using more

    <p>The author-practitioner’s instructions about casting and molding were
        often more detailed—and more suggestive of firsthand experience—than
        Plat’s. For example, he included details about when and how to pick the
        right plants or flowers for molding, while Plat said only “take a branch
        of rosemarie, tyme, or isope, &amp;c”.<a href="#fn31"

           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/117v/f/117v/tl"><u>117v</u></a>),
        “Carnation” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/159v/f/159v/tl"><u>159v</u></a>,
        fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/143v/f/143v/tl"><u>143v</u></a>),
        and “a marigold with its leaves” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/146r/f/146r/tl"><u>146r</u></a>),
        in separate entries. This suggests that the author-practitioner, unlike
        Plat, was familiar with specific details pertaining to the casting of
        different flowers.</p>
    <p>Other examples also indicate that the author-practitioner had
        experiential knowledge of the processes of casting and molding. In one
        entry entitled “Toad,” the author-practitioner provided instructions
        about how to use a toad for life-casting. He wrote, “you could make your
        cast in one piece &amp; large, but it would be awkward to cut” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/143r/f/143r/tl"><u>143r</u></a>).
        He recommended instead that “it is best to do it in three or 4 parts”
        (fol. 143r). In addition to these practical instructions, he gave advice
        in another entry that suggested that he was familiar with the sort of
        mishaps that one might encounter in the process of preparing a toad for
        life-casting. He wrote, “if by chance you want to mold this vile animal
        &amp; if it were to piss in your hand, it would burn your hand &amp;
        itch, as if you had handled nettles. But the most powerful remedy for
        this is to put your hand into fresh earth, &amp; to cover it as if you
        wanted to bury it.” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/109v/f/109v/tl"><u>109v</u></a>).
    </p>
    <p>Plat was less thorough in his discussion of preparing toads for
        life-casting. He wrote, “Some doo kill Toades and frogs, which they
        meane to cast, by leaving them in oyle till they die, and some do put
        strong water into their mouthes.”<a href="#fn32"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref32"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a> He did not include additional
        information about how to cast or mold a toad specifically (as opposed to
        another animal or object). The author-practitioner suggested a
        comparable method for killing snakes, lizards, “&amp; other similar
        beasts” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/109v/f/109v/tl"><u>109v</u></a>).
        He wrote that these animals should be submerged “in a bottle of good
        vinegar &amp; some eau-de-vie” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/109v/f/109v/tl"><u>109v</u></a>).
        Thus, while the two men had comparable ideas about how to kill a toad
        for life-casting, Ms. Fr. 640 includes a level of detail that suggests
        greater familiarity with the process.</p>
    <p>Similarly, an analysis of comparable entries in Ms. Fr. 640 and <em>The
            Jewell House</em> suggests that the author-practitioner had more
        experience with weapons than Plat. Plat’s descriptions of how to make
        weapons were succinct and do not include much detail. By contrast, the
        author-practitioner’s descriptions of how to make and use weapons were
        detailed enough to suggest that he had firsthand experience with weapons
        and warfare. In an entry entitled “Defense of a town” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/21v/f/21v/tl"><u>21v</u></a>),
        the author-practitioner wrote, “there is nothing that has a greater
        effect for the defense of a breach than petards placed at the entryway
        at the time of the assault.” He went on to describe the best kind of
        shrapnel to use in a petard (a small bomb) including “cart nails, large
        steel dice, bits of chain &amp; similar things.” He also recommended
        using grenades and provided tips on how to make them more effective by
        “putting coarsely pestled glass either in the molds or in the crucible,
        when one wants to cast them.” He advised that the grenades “ought not to
        be too brittle” and that they should be “somewhat alloyed with the
        substance of the pieces in order that, holding the blast a little rather
        than breaking, they have more violence.” In other entries, the
        author-practitioner went into even more detail about how to construct,
        load, and use grenades, petards, cannons, and other weapons. He included
        such specific details as how much a petard should weigh if one planned
        to place it against a door or iron grate—“40 or 50 lb” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/23r/f/23r/tl"><u>23r</u></a>)—
        and how many horses it took to move various types of cannons—for “large
        culverins [...] one needs fifteen or sixteen horses” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/18r/f/18r/tl"><u>18r</u></a>).
        The specificity of his instructions and the tone of his writing make it
        seem likely that he was drawing on his own experience.<a href="#fn33"

           id="fnref33"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
    <p>By contrast, when Plat wrote about weapons, he made it clear that he was
        drawing on the experiences of others. In an entry entitled “How to make
        a Pistol whose barrell is two foote in length to deliver a bullet point
        blank at eight skore,” Plat wrote a single sentence describing how to
        load such a pistol with “a bullet a thought bigger than the bore” by
        ramming it with a “skowring stick.”<a href="#fn34"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref34"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a> He continued that he had learned
        “This of an English gentleman of good note and of an approved
        experiment.”<a href="#fn35"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref35"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>35</sup></a> In another entry, he provided
        brief instructions about how to construct a weapon with a “peece,” a
        hooking iron, and “the bore of a Tennis ball.”<a href="#fn36"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref36"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>36</sup></a> He noted that he did not come up
        with this method himself, but learned it from “the fine lymner of
        Lambeth.”<a href="#fn37"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref37"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>37</sup></a> He also indicated that his
        knowledge of this weapon was limited, writing, “I leave the full use

           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref38"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>38</sup></a> Thus, while the
        author-practitioner likely had experience with weapons and perhaps had
        used them personally, Plat’s experience with weapons was limited, but he
        was keen to show that the knowledge had been acquired from others, and
        required testing by those with greater experience.</p>

        The significance of space and networks in Ms. Fr. 640 and <em>The Jewell

    <p>The fact that Plat may have had less firsthand experience with weapons
        and the processes of casting and molding than the author-practitioner
        did is significant because personal experience was a key issue for Plat.
        On the title page of the 1594 edition of <em>The Jewell House,</em> just
        underneath the work’s title and above Plat’s own name, were the words,
        “Faithfully and familiarly set downe, according to the Author’s own
        experience.” In the preface, Plat wrote that his work was different from
        the works of other “excellent Artists of our age” because it was based
        on personal experience.<a href="#fn39"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref39"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>39</sup></a> He wrote, “[S]ome of them having

    <p>Plat often noted in <em>The Jewell House</em> when he had witnessed or
        performed a task himself. Although he was well-versed in philosophy, his
        writings indicate that he valued practical knowledge over philosophical
        or theoretical knowledge. In his essay in <em>The Jewell House</em> on
        soil and husbandry, he wrote, “I must here acknowledge that the best
        naturall phylosophie that I ever coulde learne at this point was neither
        out of Aristotles phisicks, nor Velcuries naturall philosophy, nor
        <em>Garsceus</em> meteors, nor out of any of the old philosophical
        Fathers, that writ so many hundred years past; but that which I have, I
        gathered it on the backside of Moore fieldes.”<a href="#fn41"

    <p>Moorfields was an open ground to the north of London that was first
        drained and leveled in 1527.<a href="#fn42"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref42"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>42</sup></a> In Plat’s day, the land was
        owned by the city of London and used by various types of people from
        around the city. Some used the land for recreation, such as archery or a
        leisurely stroll, while others used it to graze animals or dry
        laundry.<a href="#fn43"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref43"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>43</sup></a> Plat’s claim that he “gathered”
        the knowledge is ambiguous as to whether he actually worked the fields
        himself, but his assertion suggests that he may have had experience
        working the land for agricultural cultivation, or at least that he had
        witnessed others doing so firsthand. This example illustrates not only
        the importance that Plat ascribed to personal experience, but also the
        way in which Plat’s knowledge was locally rooted in the London area.
        Plat stressed the importance of place in his writing, noting that he had
        gathered his knowledge “within the lists and limits of London.”<a

           id="fnref46"

        collaboration within and among diverse groups of people, and it made
        these people aware that their work would be studied and evaluated by
        others. Drawing upon Plat’s published works and his unpublished
        notebooks, Harkness demonstrates that Plat drew his knowledge from a
        diverse network of informants. Plat consulted with Londoners from all
        walks of life, from famed mathematician Thomas Hariot (who told him how
        to construct a cheap, wind-resistant lantern) to humble laboring
        immigrants.<a href="#fn47"

           id="fnref47"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>47</sup></a> Harkness sees the urban context
        of London, with its thousands of diverse residents living in close
        quarters, as having been integral to Plat’s work.</p>
    <p>Ms. Fr. 640 was also informed by the context in which the
        author-practitioner worked and wrote. Several entries in the manuscript
        indicate that the author-practitioner was probably based in Toulouse.
        Most of the author-practitioner’s mentions of Toulouse in Ms. Fr. 640
        have to do with the acquisition and the nature of specific materials
        there. For example, he wrote that horse hairs for making sieves were
        brought to Toulouse from Spain (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/44v/f/44v/tl"><u>44v</u></a>)
        and described two different types of mats that were available for
        purchase in Toulouse at the time of his writing (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/32v/f/32v/tl"><u>32v</u></a>).
        In an entry entitled “Common saying,” the author-practitioner noted that
        the bell of Toulouse was one of the most beautiful in all of France
        (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/20v/f/20v/tl"><u>20v</u></a>).
        This could be interpreted as a note of local pride, or simply as an
        observation.</p>
    <p>In addition to reflecting the local contexts of the places in which they
        were produced, Ms. Fr. 640 and <em>The Jewell House</em> reflect the
        knowledge networks in which their authors operated. From his
        attributions in <em>The Jewell House</em>, we can glean that Plat’s
        network in London was large, diverse, and knowledgeable about a wide
        range of topics. Because he considered accounts based on personal
        experience to be more reliable than other accounts, Plat noted when he
        had attempted or observed something himself. When he had no firsthand
        knowledge of the task he was describing, he indicated that he received
        the information from a credible source. For example, in an entry
        entitled “A peece whereby to perform some extraordinarie service either
        by sea or land,” Plat wrote that he heard of the technique, which
        details how to build a weapon, from “a Gentleman of good conceipt in all
        ingenious deuities.”<a href="#fn48"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref48"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>48</sup></a> This attribution, while vague,
        works to assure the reader that the source of the information was
        trustworthy. Similarly positive but vague attributions abound throughout
        <em>The Jewell House.</em></p>
    <p>When he could not cite a person, however vaguely, Plat still sought to
        assure his reader that the information he was sharing was credible. For
        example, in describing a means for keeping horses well-fed and
        well-behaved, Plat indicated that he could not personally attest to the
        effectiveness of the method.<a href="#fn49"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref49"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>49</sup></a> Even as he admitted this,
        however, he included details that emphasized to his reader that the
        method probably worked. He noted that the informants from whom he
        received the information were still alive, which suggested that the
        method was not outdated. Crucially, those travelers “speak of their own
        experience, and not by bare report from others.”<a href="#fn50"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref50"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>50</sup></a> Where Plat relies on others’
        experience rather than his own, he bolsters its credibility by
        emphasising the authority of its provenance.</p>
    <p>We know much less about the author-practitioner’s knowledge network than
        we do about Plat’s. One of the reasons for this is because the
        author-practitioner made attributions much less frequently than
        Plat<em>.</em> When the author-practitioner referred to other people, he
        tended to do so generally, using phrases such as “some” and “others” to
        refer to other practitioners while avoiding any degree of specificity.<a
           href="#fn51"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref51"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>51</sup></a> In fact, the only named
        attribution is given in a recipe for “Excellent water against the plague
        of Monsieur de Montorsin,” which is described as “a very rare &amp;
        tested secret” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/44v/f/44v/tl"><u>44v</u></a>).
        Although the author-practitioner seems to have been less concerned with
        direct attribution than Plat, he was no less concerned with asserting
        the authority and utility of his recipes. As well as describing them as
        “tested,” he frequently used the word “excellent” (<em>excellent,
            excellents,</em> or <em>excellente)</em> and phrases such as “one
        finds by experience” or “I have experienced” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/88r/f/88r/tl"><u>88r</u></a>).
        Sometimes the author-practitioner combined superlatives with his own
        eyewitness accounts and even with attributions. For example, he
        introduced a description of a method for whitening silver casts with the
        words, “I have seen an excellent German working thus” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/121v/f/121v/tl"><u>121v</u></a>).
        While attribution seems to have been the exception and not the rule, the
        author-practitioner emphasises personal experience and reliable
        witnessing as authoritative sources of confirmation, much like Plat did
        in the <em>Jewell House</em>.</p>
    <p>Both authors’ networks involved exchange as well as accumulation of
        knowledge. Plat was not above bartering one piece of information for
        another, for instance when he disclosed some unnamed secret to the
        distiller John Hester in exchange for his method for catching fish.<a
           href="#fn52"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref52"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>52</sup></a> The author-practitioner, too,
        indicated that he hoped to learn from others by making his own knowledge
        available for exchange. In an entry under the heading “For the
        workshop,” he wrote, “as small peddlers lay open small wares in order to
        buy richer ones &amp; to profit more and more, so I, from a desire to
        learn, am exposing what little is in my workshop to receive, through a
        common commerce of letters, much rarer secrets from my benevolent
        readers” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/162r/f/162r/tl"><u>162r</u></a>).
        This suggests that the author-practitioner saw himself and his
        manuscript as being embedded in a network of people who exchanged
        knowledge. In this entry, the only instance where potential readers of
        the manuscript are mentioned, the author-practitioner intriguingly
        implicates them in his network for exchanging “secrets” of practical
        knowledge.</p>
    <h2 id="secrets-in-ms.-fr.-640-and-the-jewell-house">Secrets in Ms. Fr. 640
        and <em>The Jewell House</em></h2>
    <p>The issue of secrecy arises in both Ms. Fr. 640 and <em>The Jewell
            House</em>. When the author-practitioner mentioned secrets, he often
        seemed to do so in order to emphasize the value or importance of the
        information he was imparting, rather than to indicate that the
        information in question should be kept secret—a rhetorical strategy
        which was common in the “books of secrets” tradition which rapidly
        gained popularity in this period.<a href="#fn53"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref53"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>53</sup></a> Although he called Monsieur de
        Montorsin’s medicinal water a “secret,” he still shared the recipe for
        how to make it. Similarly, in an entry entitled, “Against redness of the
        face,” the author-practitioner wrote, “make a small lead cap &amp; wear
        it overnight. Excellent secret. Try a lead mask” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/77r/f/77r/tl"><u>77r</u></a>).
        The author-practitioner seems to have been willing to share his secrets,
        which consisted more in techniques and tricks than in secrets in a
        modern sense.</p>
    <p>Plat also shared secrets in his writing, particularly in the first
        section of <em>The Jewell House,</em> when he thought that they would
        benefit others. For example, in an entry about how to harden leather so
        that it would last longer, he wrote that the method he described was a
        secret, but that it was so effective and would be so useful to “the
        whole lande” that he chose to share it.<a href="#fn54"

    <p>Both the author-practitioner and Plat thus valued secrets, and both men
        were interested in trading their secrets for some kind of gain. The
        author-practitioner was explicitly interested in intellectual gain, at
        least by the evidence of fol. 162r, and may also have been interested in
        monetary gain; Plat was interested in both intellectual and monetary
        exchange. The author-practitioner’s entry “For the workshop” (<em>Pour
            la boutique</em>), quoted above, suggests that he envisioned a space
        in which to exchange knowledge and wares. (The word <em>boutique</em>
        can be translated as either “shop” or “workshop”). Plat’s notebooks
        include plans for a shop, which he called his “Jewell house,” in which
        to market his “Secrets and Wares.”<a href="#fn60"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref60"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>60</sup></a> Whether a literal shop or a
        conceptual boutique, both authors seem to have wished to exchange
        knowledge for money or further secrets.</p>
    <p>In some cases, however, Plat was not willing to share secrets, even for
        monetary gain. In the section in <em>The Jewell House</em> on casting
        and molding, Plat used the imperative while instructing the reader to
        cast and mold. The style and tone of his writing suggest that he
        intended his work to function as a sort of manual or set of instructions
        for a practitioner. These instructions, however, are incomplete. Plat
        wrote that he was reluctant to include all he knew in his instructions
        because doing so would evoke the ire of artisans who may have felt
        threatened by the sharing of their trade secrets. “And as I looke for
        thankes of many that are ignorant herein, I am sure to receive blame of
        those who with long travaile and expence, have scarcely attained much
        skill as they may find in this work with a few houres study,” he
        explained. “Neither may I safely set down the infinite use of this arte,
        for fear of the infinite abuse which would follow by the lewde, and
        sinister practices of idle, and ill-disposed persons.”<a href="#fn61"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref61"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>61</sup></a> Given the published, public
        nature of his work, Plat was concerned about the preservation of his own
        social capital.</p>
    <p>In one instance, Plat referred his reader “to the Goldsmithes” for more
        information about how to color patterns in gold.<a href="#fn62"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref62"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>62</sup></a> “Although I could easily set
        down both the matter, and the manner thereof,” he wrote, “but because
        therein I should discover a secret, that concerneth the whole trade, I
        have thought good to suppress it for this time.”<a href="#fn63"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref63"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>63</sup></a> This is a notable contrast to
        his apparent lack of concern for threatening the livelihoods of
        curriers, ironworkers, and brewers by disclosing secrets relevant to
        their professions in the first section of his book.</p>
    <p>The rhetoric of revealing secrets was common in early modern alchemical
        texts and books of secrets.<a href="#fn64"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref64"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>64</sup></a> Plat’s choice not to reveal more
        information about the processes of casting and molding, however, raises
        some questions. Was he really as knowledgeable about casting and molding
        techniques as he claimed to be? Did his vagueness allow him to take
        credit for someone else’s ideas? We can only speculate about the answers
        to these questions, but they suggest that Plat may have been vague as a
        rhetorical strategy.</p>
    <p>Throughout his section on casting and molding, Plat often implied, and
        sometimes explicitly stated, that he had more knowledge than he chose to
        share with the reader out of concern for how his text would be received
        by the public, particularly those whose trade secrets he described
        (i.e., his informants, or members of his knowledge network). This degree
        of reflexivity is absent from Ms. Fr. 640. The anonymous
        author-practitioner did not seem as anxious as Plat about disclosing the
        secrets of craftspeople, nor did he worry that setting their secrets to
        paper might make him unwelcome in certain circles. In an entry entitled,
        “For the workshop,” the author-practitioner made reference to artisans
        who might “complain that one discovers their craft secrets.” He wrote
        that if “the jealous disapprove that these things are picked up &amp;
        taken from others,” one should remind them that “nothing is yet said
        which has not been said or done before,” and that no-one should presume
        “to invent anything new”—all one can do is to “rediscover”
        long-forgotten secrets and “publish them for those who do not know them”
        (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/66r/f/66r/tl"><u>66r</u></a>).
        This indicates that the author-practitioner was mindful that the sharing
        of craft secrets might upset some artisans. He does not, however, seem
        to have been overly concerned about the consequences of sharing these
        secrets, and in fact provides a philosophical justification for doing
        so.</p>
    <p>Like Plat, the author-practitioner may have been bound by social or
        professional constraints. He described craft processes that belonged to
        specific professions, which may have meant that he was a member of a
        professional group. However, he also described craft processes that did
        not belong to particular trades, and he included recipes detailing
        techniques that members of professional organizations would not have
        been allowed to practice. This suggests that while the
        author-practitioner had a broad set of skills relating to craft
        professions, he was not bound by professional constraints, or he chose
        to ignore them.<a href="#fn65"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref65"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>65</sup></a></p>
    <p>It is worth noting that unlike the author-practitioner, Plat published
        his work. Although the author-practitioner may have intended to publish
        his work or at least show it to other people, we cannot know this for
        certain. In writing that he hoped “to receive, through a common commerce
        of letters, much rarer secrets from my benevolent readers,” the
        author-practitioner possibly gestured towards a future readership (fol.
        <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/162r/f/162r/tl"><u>162r</u></a>).
        Unlike Plat, however, he did not yet have a clearly established audience
        at the time he wrote the manuscript. Plat was already a published author
        before writing <em>The Jewell House.</em></p>
    <p>There is some scholarly disagreement as to how Plat’s audience received
        <em>The Jewell House.</em> Harkness contends that <em>The Jewell
            House</em> helped to cement Plat’s status as a reputable author and
        purveyor of “natural knowledge.”<a href="#fn66"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref66"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>66</sup></a> Thick suggests that Harkness
        overstates the importance of <em>The Jewell House</em> in building
        Plat’s reputation, pointing out that Plat was disappointed that <em>The
            Jewell House</em> did not receive more acclaim and that it was far
        from his most popular work.<a href="#fn67"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref67"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>67</sup></a> His book <em>Delightes for
            Ladies,</em> published in 1600 (or 1602) by the same publisher that
        had printed the first copies of <em>The Jewell House</em> years before,
        would become Plat’s most widely read book.<a href="#fn68"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref68"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>68</sup></a> <em>Delightes for Ladies</em>
        was a cookbook intended primarily for female readers, while <em>The
            Jewell House</em> was aimed at any reader who might benefit from its
        contents.</p>
    <p>Plat had a clear idea of who his audience was and often addressed them
        directly in <em>The Jewell House</em>. He was also acutely aware that
        his work would impact how he was received in society and how he was
        viewed in the scientific community in London. If his claims were faulty,
        his reputation would suffer; if he alienated goldsmiths, he might face
        social consequences. This may have also threatened his ability to
        continue carrying out his processes of observation and investigation,
        since he drew upon his social networks to accrue this information.<a
           href="#fn69"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref69"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>69</sup></a> Since the author-practitioner

    <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>This comparison of Ms. Fr. 640 and <em>The Jewell House</em> has shown
        that Hugh Plat and the author-practitioner were interested in some
        similar subjects, such as weaponry, casting and molding. In some
        instances, the author-practitioner’s more detailed instructions suggest
        that he may have had more experience with the subjects at hand than
        Plat. This is significant because firsthand experience was a key issue
        for Plat. Both Plat and the author-practitioner drew on networks of
        knowledge to accrue the information that they shared in their works.
        Plat’s network was wide and diverse, but we know relatively little about
        the author-practitioner’s network.</p>
    <p>A close reading of Ms. Fr. 640 suggests that the author-practitioner was
        engaged in processes of knowledge exchange and that he hoped to learn
        more via exchange in the future, but that he was fairly unconcerned
        about revealing trade secrets. Plat, by contrast, chose not to reveal
        certain trade secrets about casting and molding. This could be an
        indication of his wish to maintain good social relationships with those
        in his network, or it could be the result of gaps in his knowledge. Both
        the author-practitioner and Plat thought about potential readers and
        attempted to establish the credibility and utility of the information
        they shared.</p>
    <p>Although <em>The Jewell House</em> and Ms. Fr. 640 are comparable to one
        another in some ways, the differences between them are telling. Based on
        an analysis of some of the areas of overlap between them, such as
        weapons, casting, and molding, we can conclude that the
        author-practitioner had more knowledge about weapons than Hugh Plat,
        possibly derived from his firsthand experience with weapons. In
        addition, the author-practitioner may have had more experiential
        knowledge about casting and molding than Plat. A study of Plat’s
        description of how to prepare plaster of Paris suggests that he had
        firsthand experience with some processes of casting and molding. By
        comparison, the author-practitioner provides extensive details about
        various aspects of these processes that are suggestive of
        experientially-rooted expertise. It is difficult to draw conclusions
        about Plat’s knowledge of casting and molding, however, because he
        stated that he had more knowledge about casting and molding than he was
        willing to share. Plat’s unwillingness to share these secrets may have
        stemmed from his desire to maintain good relations with those in his
        knowledge network. Both the author-practitioner and Plat worked within
        knowledge networks, as evidenced by the attributions in their respective
        works. They also each sought to trade knowledge and secrets for personal
        gain. This comparison thus highlights the importance of experience and
        exchange in early modern knowledge networks.</p>

                    “Moulding &amp; casting.” Both men mention heating it more
                    than once. Author-practitioner (AP) says: mix in some sand
                    so that it can endure the fire twice, it should be reheated
                    twice. HP says: some say to make it burnt, and then set them
                    in a fire (thus, heating them twice). Plat says to break up
                    the stones until they are like fine powder; AP says they
                    should be like grains of sand. Close, but different in
                    texture. Both mention mixing it with sand and say to use sal
                    ammoniac; Plat gives a specific proportion (an ounce for
                    every “pottle” of water). AP says that the gold should be
                    very fine, and Plat says it should be like a fine powder.
                    They seem to be getting at the same things here.

            Plat writes about a more diverse range of things - building
            materials, animals, drinks. He also has some instances that could be
            construed as being about keeping things cost effective, such as “How
            to roast meate more speedily, and with less fire than we do in our
            common manner” (E12) and "How to turn spittes with one hande,

            materials and therefore, by extension, money, that might also be

                <p>Steven Shapin uses the term “virtual witnessing” to describe
                    writing that was intended to produce “such an image of an
                    experimental scene as obviates the necessity for either its
                    direct witness or its replication.” Shapin argues that
                    seventeenth-century inventor and experimenter Robert Boyle
                    used virtual witnessing to build credibility. By making his
                    readers virtual witnesses, Boyle multiplied the number of
                    people who witnessed his work, which made his claims more
                    credible. Deborah Harkness writes that the work of some of
                    Plat’s contemporaries, particularly the notebooks of Robert
                    Draper, can be seen in the same light, as examples of
                    virtual witnessing. Thus, early modern writers used vividly
                    illustrative descriptions of processes of experimentation in
                    order to build credibility. Plat’s description of how to
                    make plaster of Paris is one example of an instance in which
                    he included such vividly illustrative detail. He might have
                    included these details in his work in order to build his
                    credibility by making his readers “virtual witnesses” to his
                    work. Although the author-practitioner also included details
                    in his manuscript that might make a reader a “virtual
                    witness” to his work, I doubt that he did this as a
                    deliberate strategy to build credibility. Instead, his
                    inclusion of these details was likely reflective of his
                    extensive firsthand experience with the processes he

                <p>Ayesha Mukherjee writes that Plat had a shop that he called
                    his “Jewell House” on or near Bethnal Green. She takes as
                    evidence the fact that Plat had two nearly identical
                    inventories that listed the wares of his shop, and wrote
                    about furnishing it in a letter to his cousin. Malcolm Thick
                    casts doubt on whether or not such a shop actually existed,
                    but notes that Plat sold goods (and possibly also secrets)
                    out of his London home. Deborah Harkness interprets the
                    title of Plat’s book <em>The Jewell House</em> as a
                    reference to the value of the “jewels” of knowledge that
                    Plat shared in the book, but Mukherjee argues that this
                    interpretation is too metaphorical. While both Mukherjee and
                    Thick agree that Plat likely intended the title of the book
                    to refer to the value of the knowledge inside, they indicate
                    that he may also have used it as a means to advertise a
                    place where he sold his wares. As Thick notes, however, Plat
                    intended entry into his “Jewell house” to be by invitation
                    only, which could mean that he was only interested in
                    certain sorts of buyers or that the “Jewell House” really
                    was as metaphorical as Harkness suggests. See Mukherjee,

                <p>William Eamon writes that books of secrets typically
                    “represented themselves as serving natural philosophical
                    ends as well as utility. In other words, ‘secrets’ tended to
                    be regarded as clues leading the investigator to uncover the
                    <em>secrets of nature.</em>” <em>The Jewell House</em> fits
                    this description. For more, see: William Eamon, “How to Read
