        <div>
            <p>Ms. Fr. 640 contains a large number of recipes for and reports
                about various mixtures of sands and binders in making sand
                molds. This essay examines and reconstructs the “<em>Eau
                    magistra</em>” (fols. <a
                   href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/84v/f/84v/tl"><u>84v</u></a>
                and <a
                   href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/87v/f/87v/tl"><u>87v</u></a>)
                made from elm roots boiled in wine. Its efficacy in facilitating
                a fine impression in a sand mold and in receiving and
                withstanding the molten metals was then tested and compared to
                other binding agents found in Ms. Fr. 640. The meaning of
                “<em>magistra</em>” as a substance that can transform the state
                of materials is discussed.</p>

    <h2 id="sands-and-binders">Sands and Binders</h2>
    <p>BnF Ms. Fr. 640 contains many entries that describe sand-casting
        processes, both for making sand molds and for casting into sand molds.
        To make a successful mold, a dry “sand” and a wet binding agent are
        combined to create a mixture that is able to take and hold an
        impression, as well as withstand the heat and pressure of a molten
        material.</p>
    <p>A “sand” can be made from a variety of materials. The author-practitioner
        mentions, among many options, calcined ox hooves, pulverized sand, and
        burned felt, as ingredients in sand molds.<a href="#fn1"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref1"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> Ms. Fr. 640 also cites diverse
        materials that may be used as “wet” binding agents, which are often
        called “Magistry” or <em>magistra</em> in early modern craft recipes. In
        <em>Pirotechnia</em>, Biringuccio provides a recipe for making a
        magistry of salt and water: “Because it is necessary that the powders
        made for casting have a magistery of salt water, I wish now to teach you
        to prepare the salt that must form this magistery, for without it these
        powders would not have the toughness to hold themselves together when
        they dry.”<a href="#fn2"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref2"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> Hugh Plat also uses this term in
        an entry in his 1594 <em>Jewel house of art and nature</em>, but not in
        the context of molding or casting processes.<a href="#fn3"
           class="footnote-ref"

    <h2 id="magistra"><em>Magistra</em></h2>
    <p>What is the meaning of “<em>magistra,</em>” and why might it be used in
        these binder recipes? Do these binders have special properties that
        would merit the term “magistry,” or does the word have multiple
        meanings? Moreover, what are these binders, are they all alike, or can
        some be called “magisterial,” and others not? By considering the
        materials used in Ms. Fr. 640’s mold-making recipes and by investigating
        the materials themselves, it is possible to understand why one binding
        agent might be preferable to another. For example, egg whites as a
        binder may give a different strength than wine and elm root decoction.
    </p>
    <p>The French term <em>magistra</em> is derived from the Latin word
        <em>magisterium</em>, used in classical Latin to refer to the office of
        a magistrate, and sometimes used later in medieval Latin to refer to the
        philosophers’ stone.<a href="#fn4"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref4"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> The term <em>magistra</em> does
        not appear in Randle Cotgrave’s 1611 French-English dictionary, although
        he defines a related word <em>magistère</em> as “Maistership,
        authoritie, sway, cheefe rule, also, maisterie, a maisters part, or
        maisterpeece.”<a href="#fn5"

           id="fnref5"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> This entry is followed by several
        related terms that may relate to the author-practitioner’s use of
        <em>magistra</em>: the adjective <em>magistral</em> implies skilled
        mastery: “Magistrall; of a maister, or magistrate, or maister; also,
        maister-like; artificiall, skilfull, cunning.”<a href="#fn6"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref6"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> The adverb
        <em>magistralement</em> similarly connotes skill: “Maister-like,

           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref7"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> Turning to English usage, the
        <em>Oxford English Dictionary</em> defines “Magistry” as having chymical
        import, with most usage of the word in seventeenth-century texts.<a
           href="#fn8"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref8"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> Magistry can mean a “master
        principle of nature, free of impurities...a substance, such as the
        philosopher’s stone, capable of transmuting or changing the nature of
        other substances,” but can also denote the “residuum obtained by an acid
        solution; a precipitate; a resinous extract.”<a href="#fn9"

           id="fnref9"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> In alchemical texts, the
        magistery or <em>magisterium</em> can refer to the great work, the
        <em>opus magnum</em>, or the attainment of the philosophers’ stone by
        which the corruptions of both humans and metals could be rectified and
        brought to a higher state of health. In <em>Archidoxis</em>, Paracelsus
        writes, “This therefore is a <em>Magistery</em>, viz that which can be
        Extracted out of things without any separation or Preparation of the
        Elements, and yet notwithstanding, the Powers and virtues of things, are
        by the addition of some thing, attracted into that matter and conserved
        there.”<a href="#fn10"

           role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> While <em>magistra</em>, or
        magistery, possesses several meanings, in Ms. Fr. 640, it would seem to
        have two dimensions: first, as a masterpiece of skill, and, second, as a
        substance that can effect material transformation, for example, in Ms.
        Fr. 640, “<em>eau magistra</em>” can render a dry substance moist, or
        “tempered,” and a lean substance fat, or unctuous.</p>
    <p>In a recipe for casting on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/68r/f/68r/tl"><u>68r</u></a>,
        the author-practitioner specifies that a sand “releases very neatly,
        does not want to be moistened with magistra or anything else, but needs
        to be completely dry, in its natural state, finely pulverized.” Because
        both wine and “well-beaten glair of egg” (i.e., egg whites) are
        mentioned on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/84v/f/84v/tl"><u>84v</u></a>
        as substances with which to moisten sands, <em>Magistra</em> would seem
        in contrast to indicate a mixture. Moreover, on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/69r/f/69r/tl"><u>69r</u></a>,
        the author-practitioner specifies wine <em>or magistra</em>, and
        <em>magistra or</em> egg glair. Thus, the author-practitioner
        differentiates here between <em>magistra</em> and binding agents that
        are not mixtures of two or more ingredients. Indeed, on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/84v/f/84v/tl"><u>84v</u></a>,
        salt and water, and wine and elm root are named as <em>magistras</em>.
    </p>
    <p>On fol. 84v, elm roots boiled in wine are given as a better alternative
        to salt water, which “some people” think is “not good.” This mixture is
        also mentioned on fols. <a

        it is used for molds in which copper will be cast; and, on 86r, where
        the author-practitioner recounts his experiments with sands, he gives
        egg glair as an alternative to the wine and elm root mixture: “Since
        then I molded the bone of oxen feet, burned, pulverized, &amp; sieved
        through a double sieve &amp; <del>hum</del>
        <del>fort</del> moistened with glair of egg or wine boiled with elm

    <p>Both “<em>Eau magistra</em>” on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/84v/f/84v/tl"><u>84v</u></a>
        and “<em>Magistra</em>” on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/87v/f/87v/tl"><u>87v</u></a>
        describe how the decoction should be made: “Founders take the roots of a
        young elm when it is in sap, &amp; boil it in wine, or better yet
        vinegar, and keep it all year long in a barrel” (fol. 87v). There are
        several interesting points to note about this entry: first, the
        author-practitioner writes about founders in the third person, possibly
        excluding himself from this group; second, the fact that the
        <em>magistra</em> is made in large quantities and stored, indicating
        that the time of year and the rising of the sap in the tree is
        important; and, third, that wine and vinegar are apparently equivalent
        for making this decoction.</p>
    <p>In our experiments to reconstruct different <em>magistras</em>, we were
        able to make a substance that performed well in sand-casting and that
        behaved similarly to egg white, or glair. We set out to follow the
        recipe, a seemingly straightforward process, as the manuscript simply
        instructs to boil wine with elm root. Nevertheless, we encountered
        various obstacles in its recreation. To begin, we chose an inexpensive
        Cabernet Sauvignon, given the apparent equivalence between wine and
        vinegar. We were unable to harvest elm root when the sap was rising,
        instead using slippery elm inner bark powder, which is still used in CAM
        (Complementary and Alternative Medicine) recipes.<a href="#fn11"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref11"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> We substituted this for the
        freshly harvested elm root.<a href="#fn12"

        recipes to determine the quantity. Boiling one cup of wine with two
        teaspoons of powdered slippery elm bark resulted in a viscous liquid
        that smelled of fruit and had the thick, mucilaginous texture of egg
        whites. The substance coheres, forming globules much like the
        mucous-like character of egg whites, but with a more uneven
        consistency (<i><u>Fig. 1</u></i>).<a href="#fn14"

    <h2 id="glair-of-egg">Glair of egg</h2>
    <p>As discussed above, egg whites were also used as a binding agent and are
        mentioned in several recipes in Ms. Fr. 640;<a href="#fn15"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref15"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> however it is unclear if the
        author-practitioner considered egg whites to be a <em>magistra</em>, or,
        as his aforementioned account of sand experiments on fol. <a

        implies, it was an alternative to using <em>magistra</em>.<a

           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref16"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> In the entry “Glair of eggs”
        (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/82r/f/82r/tl"><u>82r</u></a>)
        the author-practitioner suggests that its particular advantage as a
        binding agent is its strength: “Glair of eggs gives strength to sand to
        make several casts.” Other entries in Ms. Fr. 640 use egg glair for
        molding and casting: on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/83r/f/83r/tl"><u>83r</u></a>,
        in “Another sand,” the author-practitioner recommends mixing well-beaten
        egg glair with clay earth and vine charcoal, calcining the mixture, then
        tempering it with vinegar. In the entry for “Sand for lead, the most
        excellent of all, for high and low reliefs”on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/84v/f/84v/tl"><u>84v</u></a>,
        egg glair is used to moisten ceruse (lead white) for use in a mold. On
        fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/85v/f/85v/tl"><u>85v</u></a>
        in “Founder,” egg glair is mixed with earth in making the mold for
        bells. The recipe “Excellent sand for lead, tin and copper” on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/86v/f/86v/tl"><u>86v</u></a>,
        which mentions many materials for sand molds, including burned bone,
        iron dross, and burned felt, uses egg glair as a binder, and reportedly
        enabled more than one cast in the mold.</p>
    <h2 id="the-squeeze-test">The Squeeze Test</h2>
    <p>We tested both egg whites and the elm root and wine decoction as binders
        for sand molding in frames. Our sand was made of previously-used molds
        (which had been made from 1:1 crushed brick and plaster of Paris).<a
           href="#fn17"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref17"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> While they had small
        differences, the sand mixture with egg glair and that with elm root
        decoction were very similar to one another in tactile handfeel
        properties. When mixed with the sand, the consistency for both mixtures
        was almost more oily than wet, and the sand clumped like moist brown
        sugar rather than a soft, wet clay. It was easy to tell when the
        consistency of the sand made it ready for the molds: we used a “squeeze
        test” described in “Casting in frames” on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/118v/f/118v/tl"><u>118v</u></a>:
        the sand should give “a good hold, nevertheless coming apart easily”
        (<em>faisoict bonne prise sesmiant touteffois aisement)</em>. The
        importance of this expression, which is used several times in the
        manuscript, about how to determine the correct liquid content and
        consistency of molding sand became clear to us as we worked. In order to
        make this test, we took a handful of the sand mixture and squeezed it
        into the palm. If it held together, but could also be easily broken
        apart by applying pressure to it with a fingertip, it was ready for
        molding(<i><u>Fig. 2</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 3</u></i>). This was in
        contrast to another sand we made using ammonium chloride and brandy as a
        binder, in which the sand turned out muddy and wet, very different from
        when we used egg glair or the elm root-wine decoction (<i><u>Fig. 4</u></i>). The two sands made with egg glair and elm root-wine decoction
        packed exceptionally well into the frame molds. They did not seem too
        moist or too dry, and both produced detailed impressions (<i><u>Fig. 5</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 6</u></i>).<a href="#fn18"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref18"

    <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>In conclusion, our research shows the author-practitioner’s interest in
        experimenting with different types of binders, including
        <em>magistra</em>. All these binders, whether labelled as
        <em>magistra</em> or not, played a crucial role in transforming
        substances from one state to another in order to produce new properties:
        in this case, to create a sand of just the right consistency that would
        withstand the casting of molten metal. Our experiments with egg glair
        replicated the statements in Ms. Fr. 640 about the strength of this
        binding agent and its ability to withstand multiple castings. The
        <em>magistra</em> made with elm root and wine also performed well, and
        might have had the added benefit of being able to be made in large
        quantities and stored for long periods of time.</p>

                <p>According to the OED, the earliest English usage of the term
                    “Magistry” as it is defined in alchemy and chemistry is by
                    Hugh Plat, “Howe to keepe the juice of Oranges, and Lemons
                    all the yeare, for sauce, julepps, and other purposes” in
                    <em>Jewel house</em>, 37. Plat continues, “But because such
                    secrets are fitter for a philosophers laboratory, then a
                    gentlewomans closet, I wil not...discover any magistery upon
                    so base an occasion.” Of course, the OED may not have
                    captured craft usages of Magistery before Plat’s writing.<a

                <p>Other evidence in the manuscript and Biringuccio’s discussion
                    of <em>magistra</em> suggest that <em>magistra</em> differs
                    from other binders in its inclusion of material perceived as
                    salts. In Biringuccio and other metalworkers’ material
                    imaginary, salt seemed to provide “fat,” or unctuosity, to
                    the lean sand. Like the healthy human body, a good mold must
                    also be in balance; in the case of the mold, the balance is
                    between fat and lean. The mix of these qualities provided
                    for a mold that took an impression well, and was very
                    robust, not too brittle on being heated and in pouring the
