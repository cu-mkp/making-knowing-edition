        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <div>
            <p>Ms. Fr. 640 contains numerous references to Languedoc and
                Toulouse. The most numerous entries referring to Toulouse by
                name are about an excellent sand which can be gathered from the
                Toulouse environs and used to make molds for metal casting.
                These entries are particularly interesting for their account of
                firsthand experience and their observations about the properties
                of natural and artificial sands. They are detailed enough that
                they can be followed to locate and gather Toulouse sand suitable
                for making molds for metal casting. This essay recounts the
                search for Toulouse sand and the reconstructions made with it in
                the Making and Knowing Lab.</p>

        white like salt and lean, that glassmakers &amp; potters use,” and he
        apparently made trials of it for mold making, noting that it “becomes

    <blockquote>
        <p>The steel that farriers &amp; iron workers commonly use is not

            bars which are transported in flat ingots from the forges of Foix
            &amp; elsewhere, there is a harder &amp; whiter &amp; finer kind
            than the other, as it comes from the mine. And the workers choose it
            &amp; use it like the other steel. And because [<del>that</del>] it
            comes from common iron, they call it strong iron. But it is not as

            for being too vigorous. This is why one alternately does pastel woad
            and wheat there. For the cultivation of pastel woad, one ploughs the
            soil with shovels of iron, as gardeners do. Next, one harrows it
            with rakes, &amp; breaks it up finely as for sowing cooking herbs.
            One commonly sows it on St. Anthony’s day in January. One makes
            eight harvests of it. The first ones are better. The best pastel
            woad of Lauragais is the one from Carmail &amp; the one from
            Auragne. And sometimes the pastel woad is good in one field &amp; in
            the one close by it will hardly have worth. The goodness of the
            pastel woad is known when, put in the mouth, it gives a taste as of
            vinegar, or when crumbling &amp; breaking it, it has some mold-like
            veins which are as if golden or silver. One assays it in the dyers’
            vat, and to fill a vat with it, one needs six balls of it. In this,
            one dyes several locks of wool, and if it dyes fifteen times, it is
            said to be fifteen florins, if it gives xx dyings, xx florins. The
            good kind dyes up to 30 times &amp; commonly up to xxv or 26.</p>

        <p>The sand from Thoulouse, which is taken from the depths of the earth,
            from the small hill of Puy David, is excellent in itself, but to
            make it withstand several castings, I mix it with pulverized
            sandiver &amp; moistened, which hardens it, &amp; takes body &amp;
            bond with it, &amp; makes it withstand <del>more than five</del> as

            like all natural sand, well reheated before putting it to use. One
            pulverizes it, because it is in lumps, then one reheats it in a
            copper kettle or similar thing, until it no longer smokes.</p>

        found higher up is too much a kin of the earth, and the lower is a kin
        of the rock.” This intensive recounting of firsthand experience of the
        Toulouse sand ends on fol. <a

                  class="underline">87v</span></a> with one more entry on “Sand
        from a mine of Thoulouse,” which perhaps serves as a summary of his
        experience with preparing this sand to produce successful molds:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Casting sand coming from the mine, once passed through a double
            sieve, next put in with melted resin, burns &amp; inflames &amp;
            becomes all red &amp; inflamed like iron. Once cold, it is
            completely black and can be ground very finely on porphyry. Having
            prepared it thus &amp; rendered it without asperity on the
            fingernail, I moistened it with beaten glair of egg &amp; beat it
            well, until it was not pasty but rather powdery. I found it of very
            good release, &amp; molded with it in lead &amp; tin very neatly,
            but it wants to be well reheated &amp; at ease.</p>
        <p>Others beat it well in a mortar, in small amounts at a time, &amp;
            thus it is pressed together and rendered very fine. Then they reheat
            it moderately, only to dry it. Next, they grind it dry on porphyry.
            And thus it becomes as if impalpable and not too dried out, <del>it
            </del> and it retains the body &amp; the bond of the earth to which
            it is kin and is better than when it is so burnt. Once moistened
            with glair of egg passed through a sponge, it releases <del>very
                neatly <em>M</em></del> very neatly in low relief, but not for
            figures in high relief. Therefore, since then, I have experimented
            <em>
                <del>lexper</del>
            </em> with moistening it only with very strong vinegar. It released
            a figure which I could not release previously. And I believe that,
            moistening the finest in a fashion as with glair, &amp; the
            coarsest, for filling, with gushes of salt water or wine, that they
            do not join so well. But as they are of one nature &amp; are
            moistened the same, they embrace each other &amp; hold together one
            with the other.</p>
        <p>For molding well, after having prepared your sands, mold in a day.
            Slowly reheat them the next day, then cast them on another.</p>

    <p>The author-practitioner’s experience with Toulouse sand, however, appears
        to have allowed him to draw more general conclusions about the important
        properties of any sand gathered from nature for the purposes of mold
        making. On fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/88v/f/88v/tl"><span
                  class="underline">88v</span></a> in an entry entitled “Mineral
        Sand,” he lays out more general observations about the properties of
        natural sand, noting that color is not a significant marker, but rather,
        the bond it demonstrates by coming out in lumps, yet still breaking
        apart in the hands is the crucial identifying characteristic:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>It does not matter if the color is white or yellow. Above all it must
            be in one piece &amp; as if taken from a quarry or rock formation,
            &amp; the deeper one takes it from, the better. The signs of its
            goodness are that it is thus amassed, and that when removing itself
            in the form of rock, it comes out in lumps &amp; <em>
                <del>qu</del>
            </em> bricks, which demonstrate its bond &amp; that it is not too
            lean.</p>
        <p>However, it should break apart between your hands &amp; have very
            small <em>
                <del>men</del>
            </em> &amp; delicate grains &amp; of the same nature.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>He then instructs in how to remedy sand
        that is not quite delicate enough:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>If it is not delicate enough, you can pass &amp; grind it finely,
            either through water or through a sieve <del>&amp; when it</del> or
            on the porphyry, &amp; in this way, from <em>
                <del>sil</del>
            </em> lean they become fatty &amp; well bound. You can mold with it
            in <em>
                <del>sa</del>
            </em> frame or <em>en noyau</em> without cloth waste, &amp; try it
            with lead, for if with this it does not become porous &amp; casts
            neatly, it will also behave well with copper. Some say that the
            fatty sands do not want the metal to be cast too hot. Artisans who
            work in large works &amp;, who for profit, do not need to grind
            &amp; seek the curiosities of artificial sands, benefit more from
            seeking some that is ready-made by nature, which has the finest
            grain possible, &amp; for small works, they only pass it through a
            sieve. But those who work in small works, finely grind it &amp;
            grind it impalpable, because they do not need a lot of it.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>In an entry on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/90r/f/90r/tl"><span

                  class="underline">v</span></a>, “That any sand can be rendered
        good,” he restates these observations on the potential of sands
        collected from nature to be worked into suitable mold material, noting
        the free gift nature makes to “her children” in providing sand that
        needs little modification. He further specifies that such sand cannot be
        found in all regions, but nonetheless, “you can be certain that in all
        places you can render the sand from a mine good &amp; proper for
        molding.” He notes again the characteristics of this ideal sand as “a
        kin of earth…pulled from the depths of the sand-bed in bricks &amp;
        clods,” in the same terms that he had described Toulouse sand. This
        exceptional passage is worth quoting in full:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Artisans who work in large works &amp; who need to further their
            profit by seeking things already prepared in nature, because she
            does not sell her wares to her children, and to also save the time
            they would use for grinding finely &amp; for artificially preparing
            sands, seek the one of the <em>
                <del>s</del>
            </em> mine<em>
                <del>s</del>
            </em>, which is not too fatty, the one that is a kin of earth, not
            too lean &amp; consequently without bond, but rather that which is
            pulled from the depths of the sand-bed in bricks &amp; clods that
            show its natural compaction, which is quite difficult to break &amp;
            which has a very small &amp; delicate grain, &amp; which is found
            soft when handling it between the fingers. And because the latter is
            only found near the rocks in mountainous areas or lean territories,
            &amp; akin to the <em>arene</em>, it cannot be found <del>in</del>
            in the surroundings of all the <em>bonnes villes</em> where artisans
            willingly gather. And thus, if they do not have it close to their
            house, they prefer to have it come from afar, like from Lyon,
            Venice, Paris near the Sainct Chappelle &amp; similar places, rather
            than prepare it. However, you can be certain that in all places you
            can render the sand from a mine [90v] good &amp; proper for molding.
            For if it is coarse, pass it through a sieve, and if it is not yet
            fine enough, wash it, &amp; when the water has rested a little,
            empty that which is still troubled in some separate vessel. The
            coarse will promptly fall down to the bottom of the first vessel,
            but the one which will have come from the troubled water, set apart,
            having settled, will be very fine. And then, if it does not have
            enough bond, grind it quite dry on porphyry, &amp; you will render
            it impalpable, &amp; which will have bond like chalk. Then, if it
            seems right to you, you will reheat it &amp; again will grind it
            &amp; mix it with salts, or linen, <sup>or</sup> burnt felt, or
            ashes of paper &amp; similarly washed things.</p>

    <h2 id="searching-for-the-sand">Searching for the Sand</h2>
    <p>Intrigued by the mention of still identifiable locations around Toulouse,
        professor of art history at Université Toulouse-Jean Jaurès Pascal
        Julien went searching for the “Toulouse sand” in April 2015. Taking his
        cue from fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/87r/f/87r/tl"><span
                  class="underline">87r</span></a> that notes the “usual good
        one” is “found in a vineyard near Puy David, but the one which is most
        excellent is the one from the Touch, near Sainct Michel &amp; toward
        Blagnac, in a vineyard that is quite high up,” Julien began the search.
        Puy David is now Pech David, and “Pech” is an Occitan toponym which
        means a summit. The hill of Pech David (<i><span class="underline">Fig.
                19</span></i>) is a high terrace of sandy clay alluvial deposits
        from the quaternary period which is cut through by the Garonne river
        (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 20</span></i>). The site was fairly
        easy to locate on the Pech David hillside, and the open space of the
        vineyard still existed. Julien collected sand from the cut of a recent
        road following the author-practitioner’s recommendation to collect it
        “from the depths of the earth” (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/84r/f/84r/tl"><span
                  class="underline">84r</span></a>) and to “choose the one which
        is <del>as</del> in clods &amp; lumps, well deep in the earth, for
        usually the one that is found higher up is too much a kin of the earth,
        and the lower is a kin of the rock” (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/87v/f/87v/tl"><span
                  class="underline">87v</span></a>) (<i><span

                is situated southeast of Toulouse, overlooking the city. On fol.
                87r, the author-practitioner notes that “the usual good [sand]

    <p>Making and Knowing Postdoctoral Scholars Jenny Boulboullé, Joel Klein,
        and then Project Manager Jef Palframan reconstructed entries about the
        preparation of Toulouse sand for molding and casting medals in 2015.<a
           href="#fn3"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> They began by comparing the two samples
        of sand received from Pascal Julien, noting that the sand from Touch
        indeed felt finer and fatter. The sand from Puy David was drier, but
        when squeezed in the hand, it clung together (see below, Vid. 5). This
        is the “squeeze test,” as it was known in the Making and Knowing Lab,
        because the author-practitioner notes several times in different entries
        that the sand will be ready for molding when it “gives a good hold,
        nevertheless coming apart easily” (e.g., fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/118v/f/118v/tl"><span

    <p>In their first reconstruction, they worked with Puy David sand, relying
        mainly on the entry entitled simply “Sand” on fol. <a

        <p>One can find an excellent one on the little hill of Puy David near
            Thoulouse for lead, tin &amp; copper. It does not want to be too
            much reheated because, drying out all at once, it loses its bond
            &amp; burns at the first arrival of metal, which makes the work
            lumpy &amp; not neat. It is better to reheat from a distance, rather
            than with a straw flame, which generates <del>some</del> some filth.
            Before filling in the frame, you can put in the finest sand you have
            in a very fine linen, &amp; dry pounce the medal and then the

        mortar (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 26)</span></i>, grinding some
        until it was very fine (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 27</span></i>).
        They did not heat the sand before packing their mold frames because, as
        the passage warns, “It does not want to be too much reheated because,

        you have in a very fine linen, &amp; dry pounce the medal,” they placed
        the medal model for molding on the work space inside the frame mold,
        then pounced very finely ground brick powder through cheesecloth
        directly onto the medal. They ground some of the sand from Puy David in
        a mortar, mixed the sand with a small amount of apple cider vinegar
        (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 28</span></i>) and started packing the
        frame mold. The recipe specifies: “then the moistened sand that you put
        on top, which has more body, will grip it.” They observed that the
        moistened sand did indeed hold tight to the pounced brick powder. As
        they worked to pack the mold, they used both ground and unground Puy
        David sand. Because they were able to crush the sand quite finely with
        their fingers without grinding, they ground the sand in the mortar
        fairly briefly. Afterwards, they realized they should have passed the
        sand through a sieve, as almost all casting sand instructions in Ms. Fr.
        640 note. The sand felt very grainy with some larger chunks that could
        mostly be crushed simply pressing with the fingers. When they lifted the
        frame mold from the surface of the workspace, the medal remained on the
        surface, thus they decided to make a one-sided cast in the open frame
        mold. After leaving the frame mold to dry overnight in the fume hood,
        they attempted casting, which did not succeed.</p>

    <p>Learning from their experience, they tried again. This time, Jenny and
        Joel first pounced a thin layer of powdered charcoal over the medal (as
        instructed elsewhere in the manuscript) (<i><span class="underline">Fig.

        reading that reconstruction can engender: by this time, Jenny had
        noticed the ubiquity of the term “impalpable,” used several times in the
        manuscript, including in the Toulouse Sand entries, to denote the
        aimed-for texture of the sand for molding.<a href="#fn5"

            mixed with common earth, but three or 4 feet below &amp; the closest
            to the <em>tuf</em> or stone. Since it comes out in large lumps one
            would say that it starts to take shape as a stone. But when it is
            wet, it comes apart easily. One needs to make sure that when
            breaking it up it is quite granular, &amp; that when crushed between
            the fingers, it renders itself into very great subtlety, <del>like

            without muddying the fingers like clay.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>In this passage, he first writes
        “impalpable” to describe the natural sand, but changes his mind and
        crosses it out to make clear that the sand actually retains a “sandy
        asperity,” thus is not quite impalpable. Yet, it is also not so fine nor
        so fat as to muddy the fingers on handling. The “asperity” of the sand
        becomes a way to test for the exact texture of impalpability, as when
        the author-practitioner instructs on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/68v/f/68v/tl"><span
                  class="underline">68v</span></a>, to grind a molding substance
        until “when putting it on your fingernail, you find it soft without any
        asperity.” Another instance is on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/84v/f/84v/tl"><span
                  class="underline">84v</span></a>, when he notes that in one of
        his artificial sands (made of “the bone of oxen feet”) that it was
        “thoroughly burned &amp; pulverized &amp; ground on porphyry, until it
        is not felt between your fingers,” which forms a good definition of
        “impalpable,” and is actually very close to the “unfeelable” contained
        in Cotgrave’s early seventeenth-century <em>Dictionarie of the French
            and English Tongues</em>, as well that in the <em>Oxford English
            Dictionary</em> (<em>OED</em>) today: “Incapable of being felt by
        the organs of touch; imperceptible to the touch; intangible. Said of
        things immaterial; also, of very fine powder, in which no grit is
        perceptible when it is rubbed between the fingers.” The first use of it
        in English cited in the <em>OED</em>, from 1509, refers to the celestial
        realm: “Though that aungell be invysyble, Inpalpable, and also
        celestiall (S. Hawes, <em>Pastime of Pleasure</em> (1845) xxiii. 106).
        This figurative use occurs more frequently in later centuries, according
        to the <em>OED</em>, and denotes a mental process: “Incapable of being
        (readily) grasped or apprehended by the mind; producing no definite
        mental impression; ‘intangible’.” The more usual use in the late
        sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries was in reference to powders,
        including by Hugh Plat in his <em>Jewell House of Art and Nature</em>
        (London, 1594), cited in the <em>OED</em>: “So subtiliated..as that it
        becam almost an impalpable powder” (p. 88).<a href="#fn6"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Other technical writers also use
        impalpability to denote the best consistency for molding sand, including
        Vannoccio Biringuccio in his 1540 <em>Pirotechnia</em> where he notes
        “The goodness of all these depends on three things; namely, on receiving
        the metall well, on being so fine as to be almost impalpable
        [<em>impalpabile</em> in Biringuccio’s original Italian], and on their
        being made with a magistry that renders them hard and strong when they
        are dry.”<a href="#fn7"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> The pseudonymous Alessio Piemontese’s
        <em>I Secreti</em> also refers to the desired consistency of sands as
        impalpable.<a href="#fn8"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
    <p>The author-practitioner is also concerned with impalpability, but notes
        that the impalpable sand he seeks still retains the “bond of earth”:
        “Next, they grind it dry on porphyry. And thus it becomes as if
        impalpable and not too dried out, <del>it</del> and it retains the body
        &amp; the bond of the earth to which it is kin and is better than when
        it is so burnt” (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/87v/f/87v/tl"><span
                  class="underline">87v</span></a>). He is aiming for an
        artificial sand that is impalpable, but not too lean, or dry, even after
        being heated, and still retains “the body &amp; bond of the earth.”<a
           href="#fn9"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
    <p>The realization that “impalpable” was a technical term informed Jenny and
        Joel’s actions as they now ground the Puy David sand vigorously and
        thoroughly to obtain that desired quality of intangibility, of not being
        “felt between your fingers.”</p>
    <p>In this trial, they followed up the laborious grinding by adding vinegar
        to both the fine, impalpable sand and the packing sand (<i><span
                  class="underline">Fig. 30</span></i>) because the
        author-practitioner, after first recommending glair (egg white), which
        he noted “releases <del>very neatly <em>M</em></del> very neatly in low
        relief, but not for figures in high relief,” he subsequently remarks
        that using vinegar for both the fine sand and the packing sand will
        release the model and the cast better:</p>

            </em> with moistening it only with very strong vinegar. It released
            a figure which I could not release previously. And I believe that,

            coarsest, for filling, with gushes of salt water or wine, that they
            do not join so well. But as they are of one nature &amp; are
            moistened the same, they embrace each other &amp; hold together one
            with the other (fol. <a

                      class="underline">87v</span></a>).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>He regards the easier release as caused by
        unification of the fine and coarser sands into one nature when they are
        both moistened with vinegar, thus bonding (“they embrace each other
        &amp; hold together”) tightly together instead of breaking apart when
        the mold is opened.</p>
    <p>He completes this section by admonishing further that “For molding well,
        after having prepared your sands, mold in a day. Slowly reheat them the
        next day, then cast them on another.”</p>
    <p>After mixing the sand together with the vinegar, Jenny and Joel pounced a
        thick layer of impalpable Puy David sand (<i><span

        brick powder they had used in their first trial), then they filled the
        mold frame with somewhat less finely ground packing sand, making sure to
        pass it through a sieve (<i><span class="underline">Vid. 2</span></i>)
        as they filled the casting flask and gently compacted it with a mallet
        (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 31</span></i>).</p>

    <p>In 2016 Joel Klein and Tianna Uchacz carried out a third reconstruction
        that compared the Puy David and Touch sands.<a href="#fn10"

           id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> They cast a bronze medal in Puy David
        sand and a tin-lead medal in the “fine and fatty” Touch sand. They made
        several changes to the 2015 process, as they relied on fol. <a

                  class="underline">84r</span></a> that “It wants to be, like
        all natural sand, well reheated before putting it to use. One pulverizes
        it, because it is in lumps, then one reheats it in a copper kettle or
        similar thing, until<em>
            <del>l</del>
        </em> it no longer smokes.” After heating the sand in an open metal pie
        plate on a hot plate on the highest setting for about four hours, the
        sand had turned a dark brown (<i><span class="underline">Fig.
                37</span></i>). They then roasted the finely ground pouncing
        sand with a torch.</p>

    <p>The medal used as a pattern for the mold was laid out in one half of the
        casting flask resting on a large baking sheet with a large trapezoidal
        piece of beeswax adjacent to the top side to serve as the eventual gate.
        Two approximately one-inch lengths of halved chopsticks were placed at
        the five- and seven-o’clock positions, branching off of the bottom of
        the medal to allow the air to escape when the mold fills with metal
        during casting (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 38</span></i>).</p>

    <p>Finely-ground charcoal was then placed in cheesecloth to pounce a light
        layer of charcoal dust across the surface of the medal and the casting
        infrastructure. Extremely finely-ground impalpable Puy David sand was
        pounced in cheesecloth over the charcoal layer in greater quantity,
        until details of the objects beneath were no longer discernible
        (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 39</span></i>). The recently roasted
        Puy David sand was ground in an electric coffee grinder to ensure a
        uniform fineness, then it was hand blended in a glass bowl with splashes
        of live apple cider vinegar until it achieved a consistency whereby the
        wet sand could be squeezed into handful-sized clumps that could be made
        to crumble by pinching between the fingers and thumb (the “squeeze
        test”) (<i><span class="underline">Vid. 5</span></i>). This wet sand
        mixture was used to fill the remainder of the first half of the casting
        flask. It was pressed in and compacted with the flat surface of a rubber
        mallet and eventually leveled with the long handle of a wooden spoon.
        Excess wet sand was swept away and removed from the baking sheet
        (returning it to the bowl of wet sand). The flask and baking sheet were
        held together and inverted, then the baking sheet was put back beneath
        the now inverted first half of the flask.</p>

    <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The study of Toulouse sand yielded many insights into Ms. Fr. 640 and its
        author-practitioner. The realization that the manuscript was closely
        associated with Toulouse came especially in the sections that refer to
        the sand of Toulouse, and this link was strengthened when Pascal Julien
        went in search of the sand, finding it just where the
        author-practitioner had recommended. This intriguing discovery provided
        a physical demonstration of the text, showing the authenticity of the
        author-practitioner’s firsthand experiences of obtaining sand from the
        environs of Toulouse, and it highlighted a remarkable continuity of the
        historical landscape.</p>
    <p>Despite the Making and Knowing Team’s relative lack of experience in the
        casting trials, the author-practitioner’s observations about the
        different characteristics of the two Toulouse sands tallied with Team
        members’ experiences with the sands in the Making and Knowing Lab.
        Additionally, the Making and Knowing Team’s molding and casting trials
        demonstrated proof of concept for the author-practitioner’s belief in
        the excellent potential of the natural sands of Toulouse for molding
        (<i><span class="underline">Vid. 9</span></i>).<a href="#fn11"

    <p>These reconstructions were especially fruitful in demonstrating how the
        iterative process of reconstruction can yield new insights into a text
        of practice. Such work requires reading the text closely, trying the
        process (often failing), then returning to closely read and study the
        text again, from which new insights—such as the technical meaning of
        “impalpable”—inform new reconstruction trials. This back-and-forth
        process between text and materials can continue many times, as the close
        reading and workshop trials mutually inform each other in the gradual
        process of interpreting a practical text.</p>

                <p>Natural sands are still of interest today for foundry
                    processes. Researchers tested natural sands in Nigeria for
                    foundry uses, using the America Foundry Society’s standards
                    for casting suitability: Katsina Christopher Balai and
                    Reyazul Haque Khan, “Characterization of Beach/River Sand
                    for Foundry Application,” <em>Leonardo Journal of
                        Sciences</em>, 23 (2013): 77-83. As historical
                    descriptions of locatable natural sands for casting are
                    rare, it would be of interest to have the two Toulouse sands
                    evaluated according to official American Foundry Society
                    standards.<a href="#fnref11"
