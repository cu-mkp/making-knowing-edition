            <p>The recovery of the ancient Greco-Roman world was a defining
                feature of what we call the “Renaissance.” This essay explores

    <p>The author-practitioner engages in a defining question of Renaissance
        Europe: had the height of civilization already been reached in
        antiquity, or did humans still have the potential to innovate and to
        improve upon the past? Legendary ancient inventions, such as the burning
        mirror that Archimedes supposedly aimed from afar at the ships of his
        city’s enemies, set goals for modern discoverers (<i><u>Fig. 1</u></i>).<a href="#fn1"

    <p>Throughout the manuscript, the author-practitioner joins this old contest
        with antiquity. Yet, his case sets the competition between ancients and
        moderns in a new light. We often think about the debate between the
        ancients and moderns as a wide-ranging but primarily scholarly debate.
        The author-practitioner shows that this dynamic could also be found in a
        more craft-oriented world.</p>
    <p>Somewhat surprisingly, the author-practitioner leans on the power of
        ancient knowledge in justifying the publication of his book. In notes
        that he gathered for his planned publication, which he may have intended
        to call <em>The Workshop</em> (La Boutique), he began by recording a
        snippet drawn from an ancient source that would seem to champion the
        ability of the ancients over the moderns. “It can be gathered from the
        words of Herodotus that the navigation of the Portuguese was not newly
        invented by them as they brag” (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/162r/f/162r/tl"><u>162r</u></a>).
    </p>
    <p>The author-practitioner anticipated that his book would be criticized for
        offering no new knowledge. He turned to the ancients for his defense. On
        fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/166r/f/166r/tl"><u>166r</u></a>,
        adapting a classical quotation from Terence, that “nothing has been said
        that has not been said or done before,” he suggested that it was in any
        case impossible to do anything new. Although he was not “able to invent
        anything new” he could “rediscover anew the books of Numa, buried &amp;
        long unknown &amp; forgotten, in order to publish them for those who do
        not know them” (<i><u>Fig. 2</u></i>).</p>

    <p>According to Pliny, the legendary second king of Rome, Numa Pompilius,
        had preserved his wisdom for future generations by smearing his books
        with cedar oil and burying them before his death in order to be
        discovered again. In the late sixteenth century, the books of Numa
        featured among the <em>deperdita</em> or lost ancient things as both a
        collection of all the most desirable forms of ancient knowledge as well
        as a symbol of the entire idea that ancient knowledge was just waiting
        to be recovered.<a href="#fn2"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref2"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> Numa’s books encapsulated the
        idea that rediscovery of old things was just as wonderful and valuable
        as the discovery of the new.</p>
    <p>Elsewhere, the author-practitioner presents particular techniques as the
        recovery of lost ancient knowledge. For example, a technique for concave
        mirrors would allow for constructing the legendary burning mirrors of
        Archimedes (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/5v/f/5v/tl"><u>5v</u></a>).
        Some believed that the white crust that formed on carnelian “is a secret
        of ancient lapidaries that is lost” (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/13r/f/13r/tl"><u>13r</u></a>).
        Glassmakers “do not have the invention for making a perfect red in a
        work which one needs to reheat” (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/32v/f/32v/tl"><u>32v</u></a>).
        Making red glass out of colloidal gold suspended in solution was indeed
        a difficult, multi-step process known to few (<i><u>Fig. 3</u></i>). The
        author-practitioner did not explicitly refer to this as a lost ancient
        work, although when the process became widespread in the late
        seventeenth century, it was considered a lost ancient invention found
        again.<a href="#fn3"

    <p>From these examples, it would seem that the author-practitioner
        envisioned his practice as participating in a recovery of ancient, lost
        knowledge. However, there are other points when the author-practitioner
        does not connect objects widely considered to be lost to this movement
        for the recovery of lost knowledge. For example, the author-practitioner
        treats asbestos as an excellent item to powder and add to sand for
        casting (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/149r/f/149r/tl"><u>149r</u></a>).
        Among the learned, asbestos and asbestine (cloth made of asbestos) were
        renowned as lost ancient substances. As Guido Pancirolli wrote in his
        <em>Two Books of Memorable Things Lost and Things Found,</em> asbestos
        was “nowhere to be had now.”<a href="#fn4"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref4"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
    <p>Yet, Pancirolli was wrong about this. Neither asbestos nor asbestine was
        in fact lost; the commentator on Pancirolli’s book pointed out examples
        of both that could be seen in princely cabinets of curiosity and as an
        item regularly produced on Mediterranean islands.<a href="#fn5"

    <p>Giambattista della Porta (1535–1615) pointed out in the mid-sixteenth
        century that asbestos was “spun by every woman almost, if she be not
        ignorant of it.”<a href="#fn7"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref7"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> The reputation of asbestos as
        lost among scholars at the same time that it was in fact widely
        available, points to the extent to which scholars were not well
        acquainted with craft materials. At times they carried on debates over
        the loss of ancient materials while remaining ignorant about the current
        availability of those same objects. The author-practitioner suffered no
        such misconceptions. When it came to available materials such as
        asbestos, he did not even mention the debate about whether asbestos was
        lost or not.</p>
    <p>Electrum was another material that the author-practitioner discusses as a
        modern, rather than as a lost material. He describes a certain “base
        gold” found naturally in German as electrum on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/149r/f/149r/tl"><u>149r</u></a>.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>One calls it gold from the Rhine, which one finds in the rivers, and
            is spangle gold. Goldsmiths from Germany wanted to refine it,
            thinking to separate it from this whiteness, which they deemed to be
            silver. But it always remains whiteish, which demonstrates that this
            whiteness is fixed, &amp; it does not lack color. This is electrum,
            from which one can make cups which will demonstrate poison.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>Although the author-practitioner does not
        refer to the ancients, his description of electrum harkens all the way
        back to how Pliny the Elder (23–79 CE) described electrum in his
        <em>Natural History</em>. To Pliny, electrum was either an artificial
        amalgam of gold and silver, or a naturally occurring metal that, made
        into cups, could reveal the presence of poison by forming an iridescent
        rainbow and emitting a crackling noise. Over a thousand years, writers
        repeated Pliny’s description of electrum’s powers.<a href="#fn8"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref8"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
    <p>For many, rediscovery of the ancient form of electrum promised great
        powers. According to a work attributed to Paracelsus (1493–1541),
        alchemists of his time had lost the true, ancient meaning of the term
        <em>electrum</em>. Ancient electrum, according to him, was neither gold
        nor silver, nor any other naturally occurring metal, but rather the name
        for any metal made by art that differs from the metal from which it
        came.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>The ancients called Electrum by its proper name; the moderns falsely
            call it silver. The ancients were not losers, because they knew the
            Electrum itself; the moderns, because they have no knowledge of
            Electrum, throw away their faculties, labour, and time.<a
               href="#fn9"
               class="footnote-ref"
               id="fnref9"
               role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>The ancients possessed a technique for
        compounding an electrum in particular proportions of different metals so
        that the resulting substance had wonderful properties, such as the
        ability to reveal the presence of this poison. For this reason, “our
        ancestors used to have their drinking-cups, dishes, and other utensils”
        made of electrum. Many small ancient objects made of electrum were
        buried and later dug up, but few understood what they were (<i><u>Fig. 5</u></i>). This, complained Paracelsus, was “a mark of the
        ignorance of our age that it cares nothing for such objects as these.”<a

    <p>Electrum became one of the famous lost things of antiquity.<a

           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref11"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> Blaise de Vigenère (1523–1596)
        connected electrum to the artificial production of ruby glass using
        gold, the lost technique that the author-practitioner also discussed.
        This preparation of gold, he said, was the “true electrum of the
        ancients,” and it could also be used to make cups and vessels that would
        reveal the presence of poison.<a href="#fn12"

           role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
    <p>Although the author-practitioner’s description of electrum seems to share
        so much with these accounts of the “true electrum of the ancients,” to
        him, it seemed a piece of knowledge drawn not from ancient sources, but
        from contemporary German craftsmen.<a href="#fn13"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref13"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> He describes electrum in the
        midst of several reports concerning German craft techniques. Although
        electrum has wonderful properties of revealing poison, his account
        suggests that it was widely available in contemporary Germany and had no
        need to be recovered from the past. The account of electrum as a
        naturally occurring silvery gold that could reveal the presence of
        poison had been circulating around Europe for so long that it appears to
        have become a piece of common knowledge, disconnected from discussions
        of the ancient world.</p>
    <p>Like other craftspeople, the author-practitioner was not entirely cut off
        from ancient learning. The idea of rediscovering ancient lost techniques
        occurs throughout his manuscript. Ancient beliefs about materials such
        as electrum had also spread so widely over centuries that they became
        incorporated into common lore, sometimes even disconnected from their
        “ancient” identity.</p>
    <p>In addition to his immersion in this craft knowledge about antiquity, the
        author-practitioner actively reached out to more text-based notions of
        the Renaissance. For the preface to his planned publication, he tried to
        present his collection of techniques as a recovery of ancient knowledge
        in ways that would appeal to a more learned audience. Yet, his
        engagement with this learned version of the Renaissance, as a response
        to anticipated criticism, could also seem fairly superficial and
        instrumental. The disconnection between how the author-practitioner and
