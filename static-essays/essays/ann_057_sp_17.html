    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
    <p>Ms. Fr. 640 contains forty recipes that can be categorized as medical or
        therapeutic. They present medical knowledge from a layperson’s
        perspective and do not reflect standard formulas, nor do they derive
        from authoritative medical texts. Rather, they can be viewed as
        belonging to a broader category of “books of secrets” or “how-to books.”
        William Eamon distinguishes “books of secrets” from household recipe
        books, noting that “alchemy occupies a more prominent place in the books
        of secrets,” even while “books of secrets represented themselves as
        serving natural philosophical ends as well as utility.”<a href="#fn1"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref1"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> Pamela Smith argues that artisans
        formulated a “vernacular science” through their bodily engagement with
        natural materials—which she has termed an “artisanal epistemology.” This
        artisanal way of knowing, formed through the experience of transforming
        matter and imitating nature, can be seen as parallel to Eamon’s “natural
        philosophical ends.”<a href="#fn2"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref2"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> The significance of artisanal
        work, then, is not only utilitarian in its production of things, but can
        foster a “new philosophy” of knowing through observing, experimenting,
        and making. This point has been well demonstrated in the Making and
        Knowing Project’s laboratory investigations into metalwork, moldmaking,
        and colormaking.<a href="#fn3"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref3"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> How, then, do the medical recipes
        fit into this interpretation of the manuscript as an articulation of
        artisanal epistemology?</p>
    <p>The existence of medical recipes in “books of secrets” or “how-to books,”
        as Pamela Smith points out, was related to the pre-modern thinking that
        took materials in artisans’ work, such as minerals and metals, as
        entities understood on the model of the human body, which had to be
        brought into a “balanced” and “healthy” state by purging and
        tempering.<a href="#fn4"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref4"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> The
        Hippocratic-Galenic-Aristotelian view of nature as constituted by
        opposing elements that must be brought into a healthy state of balance
        runs through all the types of recipes.<a href="#fn5"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref5"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> Apart from this connection
        between medical and metallurgical work, do the medical recipes play any
        other role in this “book of secrets”?</p>
    <p>In medical recipes, the curative effect always matters. This essay begins
        by examining the author-practitioner’s medical recipes for their
        perceived virtues in curing illness, relieving suffering, and
        maintaining well-being, which emphasizes their practical nature in early
        modern medical culture. From this perspective, I focus on how illness
        was understood in contemporary terms before turning to discuss the
        material ingredients of specific medical recipes. (See Table 2.) I also
        investigate the ingredients of the manuscript’s medical recipes,
        discussing whether they were common or unusual within Ms. Fr. 640. I
        must leave aside research on the efficacy, availability, and popularity
        of these ingredients, as it lies beyond the scope of my investigation. I
        summarize my findings in an exploration of the disease landscape in
        early modern France through the lens of the manuscript. Overall, this
        essay seeks to contextualize the author-practitioner’s collection of
        medical recipes within a network of vernacular knowledge transmission in
        early modern Europe.</p>

        Overview of Medical Recipes in Ms. Fr. 640: Ailments and Ingredients
    </h2>
    <p>Medical recipes in Ms. Fr. 640 do not stand out. This is because they are
        scattered through the manuscript and are not clearly distinguishable
        from other types of entries in the text. To address this, the Appendix
        (at the end of this essay) gathers together the manuscript’s “medical
        recipes.” The author-practitioner’s recipes include remedies that belong
        to what we today call therapeutic and preventive medicine, although it
        is important to keep in mind that our modern understanding about medical
        practices differs from the author-practitioner’s understanding of health
        and illness. These recipes also contain diverse information about diet,
        cosmetics, and religious conduct, among other subjects, which sheds
        light on how people dealt with their quotidian bodily sufferings (and in
        some cases, beautification). These entries also illuminate the
        transmission of vernacular medical knowledge in early modern France, and
        by extension, Europe.</p>
    <p>I examined forty medical recipes in the manuscript, detailed in the
        Appendix, all of which either treat different health and physical
        problems, or use substances that claim to have a curative effect. These
        recipes appear in noticeable groupings with other medical entries, such
        as on <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/7v/f/7v/tl"><u>7v</u></a>,
        <a

           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/47v/f/47v/tl"><u>47v</u></a>,
        and <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/103r/f/103r/tl"><u>103r</u></a>–<a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/103v/f/103v/tl"><u>103v</u></a>,
        or in entries devoted to other subjects, such as those on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/46r/f/46r/tl"><u>46r</u></a>–<a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/47r/f/47r/tl"><u>47r</u></a>
        that use oil of sulfur, or fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/79r/f/79r/tl"><u>79r</u></a>,
        which contains an “Antidote against the fumes of metals” that is
        followed by two metalworking recipes using tin and antimony. Medical
        entries are characterized by headings that indicate a bodily affliction,
        a hazardous environment, such as noxious air or smoke from metals, or a
        central ingredient. The recipes themselves generally feature concise
        information about the ingredients, processes, and methods of
        application.</p>
    <h2 id="ailments">Ailments</h2>
    <p>The practical nature of the medical recipes in Ms. Fr. 640 is indicated
        by the three broad categories into which the wide range of ailments
        appear to fall: 1) illness and suffering, 2) disease, and 3) hazardous
        circumstances (see Table 1 below). Entries that fall under “illness and
        suffering” are characterized by such descriptions as uneasy stomach,
        toothache, pain, black eye, and red face, and thus include symptom-based
        ailments. Those under the category of “disease” span a wide range of
        specifically named ailments (such as gout or gonorrhea). “Hazardous
        circumstances” relate to the exposure to health-threatening environments
        within an artisan’s workshop (for example, metal fumes or noxious air).
    </p>
    <p>However, these diseases must not be confused with modern biomedical
        terms; rather, they represent a social consensus that framed a group of
        symptoms into a “name” understandable to both medical practitioners and
        laypeople.<a href="#fn6"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref6"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> For this reason, medical
        historians often find it difficult to make sense of early modern
        historical disease terms and concepts.<a href="#fn7"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref7"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> Even when contemporaries wrote
        down their symptoms and bodily afflictions, they used concepts laden
        with cultural meanings that are not readily apparent to modern
        readers.<a href="#fn8"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref8"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> It would thus be anachronistic to
        attempt a retrospective diagnosis of the ailments in Ms. Fr. 640 by
        seeking out modern equivalents.</p>

    <p>The medical recipes listed in Table 1 are practical: they include no
        theoretical explanation of the disease type, nor information about how
        the medicine works to cure. The practical nature of these medical
        recipes does not necessarily imply that the author-practitioner was
        ignorant of medical theory. Indeed, he occasionally uses the language of
        humoral theory, mentioning remedies to clear “phlegm and gas,” and he
        also has a concept of vapor as a cause of “stomach colic.”<a href="#fn9"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref9"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
    <p>Humoral theory constituted an authoritative explanation of disease in
        early modern Europe. Based on Hippocratic and Galenic traditions, the
        standard medical view of the human body was understood through the
        workings of four humors (blood, yellow bile, black bile and phlegm),
        which built upon Aristotelian notions about the composition of nature by
        four elements (earth, air, fire and water), paired with four qualities
        (hot, cold, wet and dry). An excess or deficiency of any of these four
        humors caused malfunction in the internal workings of the body. In this
        system, medical cures aimed to restore humoral balance by eliminating
        excess or correcting a deficiency or insufficiency. Bloodletting,
        purging, and expectorants were frequently administered to this end.<a
           href="#fn10"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref10"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> The absence of bloodletting
        therapy in Ms. Fr. 640 does not necessarily suggest that the practice or
        the associated humoral theory was not popular among artisans but more
        probably indicates that bloodletting had already become
        professionalized.<a href="#fn11"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref11"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> The medical recipes in the
        manuscript, on the contrary, are practical therapeutics intended to be
        used in household care or self-administered therapy.</p>
    <p>Medical historian Michael Stolberg discusses the perception and
        experience of the body and its diseases among craftsmen, maidservants
        and paid sickbed attendants.<a href="#fn12"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref12"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> By examining a sixteenth-century
        German physician’s casebook, Stolberg ascertains that neither the
        specific disease terms nor the imbalance of the four humors in the body
        were referred to in the physician’s practice. Instead, this physician
        adopted many vernacular phrases and expressions about disease in his
        interactions with his patients and their families.<a href="#fn13"
           class="footnote-ref"

           role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> Not surprisingly, the ailments
        in Ms. Fr. 640 are similar to those discussed by Stolberg. The
        author-practitioner’s inclusion of medical recipes in his manuscript
        thus provides a valuable source to probe early modern artisanal views of
        illness and disease. I will come back to this important point after a
        brief survey of the medical ingredients in Ms. Fr. 640, which provides
        another perspective for understanding the nature of the medical recipes
        in the manuscript.</p>
    <h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
    <p>The author-practitioner uses eighty-three different ingredients in the
        forty medical recipes that I identified. These can be largely
        categorized into three groups: 1) plant matter, 2) foodstuffs and drink,
        and 3) minerals, metals, and chemicals. There remain a handful of
        ingredients that do not fit into these categories (see Table 2 below).<a

    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>Synthesis of this information yields
        interesting insights into the relationship between the taxonomy of the
        ingredients and their application. First, twenty-eight recipes—more than
        two thirds of the total—contain foodstuffs as ingredients. This accounts
        for the most widely used group in the manuscript’s medical recipes. On
        the one hand, this is related to the primary role of diet in the
        practice of health maintenance; on the other, comestibles were deemed
        essential to most remedies, especially those for ingestion. This point
        can be further demonstrated by the recipes for stomach ailments, in
        which both plant matter and foodstuffs are included. Notably, in these
        cases, herbaceous plant matter is the primary therapeutic, with
        recommendations that it be taken with some kind of comestible. Also,
        foodstuffs are generally not the main ingredients in a given recipe;
        rather, they are a subordinate therapeutic, sometimes even a special
        agent, likely used to either assist in the ingestion of the primary
        therapeutic, or to serve as a mediating substance in its application. On
        this point, the most outstanding examples are wine,<a href="#fn17"

           class="footnote-ref"

        oil.<a href="#fn23"

           role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
    <p>Second, the ingredients in “Minerals, Metals, Chemicals” appear to be
        mostly for external application and not for ingestion, the exception
        being “Against gonorrhea” on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/7v/f/7v/tl"><u>7v</u></a>
        (a recipe for an injectable therapeutic water). Most of them are either
        paired with plant matter, foodstuffs, or both, and some are prepared by
        such relatively complex processes as filtration and distillation. Lead
        is an exception. It is applied externally in the entry for eye- and
        face-related problems on fols. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/66v/f/66v/tl"><u>66v</u></a>
        and <a

    <p>The use of oil of sulfur in certain medical recipes is a noteworthy
        example that complicates the boundaries between my categories. The
        ingredients described as “oil” can contain materials from both
        foodstuffs and minerals, pointing to flexibility in the taxonomy. Oil of
        sulfur is not actually an “oil” but sulfuric acid, according to modern
        terminology. That said, it fits into the author-practitioner’s
        definition of “oil” in “Extraction of oils” on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/29v/f/29v/tl"><u>29v</u></a>:
        “apothecaries say that anything which does not adhere to the mortar
        while pestling is oleaginous.” This practical definition captures the
        diverse nature of “oil” in terms of its various working properties.</p>
    <p>Oil of sulfur was produced by heating sulfur to a high temperature while
        gathering the vapor in a distillation apparatus.<a href="#fn26"

           id="fnref26"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a> In the manuscript, oil of sulfur
        was either ingested or applied externally. Only a small amount of oil of
        sulfur (measured by drops) was added in each recipe, suggesting the

        antimony oil, which is located on fol. 47r immediately following the
        group of recipes about oil of sulfur. Fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/47r/f/47r/tl"><u>47r</u></a>
        is dominated by medical recipes, but the entry for oil of antimony does
        not indicate any therapeutic uses. To conclude this section, the
        ingredients in the medical recipes both introduce new materials to the
        manuscript, e.g., herbaceous plants, and reveal that the medicinal
        applications of foodstuffs, metals, minerals, and chemicals are used in
        other kinds of artisanal works. My analysis in this section sheds light
        upon both the distinct nature of ingredients within a category and their
        potential to blur modern taxonomic boundaries.</p>

    <p>The following section shifts attention from a consideration of medical
        theory to its practical application in the manuscript’s medical recipes.
        Here, I connect early modern disease types to specific entries in Ms.
        Fr. 640 by looking at the author-practitioner’s discussions of
        infectious diseases (specifically plague and dysentery) as well as
        various forms of stomach ailments. This latter category encompasses such
        broad topics as dietary regime and particular remedies for specific
        ailments, such as oil of sulfur.</p>
    <h2 id="disease-plague-and-dysentery">Disease: Plague and Dysentery</h2>
    <p>The author-practitioner provides two entries for plague in the
        manuscript. Plague epidemics continuously struck the French population
        throughout the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.<a href="#fn29"

        said to be “a secret.” Theriac was a complex compound used as a

        derived from opium) either soaked in plant extractions from scabious and
        bugloss (common European plants) or in diluted wine. This particular
        recipe relates to other early modern cures that employ opiate, alcohol,

    <p>The other disease entity included in the manuscript is dysentery
        (<em>dysentherie</em>) on fol. 47r. The following detailed description
        of its symptoms comes from the sixteenth-century French physician
        Laurent Joubert: “a pain in the belly resulting from the excoriation of
        the inside of the bowels to such a degree that scrapings and blood, and
        sometimes mire and pus, will exit. The pain is most severe and drives
        one to return often to stool, where one is able to do nothing or very
        little.”<a href="#fn33"

            <em>symphytum</em>, also called <em>consolida maior</em>. And if it

    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>Interestingly, the author-practitioner
        appears to understand dysentery and diarrhea as related diseases,
        evidenced in his use of the same herb, “<em>symphytum</em>,” to treat
        both ailments. For diarrhea, this herb is ingested in the form of a
        preserve. For dysentery, the root of this herb is combined with a
        concoction of beef, which, “then boiled, rejoins them,” as if rejoining
        the cuts in the beef worked analogously to healing the excoriation of
        the stomach. <em>Symphytum</em> is also known as <em>Consolida

        having a healthy stomach and thus maintaining good health. The
        Florentine artist Pontormo (1494–1557) kept a diary on his diet, which

    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>As Stolberg points out, the stomach and
        the liver dominated the physician’s explanation of diseases when
        treating patients. They are the two major organs where food and drink
        are digested, transformed and assimilated into the body’s substance. In
        early modern medical understanding, an insufficient transformation
        during concoction due to stomach weakness would generate viscous phlegm
        or mucus and other harmful matter.<a href="#fn39"

        medicine regarded the stomach as the key organ for the digestive

        “good wine” and then filtered, which is also “an excellent cure against
        suffocation of the matrix.” This phrase may strike the modern reader as
        strange. However, suffocation of the matrix, also known as fits of the
        mother, was actually one of the most commonly diagnosed female diseases
        in the sixteenth century. It often manifested as an “impediment of
        actions,” “difficulty in respiration” and unfortunate “behavior” of

        sickness and cold gout. These recipes, which are part of the group of
        oil of sulfur recipes between fols. 46r and 46v, use oil of sulfur as an
        ingredient. Notably, Paracelsus also grouped these two diseases together
        as he believe they have a similar nature and cure, oil of vitriol, which
        is the same as Ms. Fr. 640’s oil of sulfur.<a href="#fn51"

    <p>Known as <em>epilepsie</em> in Greek, a person who suffers from the
        falling sickness loses consciousness and falls to the ground. From
        antiquity, it was widely believed that a person suffering from this
        disease was possessed by a demon, thus necessitating religious or
        magical intervention to treat it. Galen identified three types of
        falling sickness, all related to brain malfunction, believing the
        disease to either originate in the brain itself or to have been
        transmitted from other parts of the body. Paracelsus, on the other hand,
        related falling sickness to environmental stimuli.<a href="#fn52"

        other hand, explained gout with his concept of disease as a specific
        matter in the body—the “tartar”—which originates in food, is released
        through digestion, and is given shape by the solidifying and coagulating
        nature of the “action of salt.”<a href="#fn58"

        that “gonorrhea” in early modern Europe did not describe a bacterial,
        sexually transmitted infection as it is understood today, rather, it was
        “a catch-all term for the discharge of semen and other fluids,” which
        was remedied by the injection of liquid preparations,<a href="#fn61"

        This concept is rooted in Galenic medicine, and the Greek for gonorrhea,
        γονόρροια, means “flow of seed.” It was understood to be an involuntary
        emission of semen resulting from improper diet, fatigue, and sexual
        excess.<a href="#fn62"

        Information from the “Medical Periphery”</h2>
    <p>This essay began with an examination of the medical recipes in Ms. Fr.
        640 through the lens of ailments and ingredients. This section places
        the recipes within a vernacular network of medical knowledge production
        and circulation in early modern Europe, and considers the possible
        routes through which the author-practitioner collected his medical
        information.</p>
    <p>Medical recipes were one type of “technical writing,” records of
        experiential knowledge in the premodern period that were similar in
        different parts of the world and various cultures. Medical historian
        Gianna Pomata has coined the term “epistemic genre” to classify the
        historical texts that record technical procedures and scientific
        practices, which, as vehicles of epistemic projects, directly relate to
        the making and transmission of knowledge. Medical recipes, among other
        types of recipes, are one of the oldest and longest-lasting epistemic
        genres, and are marked by a stable structure and format. However, two
        distinct types of medical recipes can be identified, based on their
        origin and usage: the “formula,” with its established, standardized
        method of preparing medications, conventionally originating from an
        authoritative text, and the “recipe proper,” a tested remedy associated
        with a specific patient.<a href="#fn66"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref66"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>66</sup></a> The two forms of medical recipe
        were interlinked in practice: the formula provided the rule of
        prescription, and once prescribed in an actual case, it could become a
        recipe proper.</p>
    <p>Medical recipes, as a genre of medical writing, refer to medical texts
        that contain records of remedies, often authored by a medical
        practitioner, either compiling information from different textural
        resources or gathering practical knowledge from individual cases.<a
           href="#fn67"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref67"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>67</sup></a> Medical recipes as specific
        texts for medical remedies can be recorded in any kind of book,
        manuscript, pamphlet, manual, correspondence, etc. In this sense,
        medical recipes are not necessarily a collection or reference authored
        by or written for practitioners, but an informal channel for
        communicating and evaluating medical information among laypeople.</p>
    <p>One of the noteworthy examples in early modern Europe is the manuscript
        recipe collection within the household, which generally included both
        prophylactic and curative medicines. Household healthcare was the
        primary arena of medical treatment. Household recipes usually consist
        mostly of cure-alls and medicine for general diseases, while recipes for
        more specific diseases are fewer in number. Generally speaking, a
        medical practitioner would only intervene in case of emergency, fatal
        disease, or after the failure of a household remedy. It is not
        surprising that a large number of the manuscript recipe collections were
        authored by women, since household medical care was considered women’s
        work, and preparing medications was associated with female household
        skills. Such recipe collections were also linked with cookbooks, which
        contained culinary recipes that contributed to healthcare practices by
        supporting dietary regimen. The skills for preparing medical recipes,
        known as “kitchen physick,” required common kitchenware and cooking
        skills, while the ingredients were also regularly available culinary
        materials like spices, wine, vinegar, honey, or herbs available in a
        backyard garden. However, the concept of a household recipe collection
        does not imply that the recipes were confined either to women’s
        expertise or to the domestic sphere. The collection of recipes was a
        collective work that involved the participation of all family members,
        and the circulation stretched out toward the broader context of an early
        modern “medical marketplace,” in which recipes and associated medical
        knowledge circulated as either commodities or gifts through family,
        kinship, friendship, communal ties, and, of course, medical
        consultations. While the collectors tended to acquire information within
        their own social circles, where firsthand credibility could be
        guaranteed, they also extended their collecting practice to broader
        geographical and occupational circles of informants, whose expertise or
        social status could guarantee the recipes they provided.<a href="#fn68"

    <p>Although Ms. Fr. 640 is neither a household collection nor a cookbook, it
        belonged to a vernacular network of knowledge transmission through which
        laypeople shared medical knowledge within their social network to ensure
        health and wellbeing in everyday life and work. It is impossible to know
        exactly how the author-practitioner gathered his medical recipes. But
        there are a few clues that give insight into the author-practitioner’s
        information sources. The salve for burns recipe on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/103r/f/103r/tl"><u>103r</u></a>
        states that “A gunpowder maker who had almost completely burnt himself
        &amp; showed no sign of the burn, taught me this.” The claim about the
        recipe’s efficacy was made on the basis not of professional judgment,
        but on the first hand testimony from a person who likely had much
        experience with burns. He said it had been tried and it worked. On <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/44v/f/44v/tl"><u>44v</u></a>,
        the author-practitioner refers to the excellent plague water of Monsieur
        de Montorsin, almost certainly one César de Montourcin, Master of the
        Toulouse Mint in 1590–91, a consequential citizen of Toulouse, whose
        social status lent weight to the recipe’s credibility.<a href="#fn69"

           id="fnref69"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>69</sup></a></p>
    <p>This pattern of knowledge transmission is common in the manuscript, and
        the author-practitioner often reveals explicitly or implicitly that he
        learned a technique from somewhere or someone, usually from a
        professional artisan or in a place famous for its craft.<a href="#fn70"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref70"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>70</sup></a> Some of the medical recipes
        mention the origin of the remedy, with no indication that the
        author-practitioner had been there in person, suggesting he most
        probably learned of it from travelers or other artisans.<a href="#fn71"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref71"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>71</sup></a> Most of the recipes do not have
        precise measurements of ingredients; instead, flexible and approximating
        terms are used, such as “some,” “a drop,” “a piece,” “a bit of,” and “a
        nutshell.” It suggests the recipes did not come from authoritative texts
        but had a quotidian origin by means of oral transmission or the
        observation of practice. However, two recipes on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/7v/f/7v/tl"><u>7v</u></a>
        and one on fol. <a

        do contain precise measurements, including pounds, ounces, and ℥
        (drams). One of them was written in Latin.<a href="#fn72"

           id="fnref72"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>72</sup></a> It is possible that these
        recipes had a textual origin. The author-practitioner probably did not

    <p>The author-practitioner’s concern was with the recipes’ efficacy. He

    <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>There were an estimated 400 to 600 learned physicians and 2000 to 3000
        surgeons in the whole of sixteenth-century France. Only large towns
        supported concentrations of licensed physicians. Toulouse, where the
        manuscript was probably composed, was one such town. In most provincial
        towns, the number of physicians per 10,000 inhabitants remained three to
        five.<a href="#fn80"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref80"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>80</sup></a></p>
    <p>In addition to the sparse learned practitioners, however, there was
        another system of healing practice that existed outside the “authorized”
        medical profession that was deeply rooted in everyday life and
        vernacular networks of medical knowledge-sharing. Common people
        consulted various kinds of healers to seek remedies for and advice on
        their bodily sufferings and well-being. Besides learned physicians and
        surgeons, there were also quacks, bonesetters, martens, ambulant
        charlatans, itinerant peddlers, remedy vendors, midwives, and
        sorcerer-healers, among others. Although the number of these empirics is
        still unclear, the widespread practice of self-medication in the early
        modern period had already exposed most laypeople to a considerable
        corpus of remedies and medical knowledge.<a href="#fn81"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref81"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>81</sup></a> A late eighteenth-century
        physician described the medical landscape of Josselin, a commune in
        northwest France, as one in which “everyone is a physician: there is no
        one, of either sex, who does not meddle with giving advice to the sick,
        prescribing for them, or forbidding them to accept the most essential
        treatment and the most energetic remedies used in medicine.”<a
           href="#fn82"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref82"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>82</sup></a> This statement aimed to
        criticize the unregulated medical market, but it also gives a snapshot
        of how people in early modern France engaged with medical problems in
        everyday life.</p>
    <p>The dissemination of the medical knowledge of laypeople through familial,
        occupational and geographical networks provides the larger context
        within which the author-practitioner of Ms. Fr. 640 collected medical
        recipes. It was a network in which practical instructions were more
        valuable than theoretical interpretations. It was the efficacy as well
        as the instructions for preparation that mattered most. This context,
        which used to be termed “popular medicine” as a separate realm outside
        the domain of learned medicine, has been recast in recent scholarship as
        the “diffusion of medical knowledge from the centre to the periphery.”<a
           href="#fn83"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref83"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>83</sup></a></p>
    <p>However, the periphery can also become the center in other scenarios.
        Leonardo Fioravanti, a well-known Italian physician, though notorious as
        a charlatan and heterodox among his contemporary academic physicians, is
        worth quoting here for his keen emphasis on experiential knowledge in
        medicine. He ridiculed the bookish physicians and acknowledged the
        experience of illiterate laypeople in curing illness:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>The physicians will study a very pretty theory; they will think they
            find the causes of infirmities and remedies to cure them, and then
            when they come upon some difficult case, they won’t know how to
            bring about a cure… Then truly, some old experienced hag will come
            along, who with the rules of life and an enema will make the fever
            cease, or with some unction will make the pain go away, or with some
            fomentation will make the patient sleep. And in so proceeding, the
            old hag will know more than the physicians.<a href="#fn84"
               class="footnote-ref"
               id="fnref84"
               role="doc-noteref"><sup>84</sup></a></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>Fioravanti considered experience more
        important and useful than theory in true healing practice. The “old hag”
        is not only a foil for a learned physician, but also a metaphor to
        convey that accumulated experience (old) and household health care
        (women’s work) were the origin of practical therapeutics. The best
        learning process, as he recommended, is “to toil at experience and to
        imitate those first ones, who did not know physic, nor any method at
        all, but just had good judgement.”<a href="#fn85"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref85"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>85</sup></a> Learning from experience and by
        imitation, as practical therapeutics demands, is also artisanal work in
        which hands-on engagement with materials is bound up with knowing.</p>

                <p>Here I draw on the demarcation between disease and illness in
                    medical anthropology, in which disease is an <em>etic</em>
                    approach to human suffering defined and diagnosed by
                    doctors, while illness refers to the <em>emic</em> approach
                    that describes how patients and their families experience
                    and deal with the disease process. See Arthur Kleinman,
                    <em>The Illness Narratives: Suffering, Healing, and the
                        Human Condition</em> (New York: Basic Books, 1988). It
                    is important to bear in mind Charles Rosenberg’s on the
                    meaning of “disease”: “It is not simply a less than optimum
                    physiological state. The reality is obviously a good deal
                    more complex; disease is at once a biological event, a
                    generation-specific repertoire of verbal constructs
                    reflecting medicine’s intellectual and institutional
                    history, an occasion of and potential legitimation for
                    public policy, an aspect of social role and
                    individual—intrapsychic—identity, a sanction for cultural
                    values, and a structuring element in doctor and patient
                    interaction. In some ways disease does not exist until we
                    have agreed that it does, by perceiving, naming, and
                    responding to it.” See Charles E. Rosenberg, “Introduction:

                <p>With the rise of medical humanism, a Galenic revival took
                    place in the sixteenth century. It was brought about, on the
                    one hand, by Andreas Vesalius (1514–1564) and, on the other,
                    more fundamentally, by the increasing availability of Latin
                    translations of Greek medical classics created by the
                    development of the printing press. One of the consequences
                    of the “Medical Renaissance” was the increasing concern and
                    effort among university-educated physicians to control the
                    once ubiquitous practice of bloodletting in order to
                    maintain their status and authority. See Sachiko Kusukawa,

                    defined taxonomy, as the materials in the manuscript present
                    multiple possibilities of interpretation. For example, plant

                    can be categorized into both the foodstuffs and plant

                    linseed oil, clove oil, olive oil, wheat oil, guaiac oil,
                    turpentine and turpentine oil are materials extracted from

                    based on their uses in metalworking and colormaking.<a

                <p>Enemas are one of the therapeutic methods common to most
                    parts of the world. In early modern Europe, enemas, also
                    known as clyster, required the use of the clyster syringe, a
                    syringe with a rectal nozzle and a plunger. The seventeenth
                    century has been called the “century of the enema” or “age
                    of clysters.” The French king Louis XIV was a fanatic for
                    this cure, in some periods of his reign receiving an enema
                    every day. This remedy had already been popularized in the
                    sixteenth century. It was believed that receiving a regular
                    enema was good for well-being, since it purged the corrupted
                    matters from the body. The main development of the technique
                    in this period was to replace the plunger with a bulb, which
                    self-application easier. This had successfully resolved the
                    embarrassment of receiving an enema from a practitioner,
                    making it a “fashionable” cure among the French public. The
                    apparatus described in Ms. Fr. 640, however, still belongs
                    to the previous type, but it too had the intention of making
                    it easier to give an enema to oneself. See Laurinda S.
                    Dixon, “Some Penetrating Insights: The Imagery of Enemas in
                    Art,” <em>Art Journal</em> 52, no. 3 (1993): 28–35.<a

                <p>The recipe on fol. 71r for mulled and sugared wine uses wine
                    as main ingredient, while five other recipes use it in other
                    ways: On fol. 20v foaming wine is said to contribute to the
                    efficacy of the recipe, discussed below. Two others,
                    “Against windy colic” on fol. 7v and “Infusion of anthos or
                    rosemary” on fol. 102v, use wine as a solvent to extract the
                    effective ingredient from other materials. The other two
                    recipes are specifically for the stomach, stipulating that
                    food-based medicine should be taken with a small amount of
                    wine, thus indicating wine may enhance efficacy. See fol.
                    20v “A form of regime,” and fol. 37r “Medicine for the
                    stomach which heats it and unstops the liver.”<a

                <p>Vinegar serves as a solvent, similar to the use of wine. A
                    recipe on fol. 101v claims “All medicinal gums dissolve in
                    vinegar.” Vinegar was also used as a common panacea in the
                    sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. A recipe on fol. 170v
                    uses vinegar as one of the main ingredients for a medicine
                    to preserve oneself in noxious air.<a href="#fnref18"

                <p>Water, of course, was the most common solvent for preparing a

                    ingredients, and in others to swallow with the ingredients.
                    Two recipes call for specific kinds of water: holy water and
                    fountain water. The holy water in the burn relief recipe on
                    fol. 103r was applied as a purifying agent, both materially
                    and spiritually, to make an “excellent” salve. Fountain

                <p>Sulfur was an important material in (al)chemical operations,
                    and oil of sulfur (also known as “spirit of sulfur”) was
                    regarded as a strong and pure substance that could resist
                    putrefaction. There was also another substance, oil of
                    vitriol, which was produced from vitriol by the same
                    process. Though it has similar properties to the oil sulfur,
                    artisans tended to believe the oil of sulfur was superior.
                    It was not until the seventeenth century that artisans first
                    understood the two substances are actually one. For the
                    process of making oil of sulfur, see John French, <em>The

                    Manchester University Press, 2004), 32. This is noteworthy
                    as the old man’s secret overlaps with another recipe in the
                    manuscript. Beside the diet and emetics, he also kept a
                    “ritual” of medicine-taking every year. He said,“every year,
                    in May, I take three sprigs of rue, three of sage, three of
                    wormwood, and three of rosemary and infuse them in a glass
                    of good wine until the following morning. I drink the
                    infusion before eating, and I do this for fifteen or twenty
                    mornings, every year.” This remedy is similar to a recipe on
                    Ms. Fr. 640, fol. <a
                       href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/102v/f/102v/tl"><u>102v</u></a>,
                    “Infusion of anthos or rosemary,” for preparing an infusion
                    of rosemary to be taken with water “in two or three
                    spoonfuls of white wine,” noting that “this is for the
                    elderly.” Although the two recipes differ, the basic
                    principle of both is to take infusions of rosemary (and some
                    other herbs) with wine in the morning. As the merit of
                    rosemary was mainly to clear the mind and improve memory, it
                    had the potential to be a useful drink for older people. The
                    coexistence of such similar recipes illustrates the wide
                    diffusion of medical knowledge in early modern Europe.<a

                <p>Keith Thomas provides several cases for windy colic among
                    seventeenth-century English patients in “Bodily Control and
                    Social Unease,” 9–30. Although an 1840 medical text by an
                    Irish doctor gives a description of a windy colic with more
                    violent symptoms and consequences, the basic form is the
                    same: it is the occurrence of flatus in the intestines which
                    sometimes gives rise to terrible suffering. The disease is
                    caused by indigestible matter. The pain in the stomach
                    worsens in a short time, causing patients to suffer
                    “indescribable anguish,” “great anxiety,” “extreme
                    prostration of strength,” “extremities cold,” and “a cold
                    sweat breaks out all over the body.” The doctor recommends
                    applying anodyne stupes on the abdomen and giving an
                    injection with a tincture of asafetida, turpentine, and
                    opium. See William Stokes, <em>Lectures of the Theory and

                    Jones is higher than that of Lindemann. The former provides
                    detailed statistics on the number of physicians per 10,000
                    inhabitants, in 1500–1700, with the highest ratio of 16.9 in
                    Montpellier and the lowest of 1.4 in Lyon. Toulouse was one
                    of the towns where medical doctorates were granted. The
                    number of medical degrees steadily grew from 6.9 to 9.8 per
                    year in the first half of the seventeenth-century.
