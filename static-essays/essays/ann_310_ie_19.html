<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>How-to texts and technical treatises such as Ms. Fr. 640 elude
traditional methods of editing and historical analysis. Ms. Fr. 640
contains entries on a wide range of making practices from the sixteenth
century, requiring the expertise from numerous domains to decipher the
text. Understanding the material may involve historians of science and
art, curators, and practitioners familiar with the manuscript’s
described processes. The Making and Knowing Project thus employed
historical textual research, object-based study, and hands-on
experiments to reconstruct the processes and materials of Ms. Fr. 640 to
better understand the content. These methodologies are perhaps most
obvious in the research essays that detail historical reconstruction of
the manuscript’s entries, but they are present throughout all aspects of
the Edition, including the editorial and digital development. The
transcription and translation of the manuscript requires deeper
understanding of the artisanal/technical processes in order to produce
an accurate and informed digital text, as discussed in Soersha Dyon and
Heather Wacha, “Turning Turtle: The Process of Translating BnF Ms. Fr.
640.” Similarly, as detailed in Celine Camps and Margot Lyautey,
“Ma&lt;r&gt;king and Knowing: Encoding BnF Ms. Fr. 640,” the process of
encoding the text was not a straightforward application of a predefined
set of XML tags.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> The Project’s encoding emerged in
light of additional insights gained about the manuscript’s contents as
the interpretation of the text continuously evolved. The texts’ markup
became clearer, more precise, and consistent and, like the translation,
required editors who were able to integrate historical, technical, and
practical information. This methodology is described in further detail
by Pamela Smith in “Making the Edition of Ms. Fr. 640.”</p>
<p>The methodologies, decisions, and data management strategies employed
by the Making and Knowing Project emerged and were refined continuously
throughout the development of the Edition. The nature of Ms. Fr. 640’s
technical subject matter and of the Project’s non-traditional research
methods, as well as time constraints, defied working according to any
pre-ordained plans for the Edition. The collaborative editing and
integration of training throughout the research process resulted in
digital development that itself was iterative, interdisciplinary, and
collaborative. The transcription, translation, and encoding of the
manuscript text were completed in yearly summer training workshops for
graduate students. The research essays were composed by students in
semester-long graduate laboratory seminars. Expert guidance, peer
review, and contextual essays were provided by a wide range of scholars
in yearly Working Group Meetings. Early digital development took place
in text workshops and new course offerings in the digital humanities at
Columbia University (<i><u>Fig.
1</u></i>, <i><u>Fig.
2</u></i>, <i><u>Fig.
3</u></i>, and <i><u>Fig.
4</u></i>). The design and development of the Edition site was a
collaboration between Performant Software Solutions and the Making and
Knowing Project team. All components and aspects were under continuous
review, consideration, and revision by the core team of the Making and
Knowing Project.</p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/staging061825-0/images/ann_310_ie_19/145-FoHv_wYD6_LhloEuQhhrcFfwl-8XW.jpg" alt="fig. 1"><figcaption>Fig. 1. The 2015 Text Workshop working on transcription assignments

<h3 id="background-the-making-and-knowing-project">Background: The
Making and Knowing Project</h3>
<p>Through the creation of <em>Secrets of Craft and Nature</em>, the
Making and Knowing Project aimed to:</p>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Bring researchers together from different disciplinary backgrounds to
work collaboratively</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Train students and participants</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Create an iterative flow of research to continuously revise the
interpretation of Ms. Fr. 640</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>
<p>The Project involved students, scholars of the humanities and social
sciences (such as historians of science and art, anthropologists, and
museum curators), natural scientists (chemists, physicists, and
conservation scientists), practitioners (conservators, metalworkers,
taxidermists, and painters), and digital technology specialists
(computer scientists and digital librarians and developers). Teaching
and knowledge exchange took place in summer workshops, semester-long
seminars, annual working group meetings, conferences, hands-on sessions,
studio classes, and locations such as archives, laboratories, kitchens,
classrooms, and even foundries and marble quarries.</p>
<p>In each year of development, the Project’s schedule of activities to
iteratively study Ms. Fr. 640 was guided by an annual thematic topic
such as Metalworking and Moldmaking (2014–15).<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> The
cycle would begin with an intensive summer Text Workshop, a graduate
training workshop in paleography, translation, and encoding, during
which students gained skills in middle French script and textual study
by transcribing, translating, and encoding the manuscript. The draft
transcriptions and translations produced in the Workshop formed the
basis for textual, object-based, and hands-on laboratory research
carried out by students in the Laboratory Seminar, a graduate-level
course at Columbia offered each fall and spring semester. Each student
would compose an extended annotation on one or more passages in the
manuscript, resulting in the Edition’s <a href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/essays"><u>Research
Essays</u></a>. At the end of each academic year, the Project convened a
Working Group Meeting with invited experts and the Lab Seminar
participants to discuss and critique the students’ work. The Meetings
provided critical expert review and brought rich new insights from the
scholars’ varied disciplines. In the same way, the year’s laboratory
research informed the encoding schema and the transcription and
translation activities of the next summer’s Text Workshop. The
interpretation of the manuscript evolved continually, drawing from the
material reconstructions of the Lab Seminar and knowledge exchange of
the Working Group Meetings. Beginning in 2017, the Project offered new
semester-long Digital Seminars for preliminary prototyping and textual
analysis of Ms. Fr. 640. Through each cycle from Text Workshop through
Lab Seminar to Working Group Meeting to Digital Seminar and prototyping,
new insights were gained, generating questions and shaping research and
development in the next phase in the cycle.</p>
<h2 id="digital-development">Digital Development</h2>
<h3 id="introduction-1">Introduction</h3>
<p>Given the goals and methodologies of the Project, it was clear from
the onset in 2014 that a flexible and gradual approach was required for
the Edition’s digital development. The form of the Edition emerged from
the Project’s iterative research design. It would have been impractical
to make upfront decisions about particular technologies, software, or
the encoding schema and nearly impossible to conceive of all component
features. Instead, the Project began with two guiding principles that
informed all decisions and modes of work for digital development:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><blockquote>
<p>Generate and and preserve the Edition and key Project data in
sustainable forms through commitments to minimal computing and open
formats and technologies wherever possible; and</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Prioritize and facilitate the Project’s multifaceted collaborative
research process</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="digital-sustainability-and-minimal-computing">Digital
Sustainability and Minimal Computing</h4>
<p>The Edition’s development was firmly grounded in the principles of
minimal computing, which generally refers to work that is undertaken
with significant technical, financial, or social constraints such as
limitations in resources, funding, personnel, hardware, or software.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> For the Project and other colleagues
at Columbia University, minimal computing is closely tied to digital
sustainability: emphasizing durability of digital publications through
reduced complexity and the use of fundamental technologies and workflows
that have a greater likelihood of persisting. This commitment is founded
on the conviction that the Edition should serve as a resource to a wide
and diverse audience, enabling knowledge exchange now and into the
future.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> To publish a digital product like
the Edition, this means creating static web sites that minimize
server-side technology (see Static Site Generation below). This approach
reduces maintenance overhead, security risks, and exposure to
technological obsolescence. The Project committed to using a small,
common, and well-established technology stack: HTML/HTML5 with CSS and
JavaScript served statically from a webserver. This stack harnesses
fundamental technologies—ones that have existed and endured since the
early days of the web—so that products created with them are more likely
to persist into the future.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> The Project’s
technological considerations reduced the need for continued resource
expenditure on active maintenance, addressing issues such as security
vulnerabilities or version upgrades of components and their
dependencies. For example, without the use of (proprietary) databases or
Content Management Systems (such as WordPress or Drupal), creators are
better able to maintain control of their publications because they are
not reliant on third-party products or platforms. This foregrounded the
Project’s emphasis on the separation of prepared data from its
representation via interfaces, which are highly subject to technical
change and obsolescence.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> Data format and storage decisions
prioritized the ability for that data to be readily transformed to
multiple target formats so that content could be routinely exported and
converted to open standard formats, maximizing reuse and
persistence.</p>
<h4 id="facilitating-the-research-process">Facilitating the Research
Process</h4>
<p>The digital development of the Edition took place in tandem with
content development in a workflow which maintained a dialog between
technical and editorial activities. This was (and, to some degree, still
is) an unusual mode of work for a publication, particularly for digital
scholarship. A more usual practice found across academic institutions
and editorial projects is to separate the “scholarly” from the
“technical” work.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> Researchers produce scholarly
information and style it in written form, at which point they hand it
over to digital technicians who prepare it for publication. Experts work
within their own domains until they pass their part along to the next
set of experts. For the digital critical edition of Ms. Fr. 640,
following this traditional model might have meant the transcription was
completed by Lead Paleographer Marc Smith, whose transcribed text would
have subsequently been translated by Director Pamela Smith. She would
then have provided Digital Lead Terry Catapano with plaintext that he
would have encoded using a very basic TEI tagset, which would have then
been given to Designer-Developer Nick Laiacona for rendering online.
Critical commentary could have come from the transcription and
translation processes, and additional research (through reconstruction,
for example) would have been conducted from the static French or English
versions of the text. Each of these steps would have been completed with
little input or crossover between them.</p>
<p>As the Project has shown, this traditional approach would have
prevented the deep engagement and understanding required for the study
of Ms. Fr. 640 and similar technical, artisanal, or instructional how-to
texts.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> The manuscript codifies procedures
that are often difficult or impossible to understand without the
appropriate technical knowledge, hands-on experience, and historical
understanding to carefully decipher terminology and processes of
historical making practices. This applies to the study and presentation
of Ms. Fr. 640 from both the editorial and digital perspectives. The
interdisciplinarity of the Project’s historical and material research
extended into the digital development to take better advantage of
digital technology (and scholarship) for the study of historical
artifacts and texts.</p>
<p>How, then, to best facilitate such an integrated research process
while maintaining careful management of the evolving digital research
assets? Every yearly cycle (of Text Workshop to Lab Seminar to Working
Group Meeting) resulted in additional and revised transcribed,
translated, and encoded versions of Ms. Fr. 640, student essays,
associated images and videos, and commentary to be incorporated from new
insights. The Project’s strategy needed to support several
conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Digital development taking place in tandem with new and revised
content produced in multiple editing campaigns, requiring workflows that
could adapt accordingly</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Growing volume of data in various formats</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>An encoding schema that evolved over the course of years</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Data edited collaboratively by up to 50 people at once (sometimes
more)</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Access to data in development by Project team members as well as
collaborators from different disciplinary backgrounds, possessing
varying degrees of expertise, from inside and outside the Columbia
community, domestically and internationally</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="pull-left"></span>The treatment of Ms. Fr. 640 as a digital text was thus not just a
technical or digital matter, but a social one, involving coordination of
people and of scholarly inquiry.</p>
<p>The Project’s approach also had to be consistent with the commitment
to minimal computing. Many technologies that best enable exploratory and
collaborative work are not always congruent with best practices for
long-term sustainability of data. Additionally, some kinds of scholarly
content and experimental work developed in an educational setting cannot
adequately conform to minimal computing standards and thus require a
different approach.</p>
<p>The Project had no set plan for creating the digital critical edition
from start to finish, thus there were no precise workflows, sets of
tools, management systems, or concrete instructions laid down in
advance. Instead, the Project was adaptive and flexible, developing
strategies and methodologies that were responsive to participants’ needs
as they arose. The development of creative workflows and workarounds
occupied much effort and time on the part of the core team. Protocols
had to be reviewed frequently, with much revising, adjusting, and
sometimes outright reversal. Most critically, the entire team
collaborating at any one time needed to understand that all work was
part of a larger endeavor and thus that modes of work should serve the
Project’s overarching goals and needs. This often required compromise
and negotiation, especially in the face of policies developed to ensure
longer term consistency, which seemed tedious to the individuals who
participated perhaps for only a few weeks in the Project activities (see
examples below).</p>
<p>Collaboration and a flattened hierarchy were key elements in making
this halting and sometimes ad hoc process work. The manuscript at the
core of the Project was an intriguing and puzzling research object and
it attracted participants who were eager, motivated, and passionate to
unravel more of its knots. Moreover, Project staff, students,
participants, and collaborators were all equally unfamiliar with much of
the content of the manuscript. They thus felt comfortable raising
questions and suggesting new workflows. Students and team members were
hungry to learn new skills through the Project. The variety of
disciplinary backgrounds and skill levels led to an extremely generative
atmosphere of enthusiastic sharing and learning from one another.
Students and instructors had to be equally courageous in admitting
ignorance, being open to experimenting and learning together, and
potentially to failing, which led to new approaches.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="early-visions-of-the-edition">Early Visions of the Edition</h3>
<p>While the Project avoided making “final” commitments for the Edition,
its development was informed by a vision of the purposes it should serve
as well as a few key features. The first feature was a side-by-side dual
pane interface that would allow a user to view any combination of two
versions of the manuscript, choosing from the facsimile images, the
French transcription, the lightly normalized transcription, and the
English translation. Partly inspired by the fluid text edition of Herman
Melville’s Typee (<i><u>Fig.
5</u></i>),<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> the Project felt that this viewing
experience would enable a reader to better comprehend the experiential
knowledge contained in the writings of the author-practitioner. The
dual-pane view also maximizes the transparency of translation decisions,
presenting the graphical and textual sources for comparison.</p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/staging061825-0/images/ann_310_ie_19/1fScA7YCpYUG27QKX2-IEOV3f6zW4aTbF.jpg" alt="fig. 5"><figcaption>Fig. 5. “The viewing device” of “Herman Melville's ‘Typee’: a

Policy</u></a>).</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>Another key feature was the integration of critical commentary
alongside the rendering of the manuscript text, making editorial notes
and links to the multimedia research essays readily accessible. Taking
inspiration from the digital essay “Kafka’s Wound” by Will Self (<i><u>Fig.
6</u></i> and <i><u>Fig.
7</u></i>), the embedding of relevant resources into the manuscript
presentation would offer immediate illumination of technical processes,
materials, language, and translation decisions.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a>
Finally, it was felt crucial that the manuscript be searchable to
quickly find specific results and draw new connections across Ms. Fr.
640’s contents. Together, these features would open the manuscript’
content and allow others to engage with its rich record of making
practices and exploration of the natural world.</p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/staging061825-0/images/ann_310_ie_19/1FHm8-ayN8d6VePsTmBPxsRSd2au0v5Ur.png" alt="fig. 6"><figcaption>Fig. 6.

<p>To help envision the eventual elements of the Edition, the Project
created early wireframes, mockups, and prototypes. Some of these were
one-off projects developed in brainstorming sessions with digital
humanists and textual scholarship colleagues. In 2014, a fruitful
session with Columbia’s Group for Experimental Methods in Humanistic
Research (<a href="https://xpmethod.columbia.edu/about.html"><u>xpmethods</u></a>)
led by Dennis Tenen helped the Project team visualize ways in which the
text of the manuscript could be represented.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a>
These proof-of-concept mockups modeled ways in which the layout of the
transcribed text could mirror the layout of the manuscript page itself
(<i><u>Fig.
8</u></i>) as well as how field notes taken by students as part of their
research on the manuscript could be represented (<i><u>Fig.
9</u></i>). To test some of the desired features seen in Herman
Melville’s Typee and “Kafka’s Wound,” Research Associate Claire Sabel
created a few webpage wireframes with dual-pane views and a variety of
multimedia resources associated with manuscript pages (<i><u>Fig.
10</u></i> and <i><u>Fig.
11</u></i>). When Rosenkranz joined the Project in 2015, she and Sabel
further refined these mockups (<i><u>Fig.
12</u></i>). Notably, these early wireframes stacked the viewing panes
one atop the other rather than side by side. The side-by-side layout,
which would later become a hallmark of the Edition, was explored by
Project Digital Programming Assistant Bingyan Hu in a 2015 Wordpress
prototype that incorporated the Project’s preliminary transcription of
the manuscript as well as the facsimile images of Ms. Fr. 640 (<i><u>Fig.
13</u></i>). All of these prototypes helped to visualize and spur
discussion about the Edition and its components as well as to convey
these ideas to team members, collaborators, and potential funders.
Additional working prototypes, including two minimal editions
implementing the Ed Jekyll theme and the Prototype Edition created by
the Project’s Designer-Developer, would play a more integral role in the
editorial process, as described in further sections below.</p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/staging061825-0/images/ann_310_ie_19/1yAyh1XzW2eK03UWCs05nKbpODQ9qP_E1.png" alt="fig. 8"><figcaption>Fig. 8. 2014 mockup of a folio page of the manuscript created by

<h3 id="preliminary-digital-development">Preliminary Digital
Development</h3>
<p>Before the Making and Knowing Project’s work on Ms. Fr. 640, access
to the manuscript was limited to microfilm files or physical viewing of
the object at the Bibliothèque nationale de France (BnF) in Paris. In
2013–14, Project Director Pamela Smith worked from these black and white
facsimile copies with Research Associate Claire Sabel and a few
collaborators to create preliminary draft transcriptions.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a>
Smith launched the Making and Knowing Project in 2014, with the first
Text Workshop held in the summer. Then called the “Paleography
Workshop,” it took in applicants interested in gaining skills in the
study of historical writing and letterforms (paleography) by working on
the transcription, translation, and basic digital encoding of the Middle
French text of Ms. Fr. 640. The Project called upon the Columbia
Libraries’ Digital Scholarship Coordinator for the Humanities, Alex Gil.
Gil helped develop early strategies for representing the manuscript as
digital text, bringing in Terry Catapano (then Special Collections
Analyst, Libraries Digital Program Division) to consult on the textual
encoding.</p>
<p>To begin, the Project needed to transform the handwritten script on
paper of Ms. Fr. 640 from a physical historical object into a digital
one. Housed at the BnF, the manuscript is a bound book of 170 folios,
where one folio is the front (recto) and back (verso) of one half a
folded physical piece of paper, resulting in 340 pages of written
text.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> For example, the first folio
includes both 1r (recto) and 1v (verso). For each of the 340 pages of
Ms. Fr. 640, a separate Google Doc was created for the three separate
versions of its text: diplomatic French transcription,
lightly-normalized French, and English translation. The Google Drive
folder housing these Docs was organized by page through folders and
standardized naming conventions (<i><u>Fig.
14</u></i> and <i><u>Fig.
15</u></i>).<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> With three Docs per folder and 340
folders, the manuscript was represented by 1,020 text files. The
organization system allowed the Project to manage the digital surrogates
of the pages and easily introduce editors and participants to the
files.</p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/staging061825-0/images/ann_310_ie_19/1TNFdIPlKo_62GGw8Ubs0KIKnkXfR2tjo.png" alt="fig. 14"><figcaption>Fig. 14. Organization of the manuscript folios in folders in the

<h3 id="google-drive">Google Drive</h3>
<p>The editing of the manuscript text largely took place in pedagogical
settings: a series of summer training Text Workshops. The editing
workflow needed to facilitate two important activities: 1) collaborative
work on the same document at the same time, and 2) the transcription,
translation, and encoding of the manuscript to make productive progress
towards establishment of the text.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> Rather than gain
literacy in specific applications or tools that they may not use outside
of the Workshop, participants were encouraged to spend as much time as
possible engaged with Ms. Fr. 640 and build transferable skills in
paleography and textual editing.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> Accordingly, Google
Drive and its application suite (Google Docs, Google Sheets, Google
Slides) were chosen for their low entry-barrier to simultaneous,
internationally distributed digital collaboration. The advantage of
Google Drive’s free, cloud-based editing platform with sophisticated
commenting and collaboration features offered sufficient benefits to
offset the disadvantage of proprietary technology. Crucially, Google
Drive enabled collective editorial and scholarly work—a task
traditionally undertaken by only one person—as participants worked
simultaneously on the same text and saw edits in real time, also
permitting all collaborators to write and view comments on any part of
the shared documents. Participants left questions, citations, and notes
about their decisions, which fed the iterative process and informed
future avenues of research. Furthermore, prior to their work on the
Project, many participants had become comfortable using similar
applications, such as Microsoft Word, or were already familiar with
Google Drive. To this day, the Project has yet to find any other viable
alternatives to Google Drive that would so well meet the peculiar
demands of its research process.</p>
<p>Through additional customization, the Project was able to adapt the
Google Drive workspace to account for some of the friction resulting
from using an environment that was not “XML aware” to encode text.
Earlier Text Workshops (2014, 2015, 2016) focused more on paleography
and translation than on encoding. Training in TEI markup was ad-hoc and
minimized. Because the workshops involved 20 people for only 2–3 weeks a
year, dedicated training in an XML editor such as oXygen was
impractical, so simpler tools to assist in markup were needed. These
tools had to work within the context of Google Drive to fully exploit
its key feature at this time—the ability for participants to
collaboratively work on and see the current state of actively evolving
texts in real time. Therefore, the Project had to compensate for the
lack of the advantages of “XML aware” features such as validation, which
ensures that the markup is correct. Toward this end, Programming
Assistant Philip Cherian created Google Docs Add-ons<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a>
that provided lightweight validation of the markup. The tools addressed
some key markup features prone to error such as start tags and end tags
correctly matched to prevent overlap, and consistency in element names.
This solution minimally affected the core workflow of the transcription
and translation, but ensured that data would be clean for later stages
of development.</p>
<p>The Project’s commitment to Google Drive might seem to lie in
opposition to its commitment to minimal computing. Google Drive is a
proprietary, feature-rich application with frequent updates, limited
transparency and documentation, and focus on consumer usability and
interactive experience. Using Google Drive as an editing platform was an
unusual decision for an editing project that planned to encode the text
with XML markup. Google Docs are “rich” text (as opposed to plain text)
documents containing styling, formatting, and other information beyond
the text itself. In order to produce the core data of the Edition, the
encoded transcriptions and translations had to be exported from Google
Drive, stripped of any rich text features introduced by the platform,
and transformed into encoded plain text. Working in Google Drive
introduced a number of unique challenges that each required customized
solutions. Reliance on Google Drive thus caused the Project to
accumulate “technical debt,” preferring to employ a solution to save
time in the present and deferring the costs and time to implement a
longer term solution. Manipulation of the text within and out of Google
Drive was a significant area of work for the digital team, especially a
number of creative programming assistants and interns.</p>
<p>While the debt incurred was certainly not minimal from a technical
perspective, the Project did hew to the principles of minimal computing
in another sense: minimizing and easing the overall <em>human</em> work
of the editorial process. Textual editing, encoding, and manipulation—or
even simply working within an XML-aware environment—requires training
and a specialized knowledge base. The paleographic, lexical, and
historical work requires its own domain-specific expertise, which the
Project decided to prioritize over the technical skills, accepting
“significant constraints” in technical training in order to facilitate
the scholarly and editorial work of the Edition’s creation.</p>
<h3 id="tracking-and-maintaining-iterative-work">Tracking and
Maintaining Iterative Work</h3>
<p>At the onset of the editing process, an iterative workflow was
foreseen, but not to the full extent realized by the Project over the
course of almost six years. The idiosyncrasy of Ms. Fr. 640 and its
collective editing would require several passes to produce its
transcription, translation, and encoding, particularly if insights from
laboratory and archival research were to be integrated. At least three
Text Workshops were planned from 2014 through 2016, and each of those
years saw continuous progress. However, the necessity of additional time
for more advanced treatment of the manuscript became evident, so
Workshops were planned for 2017, then again in 2018, and intensive
sprints were peppered throughout 2018 and 2019. Milestones toward
completion were pushed forward, as “final” became second, third, and
fourth “drafts.” This was the result of methodology (rather than just
the text) evolving through each cycle. As described by Dyon and Wacha:
“Only through the act of transcribing and translating did the team of
directors and paleographers begin to understand how best to accomplish
the task at hand.”<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>Tracking work became integral to assessing collective progress and
the status of each version of the manuscript text. This required greater
control of “administrative metadata”—information about the creation and
management of digital objects (rather than about the data itself).<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> For the Project, this included
dates and times of when a file was last modified, the number and
identity of the people who did so, and what application or program they
used to make changes.</p>
<p>In 2014 and 2015, the Project relied on information contained in file
and folder names for tracking purposes. Workshop participants added
their initials to the folder name as they completed transcription,
translation, and markup work (<i><u>Fig.
14</u></i>, <i><u>Fig.
15</u></i>, <i><u>Fig.
16</u></i>). This alerted the Lead Paleographer and Project Director
that it was ready for their review, after which they would add plus
signs (+) to let the participants know the files had been reviewed. As
the encoding of the manuscript advanced and the Project’s data
management strategies matured, it became increasingly clear that
overloading the file names with administrative metadata had significant
limitations. The Project needed to be able to assess and analyze that
information more often and more accurately than what was possible when
it was locked in file names.</p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/staging061825-0/images/ann_310_ie_19/1TNFdIPlKo_62GGw8Ubs0KIKnkXfR2tjo.png" alt="fig. 14"><figcaption>Fig. 14. Organization of the manuscript folios in folders in the

<p>A different strategy for keeping track of each folio’s status was
implemented in preparation for the 2016 summer Workshop. In the spring
of 2016, the Project was fortunate to be joined by two exceptional
interns, Philip Cherian and Margot Lyautey, from École Polytechnique
through a partnership with Columbia’s Alliance Program. With their
assistance, progress tracking was moved to a spreadsheet, “BnF Ms. Fr.
640 Index Tracking” (<i><u>Fig.
17</u></i>). Going folio by folio, Margot and Philip assessed each
version of the text (transcription, normalized, and translation) and
recorded its status for both editing and encoding. It allowed the
Project to determine the remaining transcription and translation work to
be completed as well as whether any encoding had been applied to the
folio and which version of the schema (the 2014 version or the updated
one from 2015). The enhanced data informed a work plan for the 2016
workshop and a way for the participants to see their assignments and log
their progress. The participants were broken up into groups and assigned
sections of the manuscript (i.e., a range of folios) to be worked on
sequentially. By the end of 2016, the transcription of the manuscript
was largely complete, so the majority of the work to be done in the
following year’s workshop was translation and encoding across all
versions of the manuscript.</p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/staging061825-0/images/ann_310_ie_19/1dvrJnTKtfQqQf_ZKvNZiJ-10gfPPTdsk.jpg" alt="fig. 17"><figcaption>Fig. 17. The Tracking Spreadsheet for the 2016 Text Workshop.

<p>Beginning in 2017, the “BnF Ms. Fr. 640 Index Tracking” spreadsheet
was transformed by Assistant Director Naomi Rosenkranz into a
multipurpose management hub for progress tracking, record keeping,
planning, version control, and metadata (<i><u>Fig.
18</u></i>). The Index Tracking spreadsheet now listed the manuscript by
<em>entry</em> rather than by folio, a major conceptual shift.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a> Up to this point, the Project
organized the manuscript by folio and this dominated the way that work
on the transcription (and, by extension, the translation and encoding)
was managed. The organization of the manuscript files in the Project
Google Drive inadvertently prioritized one conception of the manuscript,
emphasizing the <em>folio</em> as a significant unit of text. Reference
to folio arrangement is standard for bound manuscripts and mirrors the
manuscript’s physical construction. This may not seem particularly
significant. After all, this breakdown follows the conventions we
associate with books. Text on the same page usually discusses the same
topic and thus generally goes together, perhaps organized into
paragraphs or separated by titles and headers. Books are cited by page
number, as opposed to paragraph, sentence, line number, or some other
unit. However, as discussed previously and elsewhere, Ms. Fr. 640 is not
a traditional book. Its text is fragmented: a collection of recipes,
instructions, observations, and experimental records. One folio can
contain multiple entries, each treating distinct topics as far-ranging
as medical remedies, varnish applications, and cannonball calibers, and
the relation between these entries is not always clear. When categorized
by folio, the text on each folio is considered as a unit, inadvertently
obscuring the fact that it may contain topically unrelated textual
units. The folio organization, therefore, can impede many avenues of
investigation.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a> While the Project generally
discussed “entries” as the significant textual components—for example,
it was entries (or “recipes”) that were reconstructed and analyzed in
the Lab Seminar—all references to the manuscript were by folio.</p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/staging061825-0/images/ann_310_ie_19/1WgDl2vR224fJWwbz_rfr5GfgNiYgL4Us.jpg" alt="fig. 18"><figcaption>Fig. 18. The Tracking Spreadsheet for the 2018 Text Workshop.

words as “professions” (cells BG477 to BJ477). © Making and Knowing

<p>As the markup of the manuscript progressed and its XML markup schema
stabilized at the end of the 2016 Text Workshop, the Project benefited
from the shift to an entry-centric view of the manuscript from a
folio-centric view, resulting in methodological changes and productivity
improvement. In preparation for the 2017 Text Workshop, the Index
Tracking spreadsheet listed the manuscript not by folio but by entry,
recording each entry’s unique “div” (i.e., textual division) ID and
heading (in both the original transcription and translation for quick
reference). Each entry was assigned a general theme such as casting or
painting to enable workshop participants to work on topically related
entries (rather than sequentially by folio) as well as develop expertise
and a more consistent translation voice in entries treating similar
subject matter. The participants were also divided into separate groups
of translators and encoders.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a> The translators worked
ahead of the encoders, tracking and dating their work in the spreadsheet
so that the encoders could follow closely behind them. Columns in the
spreadsheet recorded which groups of translators and encoders had worked
on each entry and when they had last made revisions. The groups also
used the spreadsheet to enter notes, questions, or open issues for
further review.</p>
<p>The more granular and detailed tracking provided the Project
Director, Lead Paleographer, Assistant Director, and Digital Lead with a
rich, coherent dataset to assess the new workflow’s efficacy and the
Project’s overall progress. It was becoming ever clearer that the
translation and encoding process could proceed indefinitely as the
Project worked towards an improved, more scholarly and accurate product
in the digital text of Ms. Fr. 640. As the two weeks of the 2017
Workshop were underway, the Project needed to begin thinking
pragmatically about how much longer “completion” would take. Separate
tabs were created in the “BnF Ms. Fr. 640 Index Tracking” Google Sheet
to track completion totals (<i><u>Fig.
19</u></i>) and daily completion rates (<i><u>Fig.
20</u></i>). These let the team gain a sense of how many entries could
be updated and reviewed, and the effects of factors such as number of
participants, group size, and thematic category of the entries they were
editing. Towards the end of the 2017 Workshop, the team used this data
to approximate the length and capacity needed for future workshops. As a
result of these projections, the Project held a week-long
“mini-workshop” with a handful of experienced participants in March 2018
and then another full two-week workshop in the summer. In October 2018,
the final workshop was held, a “micro” version with just Senior
Translation Participants Heather Wacha and Soersha Dyon, encoders Celine
Camps and Melissa Reynolds, and the core Project team. This brought an
end to the larger “crowd-sourced” phase of transcription, translation,
and encoding of the manuscript.</p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/staging061825-0/images/ann_310_ie_19/1wtkjcvNg62bCGBvdxC4zbunFAcCIA86B.jpg" alt="fig. 19"><figcaption>Fig. 19. The Tracking Spreadsheet showing completion totals at the

<h3 id="move-to-github">Move to Github</h3>
<p>The Making and Knowing Project maintained the texts of Ms. Fr. 640 in
Google Drive from 2014 to 2019. In February 2019, the Project moved all
revision of the manuscript texts to a repository in the software
development platform Github, a version control system for code
management and issue tracking.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24" role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a> Throughout the years
of editing the manuscript text in Google Drive, the Project considered
utilizing Github to track and maintain the folio files and an XML-aware
environment (such as oXygen XML Editor) to edit the files. With so many
changes and so many editors making those changes, however, Google Drive
still seemed to serve as the best platform for the Project well into
2019. Making the change to Github was repeatedly postponed because it
never seemed like the right time for the ongoing editorial activity. For
the core editorial team, it was also difficult for them to envision how
making the move would actually enable an editorial workflow that, once
enacted, would greatly improve the process for producing an accurate and
consistent digital text of Ms. Fr. 640. The workflows developed for
Google Drive were easy to learn regardless of technical expertise and
had become familiar to the editorial team. Because moving away from
Google Drive would require training in unfamiliar tools and modes of
work, there was fear of losing time that was better spent on engaging
directly with the manuscript. On the other hand, it was hard to see how
to reduce the growing technical debt accumulated by the many
accommodations made in order to facilitate work in the Drive (which was
largely invisible to those working in the Drive).</p>
<p>By February 2019, the focus of the editorial work shifted towards
enhancing consistency, accuracy, and readability of the encoded texts:
the Project’s “consistency campaign.” Dyon and Wacha describe the
efforts of the later years of the Text Workshops to make translation
decisions consistent throughout the manuscript to remove competing
interpretations of similar words or subject matter. Similarly, Camps and
Lyautey detail the work undertaken to ensure consistent application of
the tagset not just throughout the translation but across the encoding
of all three versions of the text (diplomatic, normalized, and
translation).<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25" role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a> Until the move to Github, checking
for compliance with these decisions was extremely difficult and time
consuming: each manuscript page was housed in a separate Google Doc and
all checks had to be completed by a human reading through all textual
passages. Even a seemingly simple string-matching search (i.e., the kind
of pattern matching function familiar to most as “find in page”: Ctrl+F
or Command+F) could not be performed easily across the manuscript as a
whole in Google Drive. The decisions and workflows previously employed
to aid and enable the editing of the text were preventing other
important editing and development tasks. As the digital development of
the Edition intensified, continuously extracting the manuscript files
from Google Drive and converting them to XML documents for use and
rendering in a development/prototype website was also becoming
impractical.</p>
<p>The costs of using Google Drive had started to greatly outweigh the
benefits. At this stage in the editing of Ms. Fr. 640, it was clearly
time for computational intervention. The Google Docs of each folio were
exported and transformed to XML files one final time. The XML files were
housed in a directory, <a href="https://github.com/cu-mkp/m-k-manuscript-data/tree/master/ms-xml"><u>ms-mxl/</u></a>,
of the Project’s <a href="https://github.com/cu-mkp/m-k-manuscript-data"><u>m-k-manuscript-data
Github repository</u></a>, and became the active working files. The
Google Drive was frozen by removing write permissions to most Project
participants, and Github replaced Google Drive as the public and working
environment of the manuscript pages.</p>
<p>The Project team as a whole had limited experience with Git and
Github as well as with text editors such as <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/"><u>Sublime Text</u></a>, <a href="https://atom.io/"><u>Atom</u></a>, or the XML-aware <a href="https://www.oxygenxml.com/"><u>oXygen</u></a>.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26" role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a>
Under the guidance of the Digital Lead, the core editorial team
(Director, Assistant Director, and the current three postdocs) developed
a <a href="https://github.com/cu-mkp/m-k-manuscript-data/blob/master/docs/fa21-github-digital-workflow.md"><u>protocol
for editing</u></a> the text of Ms. Fr. 640 as true XML—at the same time
as training in using Github, the command line, and oXygen (the kind of
hands-on, learning-by-doing methodology typical of the Project). During
an intensive, dedicated sprint, the team eased into this new workflow of
editing and data management.</p>
<p>Github’s built-in project management and issue tracking features
served as the new hub of activity and documentation. For each
consistency task already identified by the previous editing campaigns
(over a hundred), a new issue was opened and added to the <a href="https://github.com/cu-mkp/m-k-manuscript-data/projects/3"><u>“Consistency
issues in ms text” Project</u></a> (<i><u>Fig.
21</u></i> and <i><u>Fig.
22</u></i> and <i><u>Fig.
23</u></i>). As new consistency tasks were identified, additional issues
were opened. The team organically developed a number of issue “labels”
to help classify and manage the tasks. “Translation” and “markup”
distinguished between the type of consistency issue: for example, <a href="https://github.com/cu-mkp/m-k-manuscript-data/issues/96"><u>issue
#96</u></a> (“translation”) called for <em>empreinte</em> to be
translated as “imprint,” while <a href="https://github.com/cu-mkp/m-k-manuscript-data/issues/105"><u>issue
#105</u></a> called for the instances of smoke to be tagged as
&lt;material&gt;. To help manage time and allocation of tasks example,
<a href="https://github.com/cu-mkp/m-k-manuscript-data/issues/165"><u>issue
#165</u></a> to confirm that all symbols, such as ʒ (dram), were not
tagged as &lt;mark&gt;. The “problematic” label helped identify issues
which were more complex because there were outstanding questions about
how something should be translated or marked up, or further research was
needed. For example, see <a href="https://github.com/cu-mkp/m-k-manuscript-data/issues/125"><u>issue
#125</u></a> and the discussion about how to encode (and, ultimately,
translate) languages other than French that appear in the manuscript;

<p>After the move to Github in February 2019, the team worked on almost
500 issues labeled as “consistency.” The issue tracker served as a
project management tool, but also as a place to collaborate, share
information, cross-check, document, and record methods of work.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27" role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a> A demonstration of this is
exemplified in <a href="https://github.com/cu-mkp/m-k-manuscript-data/issues/92"><u>issue
#92</u></a>, a task to make consistent the spelling of “eau-de-vie”
(distilled wine or spirits), which had been irregularly styled
throughout the translation (e.g., “eau de vie,” “eau de vye,”
“eau-de-vie”). The comments to this issue capture how the task was first
undertaken in oXygen with a simple search, then, as the team became more
familiar with the tools available, employing search patterns (“regular
expressions” or regex) to find all instances. The issue records our
early trials and errors as the team gained more skills in utilizing
digital tools: discovering that the search did not capture all desired
results; crafting an initial regular expression pattern that was also
eventually found to be not fully effective; and finally calling in a
more experienced user to help create another regex pattern (which then
served as a model for other consistency tasks).</p>
<p>Issue #92 was one of the earliest issues the team opened and
undertook as part of the consistency campaign. It shows the Project
developing standards for how to record what interventions were made and
what methods were employed. It was important to continue documenting the
Project’s process for our own editorial workflow as well as for larger
transparency of editorial interventions (and in the spirit of open
scholarship). Issue #92 exemplifies the Project’s pragmatic approach to
learning digital tools for editorial work. Training was practical and
gradual, driven by the problems or needs as they arose and devising best
ways to tackle or solve them. As discussed elsewhere, this
learning-through-practice philosophy is characteristic of the Project’s
iterative, research-driven pedagogy (and pedagogy-driven research),
reflected throughout almost all aspects of the Project.</p>
<h4 id="github-as-the-digital-lab">Github as the “Digital Lab”</h4>
<p>In Spring 2017, the Project offered a new course modeled on its Lab
Seminar, the “Digital Seminar” <em>What Is a Book in the 21st Century?
Working with Historical Texts in a Digital Environment</em>. The goal of
the Digital Seminar was to provide students with the intellectual,
technical, and organizational skills to prepare text for digital
presentation and analysis through the collective creation of a <a href="https://cu-mkp.github.io/GR8975-edition/"><u>minimal digital
edition of the Project’s preliminary English translation of Ms. Fr.
640</u></a> (<i><u>Fig.

application of minimal computing: a textual edition of a manuscript (or
other forms of text) that utilizes a small technology stack, emphasizing
durability and reduced technical dependency over richness of interface
features. In partnership with the Project’s collaborators at the
Columbia University Libraries, including long-time consultant Alex Gil,
the seminar’s minimal digital edition used “<a href="https://elotroalex.github.io/ed/about/"><u>Ed</u></a>,”<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29" role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a> a theme for the Jekyll static site

<p>In the Digital Seminar, the Project’s Github repository emerged as a
“digital laboratory.” In the same way that the Project’s chemical
laboratory provided a place for hands-on experimentation with the
methods and materials of the past, the Project’s Github repository
created a platform for knowledge-sharing, collaboration, and pedagogy
(<i><u>Fig.
27</u></i> and <i><u>Fig.
28</u></i>). Since 2014, the Project’s chemical lab, a laboratory space
among the labs of Columbia’s Chemistry Department, served as a meeting
place for introductions to the unfamiliar: hands-on experimentation,
safety protocols, documentation of process through laboratory “field
notes,” and collective investigation and understanding. Github was not
unlike the chemical lab, a place for collaboration, communication, and
experimentation enabled by safety management: “a virtual space providing
tools for coordinated work and designed to contain damage related to
failure so as to foster experimentation.”<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32" role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a></p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/staging061825-0/images/ann_310_ie_19/1e2Inh7QAj97hlKBZAm0F1k_BK3QB84zg.jpg" alt="fig. 27"><figcaption>Fig. 27.

<p>To understand the affordances provided by Git and the issue tracker,
it is helpful to review the way files are managed, maintained, and
revised in Github. Github maintains a remote “main” set of files (a
“branch”) that serves as the definitive version of the repository (<i><u>Fig.
29</u></i>). Collaborators “pull” the repository to duplicate it on
their local machine. To make changes without affecting the work of
others, they can then check out a “branch,” creating a snapshot of the
repository with which to work. Revisions, additions, and other
contributions are made to the user’s branch and do not change the main
branch. When complete, the user “commits” their work, enabling the work
done in the local branch to be tracked and shared with other
collaborators. The next step towards integrating these changes into the
main branch is the opening of a “pull request” which enables review of
the work and additional testing to ensure that no errors or conflicts
are introduced. This is also the opportunity for a team to confirm that
internal standards and protocols are followed in the new work before it
is deployed. An approved pull request is then “merged” into the main
branch, and the main branch reflects the updates undertaken in the local
branch.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33" role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a></p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/staging061825-0/images/ann_310_ie_19/1iGrDjvU7-wImAXfCQU5GGCNe5GXaUFyi.png" alt="fig. 29"><figcaption>Fig. 29.

<p>The workflow and versioning capabilities provided by Git enabled the
Making and Knowing team—who were largely inexperienced and unfamiliar
with Github—to feel comfortable jumping into the new method of editing
the manuscript in XML. Using branches and pull requests provided a
degree of safety by minimizing damage to the main files. As described
above, the Project developed a workflow for the consistency campaign of
editing the manuscript texts, described in <a href="https://github.com/cu-mkp/m-k-manuscript-data/blob/master/docs/fa21-github-digital-workflow.md"><u>M&amp;K’s
Github &amp; Digital Workflows</u></a> documentation.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34" role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a>
Under the guidance of Catapano, the team created step-by-step tutorials
and guides specific to the Project’s utilization of Github and oXygen,
from the commands to open a new branch to regular expression searching
tips. As issues were opened, a team member created a new branch to work
on it in isolation. When ready, that member initiated a pull request for
review by Catapano or Rosenkranz who, as repository administrators,
merged or rejected the changes. With oXygen’s built-in well-formedness
checks and validation against the schema, the integrity of the XML files
was easily preserved.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35" role="doc-noteref"><sup>35</sup></a> Eventually, the Project also
employed the services of automated well-formedness checks, instilling
even more confidence in merging pull requests.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36" role="doc-noteref"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<p>The workflow and various checkpoints for editing the manuscript texts
acted much like the safety protocols prepared by Lab Seminar students in
order to undertake experimental work in the lab. Clear steps and areas
of potential risk were set out not just for the main user (or
experimenter) but for the larger community. In the chemical lab, the
safety protocols were always reviewed and overseen by Project team
members with requisite knowledge (often in communication with Columbia’s
Office of Environmental Health and Safety) to ensure the physical safety
of people, the space, and materials at hand. Similarly, the digital
protocol served to maximize the comfort and readiness of editors to work
(the people), the integrity of the Github repository (the space), and
the “safety” of the XML files (the materials). The lab safety protocols
always served as open reference materials for future generations of lab
students or team members who would undertake similar work. The editing
workflow documentation similarly served as a continuous reference for
subsequent editors. Far from inhibiting, these safety checks can be
powerfully liberating for those who might not otherwise feel comfortable
contributing or participating in collaborative digital work. One is more
likely to give something a try if there is assurance that one will not
actually “break” anything to the detriment of the group.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37" role="doc-noteref"><sup>37</sup></a>
The check points also provide feedback as one works (for example,
running a well-formedness check in oXygen will highlight common
mistakes, such as a missing closing tag) and proved to be effective
tools for learning and gaining confidence with a new skill.</p>
<p>The Github repository issue tracker offers another parallel to the
Project’s offline work: it is analogous to the Project’s <a href="https://fieldnotes.makingandknowing.org/"><u>laboratory Field
Notes</u></a>. Field notes are kept for all activity in the Project’s
chemical laboratory (largely the skill building activities and
historical reconstruction experiments of students in the Lab Seminar).
They are modeled on both scientific lab notes (analytical, documentary,
and reproducible) and anthropological field notes (reflective,
narrative, and descriptive). Field Notes are key for documenting the
preliminary research process, bringing together protocols, hands-on
work, textual references, and object study. They encourage the
experimenter to be as transparent and descriptive as possible about
their process. Critically, they enable others to provide feedback,
include their own work or recommendations, and take part in the
discussion.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38" role="doc-noteref"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
<p>The issue tracker is one of the fundamental features associated with
project management in Github.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39" role="doc-noteref"><sup>39</sup></a> Issues are online
discussion threads and can be used to report bugs, identify tasks, and
collect feature requests. Each issue can be added to a Project board
(such as the Project’s <a href="https://github.com/cu-mkp/m-k-manuscript-data/projects/3"><u>“Consistency
issues in ms text”</u></a>), assigned to specific team members, labeled
with topical tags, and linked to pull requests—all of which are
filterable and searchable. For the Project’s consistency campaign, the
issue tracker was fully integrated into the workflow—it is even the very
first step of the protocol, as discussed above. Some of the Project’s
issues are fairly straightforward, like <a href="https://github.com/cu-mkp/m-k-manuscript-data/issues/1524"><u>issue
#1524</u></a>: “change figure id in tc, tcn, tl (fig_p130r --&gt;
fig_p130r_1)” which identifies an error in the ID of a manuscript figure
and tasks the assigned Rosenkranz to correct it across all versions of
the manuscript. As recorded in the issue, the error is fixed and
Rosenkranz references her commit of this change as well as the pull
request that integrates the change before commenting that it has been
completed and closing the issue. Other issues are much more complex,
involving discussion, additional research, and sometimes even the
creation of related issues to parse the problem into more discrete
tasks. For example, <a href="https://github.com/cu-mkp/m-k-manuscript-data/issues/1112"><u>issue
#1112</u></a>: “Scope black / charcoal / coal / charbon, etc.” begins as
a task to gather information about how the Project had treated the
translation of words associated with “coal.” The comments between team
members show the methods undertaken to scope the problem, summaries of
the results of that research, ways in which the Project had or had not
been consistent, suggestions for what should be done, and discussions
about the “right” decisions to be made (referencing the Translation and
Encoding Protocols, secondary literature about “coal,” and questions of
grammar and sense). While the issue was complex, the issue tracker
structured, focused, and recorded the work and discussion to resolve it.
This kind of record of collaboration, practice, experience, and decision
making serves a very similar purpose to the Laboratory Field Notes.</p>
<h2 id="design-and-development-of-the-edition">Design and Development of
the Edition</h2>
<p>While the content for <em>Secrets of Craft and Nature</em> was being
prepared in Text Workshops, Lab Seminars, and Working Group Meetings,
the development of the Edition’s website got underway in 2017 with the
selection of Nick Laiacona as the Project’s Digital Designer-Developer.
Laiacona, President and Founder of Performant Software Solutions, came
to the Project with a strong background in developing and designing
applications for projects in the digital humanities.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40" role="doc-noteref"><sup>40</sup></a>
Laiacona worked with the core Making and Knowing Project team to create
the infrastructure, interface, and deployment method for the Edition
website.</p>
<p>To develop the site, the Project presented Laiacona and his team with
the challenge of constructing an engaging, multifaceted, and
resource-rich online scholarly publication that utilized a minimal
(i.e., common and well-established) technology stack comprising
HTML/HTML5 with CSS and JavaScript served statically from a webserver.
The commitment to such fundamental web technologies strives to reduce
obsolescence and the need for active maintenance, as discussed above.
Early brainstorming sessions quickly determined that the Edition would
be developed as a static site.</p>
<h3 id="static-site-generation">Static Site Generation</h3>
<p>Static sites are distinguished from dynamic sites which generate
webpages each time a user accesses them according to specific settings
or environment. For example, news sites change their content as time
passes, updating headlines or stories featured on their homepage every
day (and often every hour). Social media sites, as another example,
adjust the content presented to a user based on their login information,
customizing the user experience based on relevance (e.g., location,
interests, or the activity of other connected users). Most websites
familiar to anyone browsing the internet are dynamic sites, featuring
interactive components such as responsive animation, commenting
features, or customized searching.</p>
<p>The majority of dynamic sites are typically created using a content
management system (CMS) in which the site's content is kept in a
database and rendered into HTML when requested.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41" role="doc-noteref"><sup>41</sup></a>
This approach often requires the employment of proprietary software as
well as a large number of resources, broader institutional support, or
constant maintenance. The two key features of dynamic sites—database
storage and the underlying server-side scripting language (such as Ruby
or PHP)—are particularly difficult to maintain due to the advanced
technological expertise/training they require, the complex dependencies
they introduce, and their large digital footprint. There are a number of
popular platforms, such as Wordpress or Drupal, which offer
user-friendly templates and solutions for creating a dynamic website
regardless of technical proficiency.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42" role="doc-noteref"><sup>42</sup></a> These sites, however,
are not immune to obsolescence or costly maintenance, evident most
obviously in the challenges presented every time there is a software
update or even a change in navigation or sitemap. Linked pages are no
longer available or have moved, sometimes resulting in lost content if
those pages or features are not preserved and migrated. Many services
and any associated content are discontinued altogether, such as Yahoo
GeoCities, Google Play, and Apple Aperture (not to mention social
networking sites like Vine and Friendster).<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43" role="doc-noteref"><sup>43</sup></a></p>
<p>Static sites, unlike CMS or database-driven projects, deliver static
webpages where all content and styling is created in advance. Content is
served in its final form and sent as-is to a user—there is no dynamic
creation or presentation of content through server-side scripts querying
databases. To change or update what a user sees, the static file itself
is revised or regenerated with new content as opposed to relying on
software that dynamically and responsively changes the site based on new
content.</p>
<p>Brian Rinaldi defines a static site as one which meets the following
four requirements:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><blockquote>
<p>Static site files are delivered to the end user exactly as they are
on the server</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>There is no server-side language</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>There is no database</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Static sites are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44" role="doc-noteref"><sup>44</sup></a></p>
</blockquote></li>
</ol>
<p><span class="pull-left"></span>A very helpful illustrative analogy is offered by Eduardo Bouças,
who compares visiting a website to visiting a newsstand for a
newspaper.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45" role="doc-noteref"><sup>45</sup></a> A static site generator would have
compiled in advance all of the content into a newspaper provided to the
newsstand. A visitor can then take a newspaper immediately and it will
be the exact same newspaper obtained by the previous and subsequent
visitors that day. On the other hand, a dynamic site creates the
newspaper from scratch each and every time a visitor comes to the
newsstand. The newsstand would alert a slew of phone operators to
contact news agencies to get the content for the newspaper—representing
the way that a server-side script queries multiple databases for site
content. The information collected by the operators is then sent to a
publisher—playing the role of a templating engine—who formats and
presents the results as a newspaper (the HTML webpage). Dynamic sites
are thus much more laborious on the backend, collecting information and
presenting the content anew for each visitor. There are many moving
parts and dependencies, and increased potential for something to go
wrong, change, update, require attention, or simply break, creating a
chain reaction of maintenance for all parts in the system.</p>
<p>Generating a static site offers a number of advantages. Because
static sites use well-established, fundamental web technology, the
techniques for serving static sites are likely to persist into the
future as well as be universally understood by IT professionals tasked
with keeping the assets online. Critically, static site generation
allows websites to be created with significantly fewer dependencies, and
reduces maintenance overhead, as well as minimizes the risk of
technological obsolescence. Furthermore, open source web servers like
Apache and Nginx<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46" role="doc-noteref"><sup>46</sup></a> can very efficiently serve large
amounts of static data and respond to increased user traffic, leading to
lower server costs.</p>
<p>The biggest challenge in developing a website using this approach is
the need to adopt or build an appropriate static site generator for the
project. There are a number of existing static site generators<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47" role="doc-noteref"><sup>47</sup></a> including the most well known, Hugo
and Jekyll, as well as Github’s service, Github Pages, which allow a
user to easily turn a Github repository into a static website featuring
integration with Jekyll.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48" role="doc-noteref"><sup>48</sup></a> The Making and Knowing
Project had employed Jekyll and the Ed theme for two minimal digital
editions (the <a href="https://cu-mkp.github.io/GR8975-edition/"><u>GR8975
Edition</u></a> of the preliminary English translation and the follow-on
<a href="https://cu-mkp.github.io/2017-workshop-edition/"><u>Workshop
Edition</u></a> of all three versions of the manuscript, described
above). While Jekyll was initially considered for the <em>Secrets of
Craft and Nature</em> Edition, the specific requirements and desired
features of the Edition led to the decision to build a custom generator
instead of adopting an existing system.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49" role="doc-noteref"><sup>49</sup></a></p>
<p>Creating our own static site generator allowed the Project to
accommodate simultaneously the ongoing editorial and digital
development. Designer-Developer Laiacona created a static site generator
using Node.js. The Project’s infrastructure was developed and maintained
using Apache HTTP Server, React JavaScript Library, Github, AWS
CloudFront and S3, and DigitalOcean virtual servers.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50" role="doc-noteref"><sup>50</sup></a>
The Project has developed a generalized, community version of the
Edition infrastructure, <a href="https://editioncrafter.org/"><u>EditionCrafter</u></a>, that is
openly accessible to any user interested in employing our static site
generator in their own settings or for their own editions.</p>
<h3 id="the-edition-prototype-as-editorial-tool">The Edition Prototype
as Editorial Tool</h3>
<p>The working prototype of the Edition became another tool in the
editing process, providing an additional layer of review and an
additional method to check consistency and accuracy. The Project had
conceived of the Edition as comprising 1) the textual core—the text of
Ms. Fr. 640, 2) the critical apparatus—the essays on the manuscript’s
content, and 3) additional resources, not yet defined, that would emerge
as part of the research process. The areas of focus for digital
development followed this progression. Designer-Developer Laiacona thus
began with development of the dual-pane display of the manuscript pages
(<i><u>Fig.
30</u></i>). For each page of the manuscript, the user would be
presented with two side-by-side viewing panes from which any combination
of two of the four versions of the manuscript (the diplomatic
transcription, the normalized transcription, the English translation, or
the facsimile images of the folios) could be chosen. Because the text
was at the core of the Edition, the functionality of these viewing panes
consumed much of the attention of both the “editorial team” (Director
Smith, Assistant Director Rosenkranz, and the postdoctoral scholars) and
the “digital team” (Developer Laiacona, Digital Lead Catapano, and
Rosenkranz). Furthermore, because the development of the content (i.e.,
the translation and encoding of the manuscript text) was still underway
during the digital development of the content’s rendering, an important
workflow emerged, affecting both the editorial and digital work: the
ability to see real-time changes of the content in place.</p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/staging061825-0/images/ann_310_ie_19/1drbVuXBIkD6dFJaQpailu9X0kladMW_j.jpg" alt="fig. 30"><figcaption>Fig. 30.

<h4 id="rendering-of-the-folio-pages">Rendering of the Folio Pages</h4>
<p>In order to render the transcription and translation as close as
possible to the layout of the text in the original manuscript, it was
necessary to see how the transcribed XML looked in the diplomatic
rendering on the website. A “staging site” was set up using DigitalOcean
and AWS Cloudfront which enabled almost real-time updates from the XML
files in Github by automatically refreshing the folio views every few
minutes. This allowed the Project team to commit changes to the XML
files in Github and then see the effect of those changes “in situ” in
the rendering of the manuscript texts in the Edition site.</p>
<p>The reason for such emphasis on the diplomatic rendering of Ms. Fr.
640’s folios comes from the manuscript’s composition itself and the
Project’s commitment to echo this composition in the transcribed and
translated texts as part of the Edition’s reading experience. Ms. Fr.
640 is not a “clean” text: almost every page contains some combination
of authorial additions and deletions, marginalia, sketches, and
indications of continuation. Through the process of transcription,
translation, and encoding of the manuscript, the encoding schema had
grown to accommodate these elements and the Project’s deep understanding
of the relationship between them (such as how to relate marginal notes
with the entries to which they belonged).<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51" role="doc-noteref"><sup>51</sup></a>
The encoding of these elements as well as their visual presentation are
critical for direct engagement with the primary source
material—something that is often lost in printed as well as existing
digital editions. How-to texts especially benefit from consideration of
their composition—what can be learned or deduced about the
author-practitioner from the words he crossed out or added? Why does an
entry continue in the margin, fitted awkwardly around the text of the
entry below it? Were these added notes appended to entries after a trial
of the technique?</p>
<p>The rendering of the physical placement of each page’s elements began
with an assessment of the manuscript as whole. The manuscript consists
mostly of units of text under headings, which the Project has called
“entries.” Each page of the manuscript typically contains a few entries
(a notable exception is “Furbisher” which begins on fol. <a href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/94r/tl"><u>94r</u></a>
and ends five pages later on fol. <a href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/96r/f/96r/tl"><u>96r</u></a>).
The headings of these entries are written in an italic script larger
than the handwriting of the entry’s main body and are usually centered
on the page (<i><u>Fig.
31</u></i>). Some entries have what the Project has characterized as
marginalia, text that appears outside of the main body (approximately
90% appear in the left-hand margin) (<i><u>Fig.
32</u></i>). To translate these patterns of placement in the Edition,
Laiacona developed the Grid Layout rendering, designed to faithfully
render the layout of a single column of text, consisting of multiple
entries, surrounded by marginalia (<i><u>Fig.
33</u></i>). The encoding of the text dictates how the Grid Layout
should render it:</p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/staging061825-0/images/ann_310_ie_19/17sjiwVBeNugymV8b94Ikjs7oeMcF8LHS.jpg" alt="fig. 31"><figcaption>Fig. 31.

<p><span class="pull-left"></span>To produce renderings that were as close to the facsimile page as

for more complex pages such as fols. <a href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/3r/f/3r/tl"><u>3r</u></a>

<p>The representation of more granular textual features was another area
of focus. These textual features include both authorial (i.e., made by
the author-practitioner) and editorial (i.e., made by the Project)
interventions which the Project felt were important to indicate visually
to the reader. The rendering decisions aimed to make clear what type of
intervention was being represented (authorial or editorial), to minimize
overwhelming each page with too many different visual elements, and to
strive to deliver a familiar scholarly reading experience that also
meets W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53" role="doc-noteref"><sup>53</sup></a></p>
<p>After much discussion and review of different options in the Edition
prototype, the current rendering elements were finalized. Authorial
features are exemplified in this excerpt from fol. <a href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/3v/f/3v/tl"><u>3v</u></a>:</p>

delete it, the text is rendered in red and struck through. Where he
added words to the main body text, the text is rendered in blue, in a
smaller font, and superscript. The editorial features—commentary on the
manuscript text by the Project—needed to be represented in a manner that
made clear that these resources were a layer apart from the manuscript
text itself. In-line editorial comments which provide insight into the
translation, meaning, or composition of the manuscript’s contents are
accessed by clicking on red asterisks found on the folio page. Research
essays that discuss the reconstruction of an entry or its place in the
larger sixteenth century context are indicated by flask icons to the
right of an entry’s heading. All textual features are fully summarized

<h4 id="prototyping-for-consistency-and-agenda-setting">Prototyping for
Consistency and Agenda-Setting</h4>
<p>During the intensive consistency campaign, the editorial team worked
to uniformly apply the encoding schema across and within all versions of
the manuscript transcriptions and translation. These tasks were greatly
eased by the ability to see the text in the prototype’s dual-pane
display, enabling side-by-side comparison of versions. This setup was
what Project members had been trying to emulate for years, with multiple
computer windows, screens, and devices (<i><u>Fig.
36</u></i>). The team’s active editing also resulted in a feature
request that has since remained a feature available to all users: the
folio XML view (<i><u>Fig.
37</u></i>). For the Project, quickly pulling up the encoding of the
text greatly aided the consistency work and saved incredible amounts of
time previously spent toggling between applications and manuscript
pages. For users of the Edition, this feature provides further
transparency about the Project’s encoding as well as insight into the
manuscript’s text.</p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/staging061825-0/images/ann_310_ie_19/1TpKgUCpOcoLDasq2G9gAQwlJ4zS2VNrS.jpg" alt="fig. 36"><figcaption>Fig. 36. A 2016 work setup to translate the manuscript, including the

<p>The features and workflows discussed here focus on the Edition’s
display of the manuscript folios. A similar method was utilized for
rendering the Research Essays, working back and forth between digital
affordances and particular editorial desires for a familiar scholarly
essay (akin to a journal article) with multimedia elements.</p>
<h3 id="setting-intellectual-agendas-as-minimal-viable-products">Setting
Intellectual Agendas as Minimal Viable Products</h3>
<p>As digital development of the Edition site was underway by
Performant, the Making and Knowing Project was faced with making
decisions about the site’s interface and features as a whole. Since the
team was still generating and preparing content for the Edition, there
was a sense that the Project had a very clear vision for what the
Edition was. The translation and encoding protocols—now in states
reflecting over five years of development—were being applied to the
manuscript text. All essays produced during eight semesters of the Lab
Seminar were being intensively edited and styled according to a model
that had evolved over just as many years. This kind of “consistency”
work gave the team a sense of “finalizing” this content and, by
extension, the Edition itself.</p>
<p>While this was a critical part of the development of the Edition, it
did not, however, address larger questions about what the Edition should
do and how it should do it. The time had come for the team to again zoom
out from the details and re-contemplate the intellectual agenda of the
Edition as a scholarly and digital object. What information should the
Edition provide? What questions should it answer? How could it be used
for textual criticism, analysis, and interpretation of the manuscript?
What audiences should the Edition serve and what should users be able to
take away? The answers to these questions, which had been considered and
refined successively throughout the Project’s years of research, now
required translation into features and interfaces. Scholarly ambitions
also had to be weighed against the technical applications available and
the defined timeline. User experiences and desired features had to be
identified and prioritized in order to set milestones and clear
deliverables.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54" role="doc-noteref"><sup>54</sup></a></p>
<p>This process shows the “dark side” of collaborative and open-ended
work, where the affordances made possible by digital publication also
become potential pitfalls. Undertaking a project requires resources,
personnel, and time, but <em>completing</em> a project also requires a
definition of “complete.”<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55" role="doc-noteref"><sup>55</sup></a> The Project had
committed to funders and collaborators to publish the Edition by late
2019 which was pushed to February 2020 in order to avoid launching
during the holiday season as well as to coincide with New York City
Digital Humanities Week.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56" role="doc-noteref"><sup>56</sup></a> Within this timeline,
what needed to be completed? One way to answer this question was to move
away from traditional modes of scholarship in the humanities and towards
cultures of group work found in the technology industry: defining the
minimum viable product (MVP), an approach to project management from
agile software development and Lean Startup.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57" role="doc-noteref"><sup>57</sup></a>
While an MVP is typically defined as “the smallest amount of
functionality [a project] can deliver,” it is also useful as a tool for
the team to elicit feedback both internally and externally in order to
focus work and adjust the development plan accordingly.</p>
<p>Defining a “good enough” version of the Edition for its first release
(the MVP) was a difficult task for the Project. In order to move
forward, however, it was imperative that the features and functionality
of the MVP be identified so that the Project’s collective workforce
could be focused and strategically directed. While the team desperately
wanted to include as many Research Essays as possible and also continue
to refine the content and markup of the manuscript texts, there were
fundamental elements that still needed to be defined: navigation,
landing pages, the homepage, and search functionality.</p>
<p>The process of determining how and what to prioritize was “a
negotiation between thoroughness and expediency, idealism and
pragmatism, [with a] generated collective buy-in to a vision.”<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58" role="doc-noteref"><sup>58</sup></a> In the summer of 2019, the team
established MVP conditions for editing of the manuscript texts and the
Research Essays to help curb the scholarly instinct to continue working
on these tasks that could (and would) proceed indefinitely. For the
manuscript texts, the MVP versions would reflect the state of the XML
after any consistency campaign tasks (determined and tracked as Github
issues) that were completed by September, followed by two full
copyediting read-throughs of the versions and a thorough check of the
encoding across the versions to ensure they all contained comparable
number and type of tags. For the Research Essays, the team agreed to
prepare a select number of essays, choosing essays composed in the most
recent offerings of the Lab Seminar (Fall 2016 through Fall 2018) which
more closely aligned with the developed editorial style, as well as a
few essays composed by Project team members or invited scholars that
were crucial for the first release (such as Smith’s “<a href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/essays/ann_300_ie_19"><u>Introduction
to the Edition</u></a>”) or that were in a more completed state. Setting
these “restrictions” (as they were perceived by much of the editorial
team) was critical for allowing the team to work within the timeline and
with the available resources to prepare all elements for the first MVP
release.</p>
<p>The MVP plan also needed to include definitions for the navigation
and content of the Edition’s webpages. What information would a user
need and how would they access this information? Brainstorming sessions
resulted in a number of ideas and wireframes which the team used to come
to a consensus about what resources the Edition would provide and how
they should be organized and presented to the user (<i><u>Fig.
38</u></i> and <i><u>Fig.
39</u></i> and <i><u>Fig.
40</u></i>). Anticipating that the editorial team would continue to
revise the content of the site’s webpages and their organization, the
Project developed a flexible/agile approach that would enable collective
work on these resources. The Github repository <a href="https://github.com/cu-mkp/edition-webpages"><u>cu-mkp/edition-webpages</u></a>
was created to house and maintain the pages in Markdown so that they
could be edited by any Project team member, as could the JSON file that
dictated the site’s menu.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59" role="doc-noteref"><sup>59</sup></a> Whenever the Edition
site was regenerated, the Markdown files were converted to HTML and the
JSON file provided the layout for the main menu and defined the path
that each Markdown file should take.</p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/staging061825-0/images/ann_310_ie_19/1OgKKkhUwT3ZVWf-4ho_iGDZ-z4exssYX.jpg" alt="fig. 38"><figcaption>Fig. 38. Schematic by Tianna Uchacz of the Edition’s homepage,

<h4 id="collaborative-and-open-ended-work-the-dark-side">Collaborative
and Open Ended Work: The Dark Side</h4>
<p>Working together to produce a digital object is not something that
humanists often experience or are rewarded for. Typically, an article is
written, submitted, and published; a CV grows by one citation, and it is
done. The work is solitary and final. However, our world abounds with
products, particularly digital products and ventures which are, for
reasons of complexity or scale, the results necessarily of the work by
groups of people. These products, additionally, have open-ended
lifecycles, requiring ongoing updates, maintenance, and support. A
challenge for the development of the digital critical edition of Ms. Fr.
640 was to bring the participants out of the domain where solitary and
final work dominates, to one in which involves collaborative and
open-ended work (<i><u>Fig.
41</u></i>).<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60" role="doc-noteref"><sup>60</sup></a></p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/staging061825-0/images/ann_310_ie_19/1WGvthDCHae5mwOwGHI8hqPkslWSYWFJe.jpg" alt="fig. 41"><figcaption>Fig. 41. Graph representing cultures of work, solitary vs.

<p>The “cultures of work” characteristic of each of these domains are
not inherently superior or inferior to one another but have emerged in
response to the differing circumstances, demands, and rewards. Each,
however, has their own virtues and vices. While the collaborative and
open-ended culture of work was more appropriate and offered more
advantages conducive to the development of a digital critical edition,
it has its own pathologies that tend toward failure and must be
recognized and avoided.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61" role="doc-noteref"><sup>61</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="the-mvp-and-subsequent-releases">The MVP and Subsequent
Releases</h3>
<p>The first public release of the Edition was launched on February 6,
2020 using the tagged releases of the Project’s repositories: <a href="https://github.com/cu-mkp/m-k-manuscript-data/releases/tag/v1.0.4"><u>m-k-manuscript-data
v1.0.4</u></a>, <a href="https://github.com/cu-mkp/edition-webpages/releases/tag/v2.2.0"><u>edition-webpages
v2.2.0</u></a>, and <a href="https://github.com/cu-mkp/making-knowing-edition/releases/tag/v1.0.0"><u>making-knowing-edition
v1.0.0</u></a>. As of June 16, 2025, there have been twenty three
subsequent tagged releases of m-k-manuscript-data (and an additional 756
commits), twenty releases of edition-webpages (366 commits), and
thirteen releases of making-knowing-edition (236 commits). Each of these
releases is tied to a site build with new content and/or new features,
where the website was regenerated and packaged as a static site. From
the frontend (i.e., for a user accessing the site), there is no
interruption or even indication that a new build has occurred; users
need only refresh the page in their browser to see the new content. The
majority of these releases are tied to new content, specifically the
publication of additional research essays, which is where the bulk of
editorial work was required after the initial February 2020 release.</p>
<p>For the next four months, the editorial team created a two-week
release schedule as a way to structure work on the essays, using another
Github project to manage the tasks (<i><u>Fig.
42</u></i>). For every essay under editorial review, a separate Github
issue was opened with the essay’s unique identification number and short
title. They were then added to the project board with custom
editing-specific columns, where a number of Github features were
employed. The essays were grouped into bundles, indicated by a specific
issue label (“bundle 1,” “bundle 2,” etc.), to signal their review order
and release to the Edition. The primary editor was “assigned” to the
issue, making clear what was actively being worked on and who was
responsible. The editors moved the issue through the project board
columns as work was completed, such as content review and stylesheet
adjustments. When ready, the primary editor handed the essay off to a
formatter (another team member) to complete formatting, accessibility,
and media checks. These were also tracked with issue labels; the
associated task was completed when the label was added. For example,
“fol links” marked that references to Ms. Fr. 640 folios were linked
properly in the text; “figures” indicated that the essay’s media was not
only formatted correctly but also indexed in the Project’s master media
list. As the essay moved further along in the board columns, another
editor was added for secondary review and copy editing. After two
editors completed a pass through the essays, a release to the staging
site was built for all essays in the “Ready for staging” column. As with
the folio pages, each essay underwent multiple “render checks” by the
team in situ in the internal staging site, also tracked by board
columns. Finally, when the essay reached the “Done” column, it was
released to the Edition on the public-facing site. This cycle repeated
every two weeks, publishing each batch of new essays. Essays that
required further review were held back from publication until editorial
revisions were completed.</p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/staging061825-0/images/ann_310_ie_19/1DQRhhv5sv0rIBNHLV7zmWM0rfo_dzpeg.jpg" alt="fig. 42"><figcaption>Fig. 42. “<a href="https://github.com/cu-mkp/m-k-annotation-data/projects/1"><u>Annotations

<h3 id="feedback-and-site-redesign">Feedback and Site Redesign</h3>
<p>As discussed above, significant time and resources went towards the
rendering of the folio pages and the Research Essays. Consequently, with
less time available for the design and features of the homepage, section
landing pages, and other pages framing the edition content, the Project
accepted the limitations of a simple markdown-based HTML authoring in
order to take advantage of its efficiency. Editing this content as
markdown files in <a href="https://github.com/cu-mkp/edition-webpages"><u>cu-mkp/edition-webpages</u></a>
and subsequently converting the files to HTML for presentation in the
Edition allowed for some formatting and design elements, such as the use
of headings, emphasized text (bold, italics, underlined), and embedded
images and videos. Basic styling was agreed upon by the editorial team
(such as font, spacing, and sizing) and implemented through a CSS
stylesheet (<i><u>Fig.
43</u></i>).</p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/staging061825-0/images/ann_310_ie_19/1Y9r71oh88Uid6tJoW1n5rUIgbhfR584U.jpg" alt="fig. 43"><figcaption>Fig. 43. The homepage of the Edition before its redesign in August

<p>While this approach was effective, it left room for more “dynamic”
design features. In the fall of 2020, Designer-Developer Laiacona
brought in one of Performant’s in-house graphic designers, Christyan
Cadena, to take in feedback from the editorial team and present a few
design options for the landing pages. The homepage of the Edition was
redesigned to show facsimile images of Ms. Fr. 640 more prominently, to
encourage users to visit resources intended to help them get started,
and to feature pages that provide background about the manuscript, the
Edition, and the Project (<i><u>Fig.
44</u></i>). A new logo for the Edition was also workshopped (<i><u>Fig.
45</u></i>) and eventually chosen (<i><u>Fig.
46</u></i> and <i><u>Fig.
47</u></i>). The other landing pages were changed so that the content of
all subsections of a menu item (e.g., “The Manuscript” and “The Edition”
under the menu item “About”) are shown in one page as opposed to
requiring the user to click away or into the sections as a new page (<i><u>Fig.
48</u></i>). These design decisions were motivated by the desire to
create a website that is welcoming and inviting to visiting users. The
goal is to have clear points of entry for engagement with the material
and to present the (sometimes overwhelming amount of) information
contained in the Edition in a digestible way that clarifies instead of
confuses.</p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/staging061825-0/images/ann_310_ie_19/1p6cZ8EY5gJdZjuIHDY-Er_oOZkLqPA7s.png" alt="fig. 44"><figcaption>Fig. 44. The homepage of the Edition after it was redesigned in

<p>User testing of the Edition throughout its digital development was
conducted in a number of settings. Ongoing review by the editorial team,
especially during the period when the internal staging site was used as
part of the editorial process (as described above), identified bugs and
errors as well as generated new feature requests. Targeted user testing
took place in the Project’s Working Group Meetings where collaborators
could offer feedback about the Edition. In numerous presentations and
workshops, Project team members have showcased the Edition to new
audiences to encourage its use and elicit feedback for continued
improvement. Regular meetings of the digital team reviewed the feedback
and implemented changes. One of the most effective forms of evaluation
has been through the active use of the Edition by collaborators in their
research and by students in courses at Columbia and other
institutions.</p>
<h2 id="beyond-the-edition-the-sandbox-fieldnotes-the-research-and-teaching-companion-and-editioncrafter">Beyond
the Edition: the Sandbox, Fieldnotes, the Research and Teaching
Companion, and EditionCrafter</h2>
<p>One of the guiding principles for the digital development of the
Edition was to trade feature richness and functionality in favor of
greater longevity. Complex web applications are inherently more
vulnerable to both security and technical risks. Additionally, as more
features and functionality are introduced, the costs required to
maintain these elements increase. However, not all scholarly and
pedagogical work is adequately served by a minimal feature set and tech
stack. To address this dilemma, the Project adopted a “barbell” strategy
(often used in investment and risk management)<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62" role="doc-noteref"><sup>62</sup></a>
for managing and publishing our digital work. Our use of this strategy
posits an inverse relationship between functionality and persistence (<i><u>Fig.
49</u></i> and <i><u>Fig.
50</u></i>). On one end of the barbell are projects such as the Edition
where sustainability is prioritized over the feature set. On the other
end are projects where rich feature sets are gained at the price of
their sustainability. Ability to engage in projects on this end of the
barbell—where the cost to do so is high—is increased if the commitment
to maintaining them is minimized or completely eliminated: if something
breaks, it breaks. It is understood that projects on this end of the
barbell are potentially ephemeral and costs are saved because no work or
time is expected to be spent to fix it; maintenance is minimal, and
failure is tolerated. This strategy deliberately avoids projects with
moderate functionality and sustainability, as these tend to be less
successful overall.</p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/staging061825-0/images/ann_310_ie_19/1ItnRlZeyylTqUJNIvyOlzxPiJog7sNqg.jpg" alt="fig. 49"><figcaption>Fig. 49. Graph showing the inverse relationship between persistence

<p>For the Project, the Edition sits on the “sustainability” end of the
barbell (Fig. 50) and a separate publication, the <a href="https://cu-mkp.github.io/sandbox/"><u>Making and Knowing Project
Sandbox</u></a>, was developed to sit at the other end of
“functionality.” Publicly launched in January 2021, about a year after
the public launch of the Edition, the Sandbox is an environment and area
of activity for exploration and experimentation, allowing the Project to
investigate new avenues of analysis, rapidly prototype, and share
preliminary research or methods of work. Innovative and exploratory
research would be best served by reducing the commitment to preservation
of the results in favor of maximizing freedom to experiment with and
implement diverse tools, technologies, and methods. Many of the elements
now made public through the Sandbox had been made, used, and referenced
by the Project throughout the making of the Edition. These include
mockups and wireframes, visualizations and analysis of Ms. Fr. 640’s
text, and syllabi and lesson plans from the Project’s courses In
addition to the Sandbox, the Project published the <a href="https://teaching640.makingandknowing.org/"><u>Research and
Teaching Companion</u></a> to the <em>Secrets of Craft and Nature</em>
in 2024. It makes available resources created in the process of studying
Ms. Fr. 640 and creating the Edition for teachers, researchers, and
makers who wish to integrate hands-on and digital components into their
classes, research projects, and art practice.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>We are finishing this essay in March 2025, more than five years after
the initial launch of the Edition in 2020. As a form of conclusion, we
thought it might be useful to articulate some of our thoughts on the
overall development process since that initial launch.</p>
<p>Our process was necessarily iterative and collaborative—continuously
adapting to the circumstances as they changed, weighing tradeoffs in
moving the project forward, particularly before and after each intensive
work sprint. For example, not requiring specialized technical expertise
and choosing familiar and general applications such as Google Docs,
lowered the bar for participation and expanded opportunities for
collaboration. This was an intentional deferment of costs such as
technical debts due to workarounds and workflows. There were, of course,
also unintended outcomes. Despite our efforts to minimize future
maintenance demands, they could not be fully eliminated. There was also
still a temptation and a need to make changes and fixes to both the
content (twenty three releases since the initial launch!) and to
unanticipated technical issues. There was no textbook to be followed in
undertaking a project such as this, nor did a textbook emerge from it
(although this very lengthy essay is a contender for such a title!).
What did emerge was a recognition that opportunities and demands will
present themselves continually, requiring constant careful consideration
of their costs and benefits. It would have been naive, and futile, to
determine upfront a set of TEI elements to use, develop specs, find
developers, deploy a web application to display the edition, then expect
to hand it off to someone to host somewhere in perpetuity as a web
application, and move on. For the reasons discussed, this would never
have been possible! Ultimately, the Making and Knowing Project's
approach demonstrates the potential of digital tools and methods to
transform scholarly practice. By embracing collaboration, iteration, and
flexibility, the Project successfully created a digital edition that
reflects the multifaceted nature of Ms. Fr. 640 and facilitates ongoing
research and engagement with this unique historical text.</p>
<p>Note on citations and bibliography: We have included stable URLs
(such as DOIs or permalinks) for resources outside this Edition to ease
navigation and access to readers. As is discussed throughout this essay,
however, even the most stable digital objects are inherently ephemeral.
Thus, it is likely that some of the links provided to external sites
will begin to break after the publication of this essay in June
2025.</p>

<li id="fn24"><p>Github (<a href="https://github.com/"><u>https://github.com/</u></a>) is a hosting
platform for software development that utilizes Git, the open source
system for distributed version control and source code management (<a href="https://git-scm.com/"><u>https://git-scm.com/</u></a>). Github
allows large-scale and international collaboration on thousands of
projects. While Git was originally intended for software development, it
can be used in any collaborative working setup where maintenance of

Columbia University’s digital humanities community has created a number
of Jekyll templates, including Ed (for text-heavy projects) and <a href="https://minicomp.github.io/wax/"><u>Wax</u></a> (for images, <a href="https://minicomp.github.io/wax/"><u>https://minicomp.github.io/wax/</u></a>),

Digital Edition of a Historical or Literary Text</em> (2017),
<em>Introduction to Minimal Computing</em> (2018), and <em>Introduction
to Jekyll</em> (2019). As participants in these workshops, the authors
of this essay noted Jekyll’s complications. For example, Windows users
were prevented from fully participating because workflows had been
developed for OSX (Mac) or Linux users (an obstacle that has since been
reduced by the Windows Subsystem for Linux). Another barrier is the need
to download and install a Ruby development environment in order to run
Jekyll locally, an overwhelming task for novice (and even some expert)
users of the command line.<a href="#fnref49" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
