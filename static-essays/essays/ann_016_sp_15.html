    <p>The entry for “Excellent Sand” on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/83r/f/83r/tl"><u>83r</u></a>
        of BnF Ms. Fr. 640 is one among a variety of entries on sands and
        techniques for their use in frame molds. Most “sands” (<em>sable</em>)
        in the manuscript consist of a dry powder, which is combined with a
        liquid binder. This recipe follows such a pattern, calling for the
        powder of burned alabaster, ground and well-sieved, mixed with a certain
        ratio of sal ammoniac and left to humidify until it forms a paste.</p>
    <p>Two different types of stones are known as alabaster. One, calcite
        alabaster, is found primarily in the Middle and Near East. The other,
        which would likely have been used by the author-practitioner, is called
        gypsum alabaster and is found throughout continental Europe and the
        United Kingdom. Gypsum alabaster is a fine white stone understood today
        to be of the same chemical composition as gypsum, CaSO<sub>4</sub>·2H<sub>2</sub>O. When heated, both alabaster types release their water
        molecules and become calcium sulfate hemihydrate, which is plaster.<a

           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref1"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> The use of plaster (also denoted
        as a “sand” in Ms. Fr. 640) occurs throughout the manuscript, notably as
        a mold material used in lifecasting. While the plaster for lifecasting
        is a liquid “sand” poured around the organic object (plant, animal,
        flower, etc.) in a clay casing, the sand referred to on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/83r/f/83r/tl"><u>83r</u></a>
        is for frame molding, in which the object to be reproduced is pressed
        into damp sand contained in a wooden frame. The author-practitioner was
        clearly aware of the material connection between plaster and alabaster,
        as he notes in the margin of fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/125v/f/125v/tl"><u>125v</u></a>,
        next to an entry for plaster molds into which wax is cast, that
        “alabaster, commonly called so, which is nevertheless plaster, is very
        hard but it shrinks a lot. It is very good to make medals, but it wants
        to be very finely sieved.” Because the author-practitioner equated
        plaster and alabaster, we aimed in our reconstruction to determine
        whether a qualitative difference existed between sand made with
        pulverized alabaster and that made with plaster that would cause the
        author-practitioner to mention alabaster by name as a specifically
        “excellent” material for making sand for frame molds. And if there was
        no clear difference between the products cast in alabaster and in
        plaster, what might account for his inclusion of each as a distinct mold
        material? We investigate here not only the physical properties of
        alabaster sand but also its symbolic connotations, as they reveal much
        about alabaster’s status as an elite material in late medieval and early
        modern Europe, which might have encouraged the author-practitioner to
        highlight its excellence.</p>
    <p>The search for an “excellent” molding sand preoccupied not only the
        author-practitioner of Ms. Fr. 640, but many early modern craftsmen
        whose technical writings have come down to us.<a href="#fn2"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref2"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> The entry for alabaster sand on
        fol. 83r is comparable to those found in several other sand recipes in
        Ms. Fr. 640, most notably one for sand using calcined ox bone and rock
        salt on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/89r/f/89r/tl"><u>89r</u></a>.
        Both use a calcined raw material that is then finely ground, mixed with
        salt, and humidified to form a paste for molding. Yijun Wang and Pamela
        Smith’s essay on the entry on fol. 89r details how dry salt acts as a
        binder in this class of recipes, in contrast to the various forms of
        liquid binders mentioned in other recipes.<a href="#fn3"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref3"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> It is clear that for the early
        modern craftsman, mold materials were of equal intellectual and
        experimental interest as the metals themselves. Of course, these molds
        rarely survived past the production process; thus text-based
        reconstructions are one of the only ways to shed light on the properties
        of these various mold materials.</p>
    <p>The author-practitioner was not the only one to describe burned alabaster
        as a mold material. Hugh Plat, in <em>The Jewel House of Art and
            Nature</em> (London, 1594), notes in a section on “The Art of
        Molding and Casting” how to prepare molds for casting branches or
        flowers from life from a mixture of “burnt alabaster and plaister of
        Paris” in equal portions.<a href="#fn4"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref4"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> As in Ms. Fr. 640, Plat
        recommends mixing three parts of this alabaster and plaster mixture to
        one part ground brick or terra cotta tile, a small amount of “spawd,”<a
           href="#fn5"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref5"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> and water with sal ammoniac. He
        also mentions that if one wants to cast in wax, the mold can be made
        from plaster or alabaster alone, or a mixture of the two. Plat’s
        instructions are for a liquid molding “sand” for lifecasting, rather
        than a damp “sand” for a frame mold. It is interesting to note, however,
        that Ms. Fr. 640’s author-practitioner is not alone in seeing a
        distinction between the chemically identical materials of burnt
        alabaster and plaster of Paris. Indeed, contemporary pigment companies
        such as the German Kremer Pigments sell “<em>Alabaster Modellgips</em>”
        (modeling plaster), which they claim is “of prime crystallinity, and
        hardens especially hard and translucent.”<a href="#fn6"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref6"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> This provided further impetus for
        our comparative experiment.</p>
    <h2 id="reconstruction">Reconstruction</h2>
    <p>We began our experiments with 2 kg of raw gypsum alabaster stones.<a
           href="#fn7"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref7"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> After laboriously breaking the
        raw stones into smaller chunks to facilitate even calcination, we
        calcined them in both a toaster oven in the lab and our home ovens. With
        a bit of research, we determined that alabaster calcines at
        approximately 170℃.<a href="#fn8"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref8"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> Fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/83r/f/83r/tl"><u>83r</u></a>
        instructs to calcine the stone until, “touching it, it turns into
        powder.” Initially we assumed this meant that the stones would
        disintegrate with pressure when they were fully heated, but we
        eventually realized that it more probably referred to a visually powdery
        surface that would form on the stone fragments, which then would still
        need grinding in a mortar once cooled. By an hour and a half in the
        oven, the stone fragments had turned a pure white, and the small pieces
        could be crushed with relatively little force (<i><u>Vid. 1</u></i>). We
        took this to indicate the completion of the calcination process. The
        next step was to “pulverize it finely &amp; pass it through a double
        sieve &amp; render it as if impalpable.” We ground the stones with
        marble mortars and pestles, and sieved them through tightly-woven
        cheesecloth lining a plastic sieve. Despite calcination, this was a
        labor-intensive process that required many rounds of sieving to achieve
        the desired impalpable consistency. Even at the end of our efforts, the
        powder was not quite impalpable: small granules could be detected when
        the powder was rubbed between our fingertips.<a href="#fn9"

    <p>The next step was the addition of sal ammoniac (i.e., modern ammonium
        chloride, which today comes in the form of small granular crystals
        similar to table salt). On fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/83r/f/83r/tl"><u>83r</u></a>,
        the quantity is noted “with one lb of alabaster, one needs one ℥ of sal
        ammoniac.” Interestingly, in a recipe a few pages later, on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/89v/f/89v/tl"><u>89v</u></a>,
        also dealing with sal ammoniac and calcined alabaster as materials for
        sand, the instructions are somewhat different: “Sal ammoniac, well
        pulverized <em>
            <del>mou</del>
        </em> &amp; ground dry on marble, molds very neatly &amp; is of a very
        beautiful release, &amp; once mixed with alabaster, pulverized
        similarly, ii ℥ per lb of alabaster makes it release well.” Here, the
        author-practitioner recommends two ounces of sal ammoniac for a pound of
        alabaster. We divided our calcined alabaster and made one mold using one
        ounce of sal ammoniac, and the other with two. We mixed the sal ammoniac
        with the alabaster powder.</p>
    <p>The next step was to simulate the “cellar or a damp place” in which the
        powder was meant to rest until it formed a “paste.” As we did not have a
        humidifier on hand, our initial attempt involved soaking fabric in water
        and leaving these rags in a cabinet with our sand overnight (<i><u>Fig. 1</u></i>). This produced no discernible change in the powder
        mixture, and we resorted to mixing water in slowly by hand until a
        paste-like consistency was reached that, when squeezed, stuck together
        firmly without being too wet. We had to add the water very slowly and
        mix vigorously with our fingers, because if we poured in the water too
        quickly, the mixture formed large hard clumps that had to be reground.<a

    <p>The recipe indicates that the molds must be hot to be cast into, so our
        next step was to heat them. We chose to do so in a toaster oven at 400℉
        (<i><u>Fig. 5</u></i>). Unfortunately, at this point our wooden
        frame molds caught fire and we had to start the project from scratch.<a

    <p>To humidify this batch, we acquired a humidifier and set up a system that
        would expose the powder to moisture in a more constant way. The
        different calcined powders were put on terracotta plates and elevated so
        that the humidifier could blow directly beneath them (<i><u>Fig. 7</u></i>). These powders were then covered with a domed plastic lid, and the
        whole apparatus was draped in linen to trap moisture (<i><u>Fig. 8</u></i>). The sand was left to humidify for seven hours. The resulting sand
        was quite satisfactory for packing, fairly hard to the touch but easy to
        break apart with light pressure, and it held its form readily when
        pressed, as described on fol. 118v, “Casting in frames” (<i><u>Fig. 9</u></i>). It was interesting to note that the gypsum powder
        remained fairly white, while the alabaster powder looked slightly more
        yellow in its paste form.</p>

    <p>The results did not surprise us: there was no discernible difference
        between the impressions of objects cast in alabaster versus those cast
        in gypsum (<i><u>Fig. 19</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 20</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 21</u></i>). As to the “excellence” of our sand, the finished
        objects did not come out as cleanly as we would have expected from our
        subjective understanding of what “excellent” sand for molding could
        accomplish. This is likely due to our inexperience with frame molding
        rather than any fault with the material.<a href="#fn16"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref16"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> While a certain amount of detail
        was picked up in each, the most subtle surface gradations were not
        captured. This was especially evident on the cast of a necklace pendant
        with a relief of a bird perched on a branch (Fig. 21). The original had
        quite fine outlines of individual feathers on the wings and tail, which
        were barely registered in the cast replica. However, the very fine feet
        of the bird, as well as the branch on which it was perched, were picked
        up clearly. The flat surface surrounding the bird showed evidence of
        granularity. The edges of each object were not cleanly cast, because the
        edges of the impressions had crumbled slightly when the models were
        removed from the molds. Despite these imperfections, it was clear that
        this was a sand that packed quite well and dried quite hard, but, again,
        being made of gypsum or alabaster made no difference. So, if alabaster
        is no different from plaster when calcined, in terms of the impression
        it picks up, why was it specifically indicated as an excellent sand for
        casting?</p>

    <h2 id="alabaster">Alabaster</h2>
    <p>Alabaster is best known as a fine material for carving sculpture. Prized
        for its pure white color, its surface is capable of being highly
        polished, and its softness facilitates carving. Both alabaster and
        gypsum are extracted from the same quarries, but alabaster is rarer.
        Most of the material quarried in alabaster quarries was in fact gypsum,
        which is too soft and crumbly to be carved and was sold as raw material
        for plaster.<a href="#fn17"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref17"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
    <p>Delicate alabaster sculptures were produced in several artistic centers
        in Europe during the Middle Ages and early modern era. Well-known
        workshops were located in Britain, in South Derbyshire and
        Staffordshire, and, beginning in the mid-fourteenth century, these
        regions produced thousands of relatively small-scale alabaster
        devotional images.<a href="#fn18"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref18"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> The objects produced in these
        prolific workshops were so popular and affordable that they were
        purchased and transported across Europe, at least until Henry VIII put a
        stop to production during his campaign against the Church and its
        devotional furnishings.</p>
    <p>More relevant for Ms. Fr. 640 are likely the Burgundian ducal workshops
        that produced breathtakingly detailed alabaster tombs for several
        generations of dukes in their administrative capital of Dijon. These
        tombs (<i><u>Fig. 22</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 23</u></i>) consist of fully
        painted white marble effigies reclining on black marble slabs, which are
        in turn supported by elaborate micro-architectural arcades of alabaster,
        populated with small alabaster mourning figures (<i><u>Fig. 24</u></i>).
        It is these mourners that have received most scholarly attention, due to
        their arresting detail and lifelike gestures. Unlike the marble
        effigies, these sculptures were only sparingly painted, highlighting the
        glowing white surface of the alabaster. The choice to leave the
        alabaster surface exposed indicates a certain reverence for the stone
        itself.<a href="#fn19"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref19"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a> Indeed, the contracts for each
        tomb explicitly specify alabaster as the material to be used for the
        tomb,<a href="#fn20"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref20"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> despite the documented delays in
        production due to the difficulty of securing sufficient quantities of

           id="fnref21"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a> The importance of alabaster
        specifically as a material for such elite commissions is evidence that
        it held a high position in the hierarchy of stone for sculpting in
        Burgundy. Alabaster sculptures also survive from the Toulouse region (<i><u>Fig. 25</u></i>), and they, too, seem to have been left unpainted,
        likely circulating among an elite audience.</p>

    <p>One can imagine a metalworker visiting the workshops of these sculptors
        to collect the dust left over from carving in order to use it for
        molding sand. Knowing of sculpted alabaster’s hard shining surface and
        crisp details (due to the ease of carving the stone), the
        author-practitioner might have hypothesized that it would form a hard,
        durable mold material especially suited to capturing the minute details
        and contours of the model to be reproduced. Indeed, in the recipe on
        fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/89v/f/89v/tl"><u>89v</u></a>,
        which also addresses alabaster sand, he specifies that upon drying, the
        mold will become “hard as stone,” which makes the cast easier to remove
        from the mold.</p>
    <p>The use of alabaster for tomb sculptures was not only tied to its fine
        appearance but also to its theological significance. Alabaster is
        referred to in the gospels, in Mark 14:3, Matthew 26:6–7, and Luke
        7:36–38. Though the setting of the story differs in each gospel, the
        basic story is the same: a pious woman comes to Christ bearing an
        alabaster jar full of precious ointment, which she uses to anoint him.
        Mark additionally specifies that the woman breaks the jar of alabaster
        to access the ointment. This moment received sustained exegetical
        attention from early Christian theologians such as St. Augustine<a
           href="#fn22"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref22"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a> and St. Jerome.<a href="#fn23"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref23"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a> Aleksandra Lipinska sums up the
        interpretation of this moment: “The woman bringing the jar signifies the
        Church; the alabastron [alabaster jar] filled with perfume oil
        symbolizes the body of Christ filled up with faith; and the breaking of
        the vessel stands for the death of Christ on the Cross.”<a href="#fn24"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref24"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a> This trope was extended to
        encompass the bodies of the faithful as well. Twelfth-century English
        abbot Aelred of Rievaulx writes to his followers to “break then the
        alabaster of your heart and whatever devotion you have, [...], pour it
        all out upon your Bridegroom’s head, while you adore the man in God and
        God in the man.”<a href="#fn25"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref25"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a> The association of alabaster
        with the body of Christ, and by extension the bodies of the faithful who
        modeled themselves in the image of Christ, led to the stone’s use in
        funerary sculpture as a symbol of the body’s potential for resurrection.
        This, coupled with the remarkable similarities in tone and texture
        between highly finished alabaster and human flesh, made the stone a
        potent, polyvalent material.</p>
    <p>Marble was another material celebrated for its ability to mimic flesh. In
        this vein, there is evidence in late medieval Europe that alabaster was
        sometimes called marble, and vice versa. For instance, the arcades of
        the tomb of Duke Philip the Bold were referred to in medieval sources as
        alabaster; however, recent analysis has shown they are actually white
        marble.<a href="#fn26"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref26"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a> Aleksandra Lipinska argues that
        this indicates that up until the eighteenth century “alabaster, like
        other polishable minerals and rocks, was counted among the family of
        marbles.”<a href="#fn27"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref27"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a> Marble, with its ancient
        imperial connotations, was a stone of great power and prestige, and
        alabaster took on those associations.<a href="#fn28"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref28"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a> Pliny the Elder was perhaps the
        first to associate marble and alabaster, referring in Book X of his
        <em>Natural History</em> to a stone called onyx marble that is sometimes
        called <em>alabastrites</em>. Though he is likely referring to calcite
        alabaster, since he mentions the stone is found in Egypt, he
        specifically states that this type of stone “is suitable too, when
        burnt, for plasters.”<a href="#fn29"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref29"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a> Thus we see as early as the
        first century CE the continuum between marble, alabaster, and plaster.
        Medieval lapidaries continued to group alabaster as a type of marble,
        for instance Isidore of Seville in his <em>Etymologies</em>. There,
        alabaster is included among a list of other marbles, described as “a
        white stone, tinted here and there with various colors.”<a href="#fn30"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref30"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a> However, Isidore too may be
        referring to calcite alabaster, as he states that the whitest stones are
        to be found in Egypt, Syria, and India. Whether medieval patrons and
        sculptors understood the difference between the two types of alabaster
        remains unclear. It is nevertheless evident that alabaster’s close
        connection to marble lasted through the Middle Ages.</p>
    <p>In fact, one recipe in Ms. Fr. 640 seems to make this connection as well.
        On fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/101r/f/101r/tl"><u>101r</u></a>–<a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/101v/f/101v/tl"><u>v</u></a>,
        a recipe for “Salt for melting” describes the process of making a
        modeling material out of common salt and saltpeter that, when ground and
        heated, will make a “substance white, hard &amp; even, like alabaster,
        with which you will be able to cast medals which will resemble marble”
        (fol. 101v). Here, where the resulting material is as white as alabaster
        and creates objects that resemble marble, the two terms seem almost
        interchangeable.</p>
    <p>It is notable that the author-practitioner also makes clear reference to
        alabaster’s relationship to plaster. Lipinska states that alabaster’s
        chemical relationship to gypsum was not widely known before the early
        eighteenth century,<a href="#fn31"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref31"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a> yet the working knowledge of the
        author-practitioner seems to indicate that the connection between
        alabaster and the “raw” plaster stone<a href="#fn32"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref32"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a> was indeed a part of artisanal
        knowledge by the end of the sixteenth century. This knowledge of the
        similarity between plaster and alabaster broadens our understanding of
        marble’s early modern taxonomy, connecting it both to alabaster and
        plaster. In fact, Theophrastus’ <em>De lapidibus</em> (third century
        BCE) makes the connection between gypsum and alabaster, when he refers
        to an earth called <em>gypsos</em> and a stone called
        <em>alabastrites</em> that can be found within this earth, both of which
        give off “stickiness and heat, when [...] wet,” after having been
        burned.<a href="#fn33"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref33"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a> He states that this substance is
        “used on buildings and is poured around the stone or anything else of
        this kind that one wishes to fasten.”<a href="#fn34"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref34"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a> He even mentions that painters
        in Italy use it for their art (ground alabaster and gypsum are still
        used in the preparation of gesso today).<a href="#fn35"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref35"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>35</sup></a> Theophrastus clearly refers to
        gypsum plaster here and distinguishes the hard stone form of it as
        <em>alabastrites</em>. Thus we can see that the author-practitioner’s
        experiential view of a continuum of marble, alabaster, and plaster
        stands in a long lineage of knowledge about stones.<a href="#fn36"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref36"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
    <p>If we consider that our author-practitioner was interested in his chosen
        materials for their “experimented” properties, it makes sense that
        alabaster, an elite stone closely associated with marble and celebrated
        for its ability to produce luminous and delicate carving in a sacred and
        commemorative context, would be assumed to have finer and more
        “excellent” properties for molding than the much more easily attainable
        plaster, which was not used for art objects of as high status and
        caliber as its chemically identical counterpart. Moreover, the symbolic
        and biblical connotations of the material, connected to the
        transformation of the bodies of the faithful through resurrection, could
        have held special interest for the author-practitioner, as he
        experiments with the transformation of materials in many experiments.
        Therefore, it is perhaps this symbolic potency of alabaster that leads
        him to assume that it produces more “excellent” sand than plaster. This
        raises the question of whether the author-practitioner had actually
        experimented with this sand or was simply hypothesizing that it would be
        a fine material. A comparison of the entry on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/83r/f/83r/tl"><u>83r</u></a>,
        or that using ox bone and rock salt on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/89r/f/89r/tl"><u>89r</u></a>,
        with certain other recipes, such as that for “Sand for lead, the most
        excellent of all, for high and low reliefs” on fols. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/84v/f/84v/tl"><u>84v</u></a>–<a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/85r/f/85r/tl"><u>85r</u></a>,

           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/86v/f/86v/tl"><u>86v</u></a>,
        reveals a striking difference in rhetorical style. While the alabaster
        recipe and the ox bone recipe contain relatively clear, step-by-step
        instructions in declarative statements and specific ratios of materials,
        they do not include the full narration of first-person work found in the
        entries on fols. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/84v/f/84v/tl"><u>84v</u></a>–<a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/85r/f/85r/tl"><u>85r</u></a>

           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/86v/f/86v/tl"><u>86v</u></a>.
        These recipes describe multiple trials with accounts of failures and
        successes.<a href="#fn37"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref37"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>37</sup></a> The author-practitioner makes

        this to indicate that he had actually attempted certain sand recipes,
        while others he had merely collected, perhaps for posterity, perhaps for
        later experimentation. The use of alabaster was perhaps merely a thought
        experiment, as he thought about materials within the characteristic sand
        paradigm of finely powdered substance mixed with a binder, and
        considered what materials might translate well into mold making. As our
        reconstruction showed, alabaster sand is certainly functional, but
        perhaps no more “excellent” than others.</p>

                <p>A comparison with commercially calcined bone and oyster shell
                    revealed that some powders are so fine that it is hard to
                    register contact with the surface of the material by touch.
                    This seems to be the indication for what a truly
                    “impalpable” sand should feel like. The manuscript
                    references impalpability in a variety of recipes concerning
                    the many formulas for sands for casting, on fols. <a

                    It is logical that such “impalpability” is sought for, as
                    the finer-grained the mold material, the neater and more
                    detailed the cast impression will be.<a href="#fnref9"

                <p>A later trial resulted in a fair amount of alabaster that had
                    to be thrown away because the water was added too quickly
                    and the whole amount of powder grew warm to the touch and
                    began to harden, the same exothermic reaction that occurs
                    when mixing plaster. We came to the conclusion that time is
                    needed for the transformation of this material to take
                    place, as slow humidifying allows for salt crystals to grow
                    and bind the material, preventing an exothermic reaction
                    resulting in the formation of hardening plaster.<a

                <p>The appropriate consistency for sand is described by
                    Biringuccio as follows: “When [the sand] has been made as
                    desired in this way it is moistened again before use with
                    water, urine, or vinegar just enough so that it holds
                    together when it is squeezed in the fist. Then, when it has
                    been brought to this point, it is moulded as you will hear.”
