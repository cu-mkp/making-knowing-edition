        <div>
            <p>This essay explores a material called rouge clair, which is
                discussed in three separate entries in Ms. Fr. 640 on fols. <a

                and <a

                The term usually refers to a vitreous substance used for
                enameling, but the author-practitioner’s instructions complicate
                this definition: they include its use as a “cold enamel” that
                could be painted on metal without the use of heat. By
                reconstructing these entries and testing the application of the
                rouge clair produced, we conclude that for the
                author-practitioner, rouge clair did not necessarily refer to a
                specific substance (vitreous enamel), but rather to an optical
                effect that could be produced by different materials.</p>

    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
    <p>Three recipes in Ms. Fr. 640 refer to <em>rouge clair</em>, a term that
        today means a vitreous red enamel applied over gold. On the evidence of
        these three entries, this essay will show that in the early modern
        period this term could refer to either true vitreous red enamel or a
        substance with similar optical qualities.<a href="#fn1"
           class="footnote-ref"

           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/6r/f/6r/tl"><u>6r</u></a>

        for “rouge clair” (to which the author-practitioner apparently later
        added “<em>esmail</em>” [enamel]) which calls for heat processing of a
        red glass. The difference between these three recipes underscores the
        variety of meanings that <em>esmail</em> could have in the sixteenth
        century.<a href="#fn2"

    <h2 id="rouge-clair-and-gold">Rouge Clair and Gold</h2>
    <p>The entry on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/124v/f/124v/tl"><u>124v</u></a>,
        although entitled “Rouge clair enamel,” seems to be mostly about gold.
        This should not surprise us because, as Susie Nash notes, the term
        <em>rouge cler</em> during the late fourteenth and early fifteenth
        centuries referred to “the costly red translucent enamel that was a
        relatively new and much prized technique, and which could only be
        applied to gold.”<a href="#fn3"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref3"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> In the sixteenth century,
        Benvenuto Cellini described rouge clair in his <em>Treatises on
            Goldsmithing and Sculpture</em> as a technique of goldsmiths
        consisting of a red enamel known for its unsurpassed beauty and
        clarity.<a href="#fn4"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref4"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> While the linking of rouge clair
        and gold on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/124v/f/124v/tl"><u>124v</u></a>
        is unsurprising, it is significant for the purposes of this essay that
        the author-practitioner advises against the use of pure gold “which is
        opposed” to the rouge clair which “remains yellowish
        [<em>iaulnastre</em>],” and “renders the enamel a dead color.” Instead,
        “alloyed gold is more appropriate for it, such as that of <em>écu</em>
        &amp; <em>pistolet</em> [coins made of gold alloy].” Through this
        discussion of the gold base for the enamel, the optical properties of
        rouge clair emerge. The author-practitioner notes that “one puts it back
        on the fire to give it a reddish color [<em>rougeastre</em>], to make
        the enamels beautiful. <sup>Otherwise, they are matte</sup>.” The
        author-practitioner’s addition of “matte” (<em>mat</em>) here in
        opposition to “beautiful” (<em>beaulx</em>) makes clear that a beautiful
        rouge clair should be a lively red translucent substance. While the
        entry on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/124v/f/124v/tl"><u>124v</u></a>
        provides no clue to ingredients of the rouge clair, it probably refers
        to a vitreous red enamel colored by copper (<em>smalto roggio</em>), an
        extant example of which is found in a fourteenth-century Royal Gold Cup
        made in France, now in the collection of the British Museum (<i><u>Fig. 1</u></i>). The author-practitioner, however, continues to focus
        on gold, adding that some rouge clair “can be found that have grains of
        gold inside, and it is also the opinion of good goldsmiths that the good
        one is made with gold.”</p>

    <p>In contrast to fol. 124v, the recipes on fols. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/40v/f/40v/tl"><u>40v</u></a>
        and fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/6r/f/6r/tl"><u>6r</u></a>
        do not involve heat, nor a vitrification process, but instead are
        similar to paint and paint glaze (paint diluted with additional oil or
        resin). On fol. 40v, the entry for “Cross of the commanders of Malta”
        observes that the “beautiful rouge clair which makes the field of the
        white enamel cross” is created from</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>fine tear of dragon’s blood tempered with eau-de-vie or else Indian
            <em>laque platte</em>, which in my opinion is made in Flanders,
            tempered with clear turpentine &amp; tear of mastic &amp; laid down
            on a silver leaf, not the kind which the painters use, but a thicker
            kind, which is burnished by those who make gemstone foils <em>
                <del>Av</del>
            </em> or by goldsmiths, &amp; that gives it this beautiful
            brilliance.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>Here the author practitioner makes clear
        that this color should have a “beautiful brilliance” supplied by the
        reflective surface of the thick silver.</p>
    <p>The full-page entry on fol. 6r “For laying down and seating burnished
        gold and giving red or green or blue,” which, like the entry on fol.
        124v is mostly about gold rather than the colors to be painted on it,
        specifies</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>if you want to lay in rouge clair &amp; glaze with it <em>
                <del>de</del>
            </em>, grind Venice <em>laque platte</em> on marble with walnut or
            linseed oil. Once ground, mix turpentine or spike lavender varnish
            &amp; apply on the gold with the paintbrush. Brazilwood &amp;
            <em>laque ronde</em> die.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>In avoiding the pigments brazilwood and
        <em>laque ronde</em>, this entry repeats the warning to avoid materials
        that will create a “dead color” elaborated on fol. 124v, thus making
        clear the aim of these entries for a substance of a deep red, “lively”
        color. Moreover, the metal surfaces (silver for dragon’s blood and
        burnished gold for Venice <em>laque platte</em>) will provide similarly
        brilliant reflective surfaces that shine through the translucency of the
        “rouge clair.”</p>
    <p>Taken together, then, these three recipes complicate our understanding of
        enamels generally, and of rouge clair specifically, as only fol. 124v
        involves heat and vitrification, something that today we would expect to
        be part of any process for producing rouge clair. Given that the other
        two entries are for paint-like materials, what does this term “rouge
        clair” mean to the author-practitioner? This essay addresses this
        question first by examining other related entries in Ms. Fr. 640, and
        second by reconstructing the recipes on fols. 6r and 40v. This
        reconstruction provides a better understanding of the optical effects of
        resin- and oil-based paints on metal surfaces. In addition to
        illuminating the author-practicioner’s understanding of rouge clair,
        this essay contributes to more general questions about the
        author-practicioner’s understanding of <em>esmail</em> that are further
        explored in Amy Chang’s essay, “What is <em>esmail</em>?”<a href="#fn5"

    <h2 id="rouge-clair-recipes-in-ms.-fr.-640">Rouge Clair Recipes in Ms. Fr.
        640</h2>
    <p>The three entries for rouge clair are spread across the manuscript, and
        the entries that appear around them differ significantly. The recipe on
        fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/40v/f/40v/tl"><u>40v</u></a>,
        “Cross of the commanders of Malta” that calls for laying in dragon’s
        blood-based paint on silver, is preceded by recipes on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/39v/f/39v/tl"><u>39v</u></a>
        that include “Enamel,” “Colors for illumination on glass,” and “Tracing
        some history on glass,” and on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/40r/f/40r/tl"><u>40r</u></a>
        for “Buttons of <em>vermeilles</em>” (red glass buttons). The entries on
        the following folio <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/41r/f/41r/tl"><u>41r</u></a>–<a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/41v/f/41v/tl"><u>v</u></a>
        include casting and molding recipes, as well as “Glassworkers’ black,”
        and “Colors and gilding on glass.” While there are many less clearly
        related entries on these folios, including for grottos, ducks,
        aquafortis, and vinegar, this sampling of entries around “Cross of the
        commanders of Malta” suggests that the author-practitioner placed this
        particular recipe for “beautiful rouge clair which makes the field of
        the white enamel cross” in proximity to entries for painting on glass,
        perhaps thereby conceptualizing it as related to both painting and glass
        processes. Indeed, the method of reverse painting on glass described on
        fols. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/39v/f/39v/tl"><u>39v</u></a>–<a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/40r/f/40r/tl"><u>40r</u></a>
        is explicitly connected to the vitreous enamel technique
        <em>basse-taille</em>.<a href="#fn6"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref6"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> Similarly, oil- and resin-based
        paints (often referred to as “cold enamels”) were applied to cast metal
        objects to add greater naturalism, enhancing the object with translucent
        color that allowed the metal underneath to be seen, perhaps in imitation
        of applying rouge clair on an underlayer of metal leaf.<a href="#fn7"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref7"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
    <p>The recipe on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/6r/f/6r/tl"><u>6r</u></a>,
        “For laying down and seating burnished gold and giving red or green or
        blue,” which uses a Venice lake-based paint in oil, is located between
        entries on mirrors on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/5r/f/5r/tl"><u>5r</u></a>,
        and, on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/6v/f/6v/tl"><u>6v</u></a>,
        for embellishing cages with thin glass (<em>esmail</em>) canes of
        various colors. Although mirrors may seem unrelated to rouge clair, the
        author-practitioner is interested in mirrors for the optical effects
        they produce: “an endless number of pretty conceits which seem magic.”
        His entries on mirrors and on rouge clair laid down on metal backings
        may both thus relate to his interest in optical effects. More obviously
        relevant to rouge clair are the vitreous enamels to which he alludes in
        the description on fol. 6v of a process to bend thin enamel canes “by
        the heat of a lamp.” This process, now known as lampworking, is a
        technique for which the author-practitioner notes “glass button makers
        also avail themselves of the said furnace.”<a href="#fn8"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref8"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
    <p>The focus on glass and on optical effects in these various entries
        surrounding fols. 6r and 40v may indicate that the author-practitioner
        sees a similarity or relationship between the concept of rouge clair and
        the glass and metal entries. As we shall see, that relationship is in
        the nature of the optical effects they produce.</p>
    <p>Red enamel (designated as <em>esmail</em> rather than <em>rouge
            clair</em>) also appears in the manuscript on fols. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/3r/f/3r/tl"><u>3r</u></a>
        and <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/39r/f/39r/tl"><u>39r</u></a>.
        The recipe on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/3r/f/3r/tl"><u>3r</u></a>
        mentions it in relation to “Counterfeit coral,” where the
        author-practitioner includes a note that “the coral made of gules red
        enamel endures the file and polishing.” The red enamel mentioned here,
        <em>esmail de gueule</em>, known in English as “gules red enamel,”<a
           href="#fn9"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref9"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> differs from rouge clair in that
        it is not translucent but opaque. An entry entitled “Goldsmith” on fol.
        <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/39r/f/39r/tl"><u>39r</u></a>
        observes that, “when goldsmiths have thus assembled their silver filings
        with saltpeter, a red enamel [<em>esmail rouge</em>] vitrifies at the
        bottom of the crucible.” He then adds, “I do not know if the copper
        mixed in with the silver is the cause,” making a note to himself to “Try
        for enamel.” Here again, he seems to be referring to red glass colored
        by copper (<em>smalto roggio</em>). While these entries mentioning red
        enamels use some of the same materials as the rouge clair recipes, they
        can be either translucent or opaque. This comparison thus underscores
        the characteristic translucence that the author-practitioner sees as
        typifying rouge clair.</p>
    <h2 id="reconstruction">Reconstruction</h2>
    <h3 id="pigments">Pigments </h3>
    <p>The pigments the author-practitioner calls for are ambiguous: the recipe
        on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/6r/f/6r/tl"><u>6r</u></a>
        calls for <em>laque platte de venise</em>, which we identified as red
        lake pigment sold at the time in a small flat cake rather than a round
        form (<em>laque platte</em> vs. <em>laque ronde</em>).<a href="#fn10"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref10"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> Ms. Fr. 640 mentions that
        Florence lake (<em>laque de florence</em>) is better than Flanders lake
        because the best dyes are made in Florence (see fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/57v/f/57v/tl"><u>57v</u></a>),
        thus it seems that the author-practitioner refers to specific lakes by
        their place of production, and thus <em>laque de venise</em> is lake
        from Venice, and Florence lake is superior to that from Venice. In the
        late fifteenth and early sixteenth century, Venice also produced dyes,
        and was famous for its high-quality red lakes.<a href="#fn11"

    <h3 id="tools">Tools</h3>
    <p>Having decided on our colorants, we turned to the tools for applying the
        rouge clair onto the metal surfaces. We experimented with brushes, our
        gloved fingers, and palette knives. The brush was inappropriate, because
        it not only created brush lines but also retained a large amount of
        pigment. Similarly, our fingers did not work very well as the
        application was uneven and left clear traces when we lifted our fingers
        from the surface. Overall, the palette knife proved most effective
        because it provided control over the application and did not absorb
        pigment.</p>
    <h2 id="optical-effects">Optical Effects</h2>
    <p>Our reconstructions of the two recipes on fols. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/6r/f/6r/tl"><u>6r</u></a>
        and <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/40v/f/40v/tl"><u>40v</u></a>
        for rouge clair confirmed the hints about the author-practitioner’s
        conception of “rouge clair” that had emerged from our textual analysis:
        both recipes yielded deep-hued, lively red—ruby-like—translucent glassy
        surfaces through which their metal substrates reflected brilliantly.
        Although these two recipes use different materials—one is oil-based
        (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/6r/f/6r/tl"><u>6r</u></a>),
        and the other is resin-based (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/40v/f/40v/tl"><u>40v</u></a>)—and
        our reconstructions resulted in two materially different rouge clairs,
        they had almost identical color and translucency when freshly made (<i><u>Fig. 2</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 3</u></i>). Over time, however, the
        resin-based rouge clair came to more closely resemble the structural
        properties of vitreous enamel, in that it formed a thick hard surface,
        while the oil-based rouge clair remained comparatively thin and fragile.

    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>Further experimentation indicated that it
        was in fact the mastic that determined the depth, liveliness, and
        translucency of the color. This is corroborated by Mary Merrifield’s
        statement that</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>gum is used for illuminating and giving lustre and brilliancy to the
            colours which are heightened and rendered gay by the gum; just as
            varnish gives a beautiful lustre to oil paintings, serving as gauze
            and talc to defend them from the dust; and as crystal, to give
            lustre and light to that which seems gloomy and eclipsed.<a

    <p>The reconstruction also demonstrated how different proportions of
        colorants, binding materials, and backings could change the depth of the
        red hue (<i><u>Fig. 5</u></i>). In order to produce deep, lively,
        translucent ruby red, the proportion of binder that gave the vitreous
        effect could be of greater importance than the colorant. For instance,
        too much dragon’s blood and not enough mastic created an extremely dark
        crimson color (<i><u>Fig. 6</u></i>).</p>

        Optical Effects – Ground Layers</h3>
    <p>The ground layers—gold, silver, and gesso—also played a significant role
        in creating the desired optical effects as well. Benvenuto Cellini said
        that red enamels pair better with gold,<a href="#fn25"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref25"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a> and the entry on fol. 124v
        discusses gold with vitreous rouge clair, but the resin-based rouge
        clair on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/40v/f/40v/tl"><u>40v</u></a>,
        specifies using silver leaf, but “not the kind which the painters use,
        but a thicker kind, which is burnished by those who make gemstone foils
        or by goldsmiths, &amp; that gives it this beautiful brilliance.”
        Despite distinguishing between silver and gold grounds, the
        author-practitioner does not compare or describe the difference that
        gold and silver will make in terms of different optical effects. To
        better understand this, we tested both recipes on gold and silver, as
        well as on plain gessoed panel. Our reconstructions showed that the red
        of the “cold” rouge clair recipes appeared bright, lively, and glassy
        over both gold and silver leaf when freshly made (see Figs. 2 and 3).
        However, after drying, the appearance changed. When freshly laid on, the
        paint on the gold leaf resulted in a slightly more vivid red than the
        silver leaf, but after drying, the dragon’s blood on silver became
        darker (<i><u>Fig. 7</u></i>), while the color applied directly to the
        gesso board looked dull and no longer had a glass-like appearance after
        drying. The gold or silver base seemed to be especially necessary to the
        oil-based rouge clair in order to preserve its liveliness (<i><u>Fig. 8</u></i>). Through our reconstructions, we concluded that cold
        rouge clair had a more vivid color and vitreous visual effect on gold.
        The silver surface also worked well, although it seemed to be especially
        well-suited to a deeper colored red (which the resin-based dragon’s
        blood rouge clair became over time). The gessoed board did not provide
        the same reflective surface of the two metal leafs, and thus did not
        produce the intended optical effect.</p>

        application on silver yielded a slightly darker red. Perhaps the
        author-practitioner recommended silver on fol. 40v for the same reason
        that in the vitreous rouge clair recipe on fol. 124v he employed alloyed
        gold because the use of pure gold rendered the enamel a yellowish and
        “dead color.” His concern with the weaker optical effect of this dead
        color can also be found in the instructions on fol. 6r not to use
        brazilwood and <em>laque ronde</em> because they “die.” The
        author-practitioner’s worry that this red might die appears to allude to
        a material imaginary, also underlying other entries in Ms. Fr. 640, that
        associated red substances with blood and life. In this imaginary,
        current in sixteenth-century medicine and metalworking, red and blood
        were also associated with gold. That rouge clair was applied on gold

    <p>Paint with similar properties to both the oil-based and resin-based rouge
        clairs of Ms. Fr. 640 has been found on the sixteenth-century table
        ornament by Wenzel Jamnitzer, now in the collection of the Rijksmuseum,
        Amsterdam (<i><u>Fig. 9</u></i>). Oil-based “cold enamel” occurs inside
        one of the domed caps for the shields, and some of the orange-red paint
        identified on this piece contains colophony, a type of resin.<a

    <p>In sum, both the author-practitioner’s comments in Ms. Fr. 640 and the
        results of our reconstructions led to the conclusion that the rouge
        clair recipes sought to create specific optical effects, and that, for
        the author-practitioner, rouge clair did not necessarily denote a type
        of red vitreous enamel or the materials that went into producing it.
        Instead, he meant by it a saturated, lively, and translucent ruby red
        that possessed optical properties characteristic of glass and gemstones.
        Compared to the oil-based rouge clair (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/6r/f/6r/tl"><u>6r</u></a>),
        the resin-based substance described on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/40v/f/40v/tl"><u>40v</u></a>
        forms a hard glass-like material, which has been identified on objects
        from the period, and was used as an alternative to vitreous enamels.<a

        supplemented our understanding of resin-based paint on metal, a use that
        might have advantages in certain circumstances over both vitreous enamel
        and oil-based paints, due to the resin-based paint’s properties of quick
        drying, durability, and ability to create a plausible imitation of
        glass.</p>

                    of the transparent red enamel, which it is said, was
                    discovered by an alchemist who was a goldsmith as well. But
                    all I need tell of it is that this alchemist, while engaged
                    in the search of how to make gold, had mixed together a
                    certain composition, and when his work was done, there
                    appeared among the stuff in the metal rest of his crucible a
                    sediment of the loveliest red glass, just as we see it to
                    this day. After much time and trouble, and by many mixings
                    of it with other enamels the goldsmith finally discovered
                    the process of making it. This enamel is far the most
                    beautiful of all, and is termed in the goldsmiths’ art
                    ‘<em>smalto roggio</em>,’ red enamel, or in French
                    ‘<em>rogia chlero</em>’ (rouge clair) that is to say, and
                    which means in other words, red and clear or transparent.”<a

                <p>Affordability may also be relevant to the fact that the
                    so-called “painted enamels” made in sixteenth-century
                    Limoges (i.e., vitreous enamels) generally used silver base
                    layers rather than gold or copper. See Erika Speel,

                    Tamar Davidowitz, however, not enough study has been made of
                    silver objects painted with translucent cold enamels, thus
                    with more research, other reasons for using silver might
                    come to light. See Tamar Davidowitz, “Painted Silver: The

                <p>Davidowitz, “Painted Silver,” 9–10. Based on Davidowitz’s
                    object study, the red over the silver leaf deteriorated and
                    paled. See Davidowitz, “Painted Silver,” 15. This seems to
                    accord with the author-practitioner’s statement on fol. 29v
                    that “When it is applied on burnished gold, it is prone to
                    break. For this reason, some coat it with turpentine
                    varnish.” In contrast, in our reconstructions, the
                    resin-based pigment seemed to be more durable because it
                    formed a hard solid once dried.<a href="#fnref30"
