    <p><i>PLEASE NOTE: this essay contains images and description of preparing dead animals for taxidermy - it may be disturbing to some.</i></p>
    
    <p>Techniques of modern taxidermy have not changed much from the ways of
        ancient preparators. An animal is skinned, flesh and fatty elements
        removed, skin is then preserved, and the skin is sewn up around a form
        (anatomical replica). The techniques in BnF Ms. Fr. 640 stand somewhere
        between mummification and taxidermy. In “Animals dried in an oven” (fol.
        <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/130r/f/130r/tl"><u>130r</u></a>),
        the entry calls for the removal of the “eyes &amp; all their entrails”
        (which would go rancid) but leaves the muscle and other tissues intact
        (these essentially turn into “jerky” or mummify as they dry in the
        oven).</p>
    <p>As a taxidermist, I was most fascinated by the use of gravity and hanging
        the specimen upside down in order to create a balanced standing figure
        when it was dry. Modern taxidermists will dry certain bird and mammal
        mounts hung upside down in order to make feathers or fur stand a
        particular way; however, in such cases, the interior is a synthetic foam
        form instead of the hardened muscle and tissue—modern taxidermy removes
        all of this, the only thing used is the skin.<a href="#fn1"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref1"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
    <p>The painted lead and wax balls as eyes were interesting too, as the
        author-practitioner instructs: “Next, one places in the hollow of the
        eyes balls of lead or of wax, painted according to nature. One paints
        them with well-gummed ink so that they seem to be jet” (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/130r/f/130r/tl"><u>130r</u></a>).
        Today, modern taxidermists are similarly concerned with making the
        prepared animal look lifelike through the use of realistic eyes, which
        now are made of glass, acrylic, resin, and more. Making naturalistic
        eyes for taxidermy has become a whole industry in itself.</p>
    <p>There has been a resurgence in gaff making and fantasy style taxidermy,
        creating hybrid creatures like jackalopes, two-headed creatures, or
        winged foxes. Many attribute gaff making to Coney Island sideshows or
        Victorian whimsy, but seeing the author-practitioner’s suggestions that
        “one gives it a painted tongue, horns, wings &amp; similar fancies. Thus
        for rats &amp; all animals,” proves that human fascination with hybrid
        animals is probably much older than our documentation of it.</p>
    <p>Ms. Fr. 640 gets closer to modern taxidermy in the recipes for “Keeping
        birds and animals” (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/48r/f/48r/tl"><u>48r</u></a>):
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><em>
                <del>skin them</del>
            </em> Take a measurement of their body, which is fleshy &amp; more
            subject to decay, with some canvas that you will cut to their size
            &amp; width. And having <em>
                <del>cou</del>
            </em> filled it with cotton &amp; sewn it, skin them, <del>birds
            </del> leaving, however, the head, the neck, the wings &amp; the
            feet on the birds, &amp; the head, the legs &amp; the feet &amp;
            tail on the animals, because those dry easily. Then fit that skin on
            the <em>
                <del>a</del>
            </em>
            <del>you</del> mold made of canvas. Small ones are dried in an oven
            or prepared with sal ammoniac &amp; <em>[illegible]</em>.
        </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>In this entry, the author-practitioner
        removes the entire torso of the animal and creates something close to a
        taxidermy form out of canvas firmly packed with cotton. He keeps the
        head and limbs to dry out in the oven or with a chemical preparation.
        This comes a bit nearer to some nineteenth-century taxidermy methods in
        which skins were removed from the body, cleaned, defatted, and washed in
        arsenic soap, then mounted onto forms made of tightly bound wood, wool,
        and metal wire. Perhaps the author-practitioner saw shrinkage or an
        undesirable shape in his preparations, and thus his methods evolved?</p>
    <p>The closest Ms. Fr. 640 comes to modern taxidermy is the marginal note on
        “Molding a bird” (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/157v/f/157v/tl"><u>157v</u></a>):
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>They are skinned &amp; filled with cotton cloth. &amp; even better,
            one needs to dress them in the fashion that curriers do, in order
            that they do not lose a feather, weight. The dressing is alum &amp;
            paste of flour.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>Even today, tans and preservative powders
        include alum (along with other chemicals), and preparing a hide for
        taxidermy is somewhat similar to tanning a large skin for leatherwork.
        There are differences in thickness, quality, and other aspects, but the
        technique of using a chemical to preserve the skin is the same. The
        proper preservation of a skin is crucial to making sure it is long
        lasting, and that fur or feathers do not fall out due to decomposition,
        deterioration, or the pH of the preservative being too acidic or basic.
    </p>
    <p>Interestingly, this marginal note to “Molding a bird” (fol. 157v) about
        the skinning and stuffing of the bird is actually part of a molding
        recipe:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>One needs to give it its shape. And to do this, place it on its side
            on a clay slab, and hide &amp; sink within it half the said bird,
            <sup>in order</sup> that it only shows one leg &amp; one foot, then
            you will anoint it with butter to make it hold the feathers down,
            finally <del>ofoil</del> eau-de-vie. And then cast. And being set,
            clean &amp; uncover whatever needs it. Next, mold the other side in
            the same way. But because the feet, being of bone that is difficult
            to burn &amp; which are not able to be cleaned neither by
            quicksilver <del>If</del> nor by any other means, if the mold would
            not open, uncover the bottom of the feet &amp; the toe or the little
            finger of the claw, &amp; mold as a separate piece. Reheat &amp;
            open your mold &amp; clean the bones. The feet usually remain too
            weak to support the mass of a solid bird. And for this reason, one
            adapts an iron wire in the mold of the feet which passes into the
            body before casting; thus, they are reinforced. Some mold the wings
            in a frame. Others mold the head &amp; the said wings separately
            <em>en noyau</em> [in a one-piece plaster mold], then join &amp;
            repair them to first model a form that will be stiff &amp; withstand
            the tempered sand.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>This could be a modern tutorial on mold
        making in taxidermy if the materials used were alginate, silicone,
        plaster, etc. This recipe is one of my favorites because it seems like
        the author-practitioner is making a reference cast or replica, so he can
        recreate a bird more realistically. Modern taxidermists use similar mold
        making techniques to create taxidermy forms, or to make “death masks” of
        the parts of animals that tend to shrink in death (noses, paws, parts of
        the face). These casts are used to help rebuild the anatomy so the
        animal appears as lifelike as possible. This may also be a means of
        preserving an animal that is not available all year round, a concern
        expressed by the author-practitioner in “Molding snakes in all weather”
        (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/116v/f/116v/tl"><u>116v</u></a>),
        where he notes methods for producing lifecast snakes in the winter when
        snakes “hide in the earth.”<a href="#fn2"

    <h2 id="reconstruction">Reconstruction</h2>
    <p>As the Making and Knowing Project’s Expert Maker in fall 2016, I
        reconstructed the process on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/130r/f/130r/tl"><u>130r</u></a>
        with the Making and Knowing laboratory seminar:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Animals dried in an oven</p>
        <p>Small <em>
                <del>s</del>
            </em> cats are skinned and one removes their eyes &amp; all their
            entrails. One puts a small stick vertically between their teeth to
            make them open their mouths wide. Then with iron points one attaches
            their feet to a small board, giving them the fitting attitude &amp;
            gait. Once thus attached by their feet <sup>with small rings of iron
                wire thus [small sketch inserted], which, surrounding the
                fingers of the paws, stick in the jacket of clay</sup>, one
            needs to suspend them in the sun with the backbone downward. In this
            manner they take <em>
                <del>&amp;d</del>
            </em> their shape &amp; dry, &amp; the belly tightens &amp; the tail
            remains high <sup>or with the bend that you will have given
                it</sup>. Once a little dry by this means, one turns the head as
            one wants, securing it with some tool. Then one finishes drying it
            in an oven when the bread is drawn. Next, one places in the hollow
            of the eyes balls of lead or of wax, painted according to nature.
            One paints them with well-gummed ink so that they seem to be jet.
            One gives it a painted tongue, horns, wings &amp; similar fancies.
            Thus for rats &amp; all animals.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>At the time of this reconstruction (<i><u>Fig. 1</u></i>), the Making and Knowing Project did not
        understand the difference between the three entries (fols. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/130r/f/130r/tl"><u>130r</u></a>,
        <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/48r/f/48r/tl"><u>48r</u></a>,
        and <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/157v/f/157v/tl"><u>157v</u></a>)
        and their two different methods of preparing an animal. Only fol. 130r
        specifies that the bones and muscles should be left in the skin to give
        structure; the other two entries (fols. 48r and 157v) replace bone and
        muscle with a shaped pouch filled with stuffing. Because at that time we
        understood the entries to give instructions about separate parts of a
        single process, we mixed techniques from the three different entries.

    <h2 id="epilogue">Epilogue</h2>
    <p>The results of Divya Anantharamam’s residence as Expert Maker with the
        Making and Knowing Project have become an enduring source of fascination
        in the Making and Knowing lab and demonstrate one of the important
        sixteenth-century aims of creating such realistic hybrid animals. Like
        the lifecasting that fixed short lived creatures such as butterflies in
        metal,<a href="#fn6"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref6"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> these hybrid creations invite
        speculation about the relationship between the artifice of nature and
        the artifice of the human hand. In early modern Europe, both lifecasts
        and these hybrid animals were collected and displayed in
        <em>Kunstkammern</em>—chambers of art—that brought together
