        <div>
            <p>Using the abundant data made available by the Making and Knowing
                Project, this essay examines some of the rhetorical features of
                Ms. Fr. 640, with a focus on <em>dispositio</em>. It argues
                that, when applied to a single document, careful visualization
                of statistical data can promote a “synthetic” approach to texts.
                Applied to Ms. Fr. 640, these computational methods provide
                readers with tools to assess relations between the manuscript’s
                constitutive parts and its cohesion as a whole. In doing so,
                this essay contributes to broadening the scope of
                computer-assisted hermeneutics in data-rich editions.</p>

    <p>The code underlying digital editions raises the prospect of radically new
        approaches to the text.<a href="#fn1"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref1"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> This alluring vision has prompted
        numerous attempts at incorporating data science into the study of the
        written word. Indeed, not indifferent to the quantitative trend that
        transformed many of the social and natural sciences over the past
        decades, scholars in the humanities have pondered in turn how the
        statistical data collected from digital editions could inform their
        approach to textual analysis and, by extension, renew their discipline.
        The latter motive, in particular, galvanized literary historians to jump
        on the digital bandwagon and head for the hills, so to speak, from where
        they hoped to observe sceneries until then never perceived. Franco
        Moretti and Matthew Jockers are often cited as typical examples of this
        movement, respectively coining their approaches “distant reading” and
        “macroanalysis.”<a href="#fn2"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref2"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
    <p>These approaches were meant, at least at their inception, to propose a
        radical departure from the tradition of literary criticism by tapping
        into the potential of digitization and statistics to vastly increase the
        scale of textual analysis. According to Jockers, the development of
        macro-analysis is in a sense comparable to that of macroeconomics,
        insofar as the two disciplines focus on aggregates rather than
        individual parts.<a href="#fn3"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref3"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> Distant readers, in other words,
        think big. They are drawn to gargantuan corpora made of hundreds of
        texts, and tend to leave aside the older and more conventional scale of
        philology, namely the single text or the oeuvre. According to Franco
        Moretti, dealing with extreme scales has become the very signature of
        the digital humanities.<a href="#fn4"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref4"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
    <p>Such taste for extremes can be misleading, however, as the notion of
        scale is relative and not always well defined. The literature of the
        Spanish Golden Age, for example, would make an indisputably lengthy
        corpus to examine. But in no way would a fraction of that corpus, say
        one limited to the works of Lope de Vega, the period’s most prolific
        author, be necessarily less daunting or difficult to apprehend by an
        individual using conventional methods. His comedies alone extend over
        fifteen volumes, and his complete works would no doubt fill an entire
        shelf. In fact, the main difference between the two examples is less in
        the length of the corpora than in their alleged scope: one would
        authorize scholars to discuss a single oeuvre, whereas the other would
        entitle them (assuming they devise a statistically representative sample
        of texts) to make claims about much broader literary and historical
        categories. This distinction between length and scope would suffice if
        one assumed that characters, words, and sentences work as reliable units
        of measurement across different textual media.</p>
    <p>However, this assumption overlooks a third dimension of textual data,
        namely, its density.<a href="#fn5"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref5"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> The density of a digital edition
        can be easily understood if one compares it to digital images. Some
        digital images use more pixels per square inch and record a wider
        spectrum of colors than others. Similarly, while some digital editions
        are made of unstructured plain-text files, others are formatted in a
        language that enables corpora to integrate much more information about
        the text, its material, linguistic, semantic, and genetic aspects, such
        as layout, structure, variants, marginal notes, paper, ink, watermarks,
        fonts, part of speech, lexical fields, etc.<a href="#fn6"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref6"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> Crucially, variables such as
        density, scope, and length do not necessarily form a proportional
        relationship, as data-rich corpora can be smaller in scope, and/or
        length and yet provide considerably more information to process. As a
        consequence, many of the invisible patterns, trends, and structures that
        distant readers seek to uncover experimenting with very large corpora
        can also be pursued at smaller, more “anthropocentric” scales.</p>
    <p>The question remains, however, as to what kind of scholarly insights
        statistical methods may yield at lesser magnitudes. Using the abundant
        and expertly-curated data made available by the Making and Knowing
        Project, this essay argues that, when applied to a single manuscript,
        visualization of statistical data promotes a synthetic approach to the
        text, by virtue of which readers can fathom the relations between the
        document as a whole and its constitutive parts. In this regard, BnF
        Ms.&nbsp;Fr.&nbsp;640 is particularly germane, since the manuscript
        document is hard to grasp as a coherent ensemble. At first sight, the
        information the author-practitioner apparently compiled looks fragmented
        and randomly distributed. Yet, is this apparent lack of structure a sign
        of rhetorical neglect? In other words, is Ms.&nbsp;Fr.&nbsp;640
        approachable as a literary object: with its voices, intentions,
        addressees, and persuasive strategies? To answer these questions, I will
        first briefly situate early modern technical literature in its broader
        rhetorical context. Second, I will show how visualization methods based
        on the edition’s own metadata enable a synthetic approach to the
        manuscript that addresses some of the questions raised above. Third, I
        will argue that, while data-rich editions greatly facilitate this kind
        of synthetic interpretation, they should not rely on editorial markup or
        on algorithms alone but rather on a dialectic relation between the two.

        Rhetoric, Tacit Knowledge, and the Development of Technical Literature
    </h2>
    <p>How does one communicate technical knowledge effectively? For many
        sixteenth-century practitioners, book learning may have appeared
        unsuited or at least poorly equipped to transmit know-how, since words
        alone can hardly convey the many intricacies and contingencies of
        practice.<a href="#fn7"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref7"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> Even today, in practice-oriented
        settings, verbal instruction is rarely considered sufficient in and of
        itself if disconnected from the sensorial experience of the workshop:
        apprentices tend to learn the appropriate gestures from masters by
        seeing them in action, and practitioners like to supplement their
        understanding of materials with a visual, tactile, and olfactive
        approach.<a href="#fn8"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref8"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> However, as ineffable as
        practical knowledge may be, the desire to lay it down on paper and to
        share it with a broader public has persisted across the centuries. In
        the early modern period, the development of the printing press only
        exacerbated these literary aspirations, accelerating the development of
        a best selling genre: the book of secrets.<a href="#fn9"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref9"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> In Ms.&nbsp;Fr.&nbsp;640, the
        author-practitioner provides some clues as to why such secrets should
        ultimately be set down in words. In the commonplaces he gathered with an
        eye, most likely, to composing the preface of a book, he explains that,
        by sharing the techniques he tested in his own workshop, his hope is to
        transmit this knowledge to new audiences and to benefit from a “common
        commerce of letters” with like-minded interlocutors.<a href="#fn10"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref10"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> In the author-practitioner’s
        mind, then, the written word remains, in spite of its limitations, the
        primary channel through which a community of practitioners can thrive
        over time.</p>
    <p>What looks like a publication project, however, never came to fruition,
        and the extant manuscript, on which the present edition is based, while
        probably containing most of its building blocks, hardly resembles a
        finished book. Indeed, contrary to most of the printed compilations of
        secrets consulted for this essay, whose <em>copia</em> is visibly
        contained by thematic boundaries, the entries of Ms.&nbsp;Fr.&nbsp;640
        do not seem to be arranged in a systematic way.<a href="#fn11"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref11"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> A quick browse through the
        facsimile gives the reader a sense of how the entries contrast between
        one another, and follow in quick succession without reason or rhyme. On
        fol.&nbsp;104v, for example, the author-practitioner deals with topics
        as varied as curing a dog’s mange, wax casting, goldsmithing, and
        building a musical instrument.</p>
    <p>This seemingly nonchalant approach to the arrangement of ideas and
        arguments (<em>dispositio</em>), one of the central tenets of rhetoric,
        may reinforce the impression that practitioners, because of their
        uncertain social extraction, or because of their often limited exposure
        to the <em>studia humanitatis</em>, were unconcerned with questions of
        eloquence. The potter Bernard Palissy, in the preface to his <em>Recepte
            véritable</em>, makes a claim in this direction when he defines his
        own plain style as unrhetorical:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>I am no Greek, Hebrew, poet, or rhetorician; just a simple and
            illiterate artisan. However, for that very reason, the topic at
            matter has no less virtue than if it were told by a more eloquent
            man. I prefer saying the truth in my rustic language, rather than
            lies in a rhetorical language.<a href="#fn12"
               class="footnote-ref"
               id="fnref12"
               role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>Disdainful rejections of rhetoric such as
        Palissy’s should be taken with a pinch of salt, however. For a start,
        and contrary to a persistent belief, the art of “saying well” (<em>ars
            bene dicendi</em>) was not entirely reserved to the privilege of an
        elite. Many of its principles had long permeated the different strata of
        society, as manuals of eloquence were widely available in the vernacular
        and provided a very practical kind of knowledge in the contexts of
        letter writing, preaching, or sustaining polite conversations, to name
        but a few.<a href="#fn13"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref13"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> In many parts of Europe,
        furthermore, verbal jousting and poetic eloquence were sources of civic
        pride. In cities like Toulouse, where the author-practitioner lived,
        these arts were celebrated in yearly contests and festivities by a
        diverse population who regarded them as major sources of
        entertainment.<a href="#fn14"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref14"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> Probably influenced by Pierre de
        la Ramée’s radical reformation of rhetoric, Palissy’s <em>captatio
            benevolentiae</em> uses the conventional display of modesty that one
        would expect in a preface, but he does so to present rhetoric, not as
        the ancient art of civic conversation that many humanists cherished, but
        as a technique of verbal embellishment at best or, at worst, as an
        elitist art of deception.</p>
    <p>Not all technical writers viewed eloquence this way, however. Girolamo
        Ruscelli, for example, author of immensely popular pseudonymous books of
        secrets, was also deeply committed to promoting vernacular language and
        literature.<a href="#fn15"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref15"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> He composed several books on the
        subject and edited important collections of lyric poetry, such as the
        complete works of Vittoria Colonna.<a href="#fn16"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref16"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> He also took part in lively

           id="fnref17"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> Another example is Leonardo
        Fioravanti, an empirical doctor who relied extensively on the printing
        press to promote his unconventional approach to medicine, inspired by
        alchemy.<a href="#fn18"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref18"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> Fioravanti was keenly aware of
        the rhetorical challenges posed by the transmission of technical
        knowledge. In his <em>Capricci medicinali</em>, a book of medical
        secrets, he explains that the subject at hand necessitated “a new way of
        writing” in which “beautiful proofs” have to be complemented with
        indisputable ones drawn from “hands-on experience.”<a href="#fn19"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref19"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a> Likewise, Leonardo da Vinci’s
        well-known emphasis on experience should not be read as an outright
        rejection of all things literary, but rather as the observation that
        ancient models of eloquence are seldom adapted to technical and
        empirical matters, and that these matters ultimately require new
        wordsmiths. In one of his oft-quoted manuscript prefaces, he warns
        readers against presumptuous naysayers who:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>will claim that, since I do not have a literary background, I am
            incapable of saying well what I want to cover. Yet these people
            don’t know that my writing is drawn from experience rather than from
            someone else’s words. Experience has been the teacher of those who
            used to write well, and thus I choose her as my teacher, and I will
            plead to her every time.<a href="#fn20"
               class="footnote-ref"
               id="fnref20"
               role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>Although Leonardo recognizes that he is no
        expert in classical culture, he does not turn his back on literature per
        se, nor does he renounce his ambition to communicate effectively. If
        Leonardo relied on literary models, these belonged mostly to the
        vernacular tradition and the mercantile world, which included the Tuscan
        <em>ricordanze</em> books, records of important things merchants and
        their families ought to remember, and the <em>zibaldoni</em>, working
        notebooks containing miscellaneous topics and commonplaces.<a
           href="#fn21"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref21"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a> Leonardo’s manuscripts suggest,
        in fact, a great familiarity with the short form: writings characterized
        by their brevity and portability, such as poems, jokes, riddles,
        recipes, fables, prophecies, and aphorisms. These short forms circulated
        orally, in letters, and in printed compilations. Readers would also
        write down selections in their own commonplace books, and in this sense
        such books are at the crossroads of public and private writing. On the
        one hand, they do not seem to follow a predetermined order nor a clear
        logical structure, since their main vocation is to record diverse things
        as they come to hand, mostly for mnemonic purposes. Yet on the other
        hand, they may contain fragments of potential publications, experimental
        writings, including, in the cases of Leonardo’s manuscripts and
        Ms.&nbsp;Fr.&nbsp;640, draft prefaces for prospective books. They
        betray, sometimes, attempts at organizing information according to a
        certain logic. In the section below, I will show that a data-driven
        approach to the text lets us visualize this textual ambivalence, and
        that this visualization ultimately helps to understand the manuscript,
        not only as a random repository of short forms, but potentially also as
        an organic whole.</p>
    <h2 id="visualizing-copia">Visualizing <em>Copia</em></h2>
    <p>Taking a step back from Ms.&nbsp;Fr.&nbsp;640, one can accurately picture
        the way information is distributed in the document. Scatterplots, in
        this regard, offer a straightforward method to represent the manuscript
        (<i><u>Fig. 1</u></i>).<a href="#fn22"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref22"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a> Primarily used to establish a
        correlation between two variables, and eventually to draw predictive
        models, scatterplots are also well suited for the more modest purpose of
        producing basic visual abstractions of written documents in a familiar
        and legible format. In this Cartesian coordinate system, the
        <em>x</em>-axis represents the manuscript’s folios from 1r to 170v. The
        <em>y</em>-axis indicates the length of each entry, which is measured in
        words. Fig. 1 shows that the majority of entries average a length of
        less than 134 words. They constitute, so to speak, the “norm” in this
        manuscript, and typically consist in brief procedural descriptions. More
        importantly, while the “norm” is rather stable throughout the
        manuscript, the proportion of exceptionally longer entries increases
        toward the last third of the document, especially those between the
        average (134) and maximal (2,721) word count per entry. This trend,
        while not impossible to guess reading the text in a conventional way,
        would be hard to communicate without this type of visual evidence.
        Scatterplots offer, in this sense, a standard visual language to
        represent and discuss some of the structural features of a text. By
        adding a third variable, moreover, they allow scholars to test some
        hypothetical correlations. <i><u>Fig. 2</u></i>, for example, highlights
        with blue triangles entries that have been categorized as “Casting” by
        the Making and Knowing Project editorial team. This scatterplot shows

    <p>The clusters mentioned above, which represent together about 75% of the
        manuscript’s word length, disprove that Ms.&nbsp;Fr.&nbsp;640 is
        entirely devoid of structure. The author-practitioner, in fact, disposed
        most of these entries around specific themes.<a href="#fn23"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref23"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a> Admittedly, several entries are
        scattered for no apparent reason. Part of this fuzziness is due,
        perhaps, to the inherent difficulty for modern readers to categorize
        these entries according to criteria that would entirely match those of
        the author-practitioner.<a href="#fn24"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref24"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a> Another reason is that the
        author-practitioner’s concern for thematic coherence is likely to have
        been counterbalanced by more practical matters during the different
        stages of composition of the manuscript, such as the changing
        availability of his sources or, even more prosaically, the lack of space
        on a given folio. These scatterplots, in fact, further highlight the
        dual nature of Ms.&nbsp;Fr.&nbsp;640, both a commonplace book recording
        different techniques from different sources, and a publication in the
        making.</p>
    <p>This leads us to another important third variable one can visualize, this
        time with a bubble chart (<i><u>Fig. 6</u></i>). This variant of the
        scatterplot displays, in addition to the size of each entry, the
        proportion of marginal annotations for each entry. Marginal annotations
        concern a relatively small part of the manuscript (27% of entries). In
        some cases, entire entries (&gt;90%) are on the margin (on fols.&nbsp;<a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/24v/f/24v/tl"><u>24v</u></a>,
        <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/64r/f/64r/tl"><u>64r</u></a>,
        <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/83v/f/83v/tl"><u>83v</u></a>,
        and <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/106v/f/106v/tl"><u>106v</u></a>,
        for example). These have been added subsequently, often because of their
        thematic proximity with neighboring entries. But in most cases, bubbles
        between 25% and 80% signal the inclusion of additional instructions and
        information; details about specific procedures, instruments, methods and
        ingredients, but also feedback from previous experimentation.
        Interestingly, these mid-sized bubbles are, once again, situated for the
        most part in the last third of the manuscript. “Casting,” in fact, is
        not only the dominating topic in Ms.&nbsp;Fr.&nbsp;640, but also the one
        that attracts the greatest number of annotations, as 42% of entries
        related to this topic include marginal notes, with an average proportion
        of 25%—more than any other category. Therefore, the reason that
        “Casting” entries tend to be lengthier than other entries is, in all
        likelihood, that the author-practitioner subjected them to a more
        elaborate process of composition.</p>

    <p>Word count, position in the manuscript, frequency and proportion of
        annotations, all these variables concur in highlighting the particular
        status of casting techniques. Yet, how does “Casting” exactly compare
        with other categories?</p>
    <h2 id="seeing-voices">Seeing Voices</h2>
    <p>While scatterplots are effective in isolating specific categories, they
        do not perform as well in more comparative perspectives. Treemapping, on
        the other hand, excels at visualizing the whole text with its
        constitutive parts (<i><u>Fig. 7</u></i>). In this diagram, each
        category is represented as a rectangular surface sized proportionally to
        its respective word count. In addition to displaying the relative size
        of each category, this particular treemap also indicates their average
        length with scaled colors. In doing so, the figure gives an immediate
        glimpse of the manuscript’s themes, their proportion, and their
        respective degree of fragmentation. It reveals the important contrasts
        that separate some of these categories in one quick glance. “Printing”
        and “Arms and Armor,” for example, distinguish themselves for their
        particularly lengthy entries, which respectively average 299 and 226
        words, whereas entries related to “Medicine,” average a mere 45 words.

        text; and the categories to which entries were assigned. The heatmap
        indicates, for example, a strong correlation between the lexical fields
        of weaponry and measurements (<i><u>Fig. 8</u></i>). This lexical
        interdependence is of course to be expected, since entries devoted to

    <p>Yet, besides stating the obvious, the matrix also makes clear that
        entries categorized as “Arms and Armor” are likely to include more
        “author definitions” and more references to professions than any other
        category (<i><u>Fig. 9</u></i>).<a href="#fn26"

           id="fnref26"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a> Therefore, entries about “Arms
        and Armor” not only tend to be grouped in specific sections of the
        manuscript, as I have shown above with Fig. 4, but they also display a
        unique combination of formal and semantic characteristics, as if they
        constituted a voice of their own. Scholars have in fact noted that,
        while such entries provide a precise characterization of the weapons
        that arsenals of the time could produce, they seldom dwell on the
        details of their manufacturing process. According to Pascal Brioist,
        this probably suggests that access to the arsenal of Toulouse was denied
        to the author-practitioner.<a href="#fn27"

        descriptive than prescriptive also provides some clues as to what
        audience the author-practitioner may have been targeting. Indeed, Colin
        Debuiche and Sarah Muñoz argue that such descriptive entries would
        likely be addressed to notables from the city of Toulouse, or to
        political advisers working for the King. Quoting Philippe de Béthune,
        the first known owner of Ms.&nbsp;Fr.&nbsp;640, Debuiche suggests that
        these entries met the requirements of an audience concerned with
        developing “political prudence” with a better understanding of the
        technical and productive aspects of war and, more generally, of the
        kingdom’s economy.<a href="#fn28"

    <p>While “Arms and Armor” is characterized by an extensive nomenclature and

        which, in addition to its concision, greatly contrasts with the
        categories mentioned above. In the matrix, “Medicine” appears as a neat
        category that predictably develops the semantic fields of body parts,
        plants, and to a lesser extent, of time. More interestingly, the
        semantic field of medicine is not correlated with deletions, while its
        corresponding entries are completely devoid of marginal annotations
        (Fig. 8).<a href="#fn30"

        author-practitioner did not depart from this rule, preserving their
        transactional quality, sometimes even at the expense of
        comprehensiveness.</p>
    <p>In contrast, entries about “Casting,” as the treemap attests (Fig. 7),
        stand out for their expansiveness. The matrix indicates, moreover, that
        this category has the greatest propensity to include deletions (Fig. 9).
        Such correlation is consistent with my observations regarding
        annotations in the previous section of this essay (Fig. 6). It provides
        visual evidence that entries about casting are the result of a
        particularly wrought writing process, one that implied back and forth
        movements from the manuscript to manual activity in the workshop.
        “Casting,” in other words, may be regarded as the author-practitioner’s
        core contribution to that “commerce of letters” he evoked in his
        tentative preface; not only because of the preponderant place of the
        entries in the manuscript but also because their redaction implied a
        greater investment in the subject matter and its verbal expression.</p>
    <p>Also worthy of attention is “Varnish” which, contrary to the examples
        mentioned above, does not denote any significant correlation with other
        annotated features of the manuscript (Fig. 9). This does not mean that,
        as a category, “Varnish” is unremarkable, but rather that the selection
        of variables used for this research may not suffice to reveal—both
        quantitatively and qualitatively—its particular features, and how it
        connects with the rest of the manuscript.</p>
    <h2 id="toward-a-fusion-of-digital-horizons">Toward a Fusion of Digital
        Horizons</h2>
    <p>As I have shown in the treemap (Fig. 7) and in the logarithmic
        scatterplot (Fig. 5), “Varnish” represents a relatively small and
        dispersed category in the manuscript. As a consequence, its salient
        traits are difficult to delineate. Categories like “Varnish,” in fact,
        may very well show the limits of an approach exclusively based on the
        edition’s own curated metadata.</p>
    <p>If, as I explained in the introduction, the editorial annotation of
        digital texts presents indisputable advantages over the automated
        approach privileged by distant readers, the former still benefits from
        the latter. According to this complementary approach, the edition’s
        metadata is temporarily foregone in order to resort to a different
        dataset produced this time by Natural Language Processing algorithms.
        Although imperfect, these algorithms have the potential to annotate
        every single word in the text.<a href="#fn32"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref32"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a> As a result, one can focus on a
        wider range of linguistic patterns: trends regarding specific uses of a
        word, or of any kind of lexical fields, spellings, and parts of speech.
        <br>
        Such trends are easy to visualize on a cumulative frequency plot, as
        they are based on the same Cartesian coordinate system used in the
        scatterplots shown above. The main difference is that the
        <em>x</em>-axis does not represent the manuscript’s folios but its
        cumulative word count. The <em>y</em>-axis, on the other hand, records
        the cumulative number of occurrences in the manuscript. Cumulative
        frequency plots reflect consistent uses of words with smooth positive
        slopes—comparable to linear functions. Conversely, they can signal
        irregularities with sharp rises or sudden plateaux. Through this method,
        one can detect subtle evolutions in the way authors express themselves.
        For example, the cumulative frequencies of singular masculine and
        feminine determinate articles, <em>le</em> and <em>la</em>, signal
        diverging patterns that would have been otherwise imperceptible without
        the aid of a computer (<i><u>Fig. 10</u></i>).<a href="#fn33"

    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>The same method can also reveal abrupt and
        unexpected changes such as the irruption of alternative spellings (<i><u>Fig. 11</u></i>). The pronoun <em>ung</em> (84 occurrences), for
        example, a variant of the much more frequent <em>un</em> (1,329
        occurrences), appears sporadically in the manuscript (notably with the
        hands C and D, on fols.&nbsp;20r and <a

    <p>This would make sense, after all, as scribes presumably wrote what was
        being orally dictated to them using their own orthography, like
        <em>verny</em> instead of the prevalent <em>vernis</em>, or like the
        phonetic spelling of the Latin <em>terra merita</em> into <em>terroy
            merita</em> (hand E on fol.&nbsp;<a

           id="fnref34"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a> Yet these scribes not only used
        different orthographies and calligraphies, but sometimes also addressed
        the reader as <em>vous</em>, instead of the second-person singular
        <em>tu</em> (the dominating personal deixis with 1,250 occurrences) and
        it is unclear why, if they were merely writing down what was dictated to
        them, they would also change personal deixis.<a href="#fn35"

    <p>Perhaps more importantly, all the aforementioned anomalies intersect in a
        way that is clear and statistically significant on fols.&nbsp;73r–79v,
        and, while the entries from this particular passage belong to a wide
        variety of smaller categories, all of them seem to converge under a
        broader theme, as many <em>species</em> of the same <em>genus</em>.
        Indeed, be they categorized as “Varnish,” “Wood and its Coloring,”
        “Metal Process,” “Wax Process,” “Corrosives,” or “Painting,” these
        entries ultimately are related to the application of color to surfaces.
        They constitute a thematic cluster in its own right that my initial
        approach had not detected.</p>
    <p>In that respect, besides corroborating the idea of a thematically
        structured manuscript, this method sheds light on another factor of
        thematic coherence that may explain in part some of the stylistic and
        formal divergences between categories, namely the intervention of
        specialized contributors in the manuscript: in this case, perhaps a
        collaborator from the author-practitioner’s workshop who addressed the
        latter as <em>vous</em>, an acquaintance in the city of Toulouse who
        specialized in painting and who was invited to share some of his
        techniques for the occasion, or a particular written source read aloud
        by the author-practitioner to his amanuensis.</p>
    <p>Crucially, when used in combination, the two methods enable us to make
        the most of data-rich editions, while remaining aware of the hermeneutic
        nature of the enterprise. Indeed, like any other human endeavor, the
        digital annotations provided by the editorial team fall into an
        interpretive horizon. The automated approach I used in this part of the
        essay actually helps to refine this horizon, adapting it to specific
        research questions.</p>
    <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Ms.&nbsp;Fr.&nbsp;640 may look like a chaotic and fragmented
        <em>zibaldone</em>. However, by cross-referencing the edition’s
        semantic, structural, and formal tags, my essay shows that this
        fragmentary feel to the manuscript can be misleading. The different
        themes and styles, the diversity of spellings and personal deixes, the
        particular distribution of deletions, annotations and handwritings, all
        denote a polyphony in the text, based on a plurality of sources, be they
        written or oral. Yet the manuscript is not exactly a <em>zibaldone</em>,
        but rather a compilation of entries that gather first- and second-hand
        information, for the most part around some clear thematic clusters. This
        first attempt at organizing entries may indicate, along with the
        prologue draft, that the manuscript ultimately constitutes the basis on
        which a printed book might have emerged. Admittedly, some parts of the
        manuscript are less polished than others, sometimes to such a degree
        that one may wonder whether this compilation did not itself suffer, at
        some point, from a process of “zibaldonization,” so to speak. The fact
        that most deletions and annotations appear in the last part of the
        manuscript may reinforce this impression; as if the author-practitioner,
        caught up in the difficulties, not only of the matter at hand but also
        of its verbal expression, was progressively bogged down by it and
        eventually stumbled at the finish line. Hypotheses of that nature are
        facilitated by the holistic perspective that data visualization makes
        possible. This type of perspective, which I named here “literary
        synthesis,” is particularly useful in the study of complex manuscript
        sources like Ms.&nbsp;Fr.&nbsp;640. Contrary to literary analysis, which
        tends to rely on a patchy and fragmented approach to the text, literary
        synthesis ponders the relations that such fragments maintain with each
        other and with the document as a whole. Conventional literary analyses
        tend to overlook synthetic questions, since the global trends and
        patterns that data-driven approaches to the text reveal are often
        invisible to the naked eye. They can, admittedly, be intuited, and a
        scholar may use his or her authority to communicate this impression. Yet
        data visualization lets us engage critically with this intuition, and
        confront it with empirical evidence. It also enables us to communicate
        this perspective easily and to convey difficult notions to a wider
        audience. Such visualizations remain an interpretation of the text,
        however, as the data provided by the editors of Ms.&nbsp;Fr.&nbsp;640
        originate from a specific horizon. It is therefore important to keep
        framing such data-driven approaches as a form of computer-assisted
        hermeneutics, and not as an objective science. The dual technique I
        exposed in the final part of the essay allows us, in this sense, to
        establish a dialogue with this particular horizon in order to refine it
        according to our specific, but evolving, research questions.</p>

                    representative of the Digital Humanities as a whole is
                    admittedly questionable. Indeed, quantitative methods in

                    some quantitative approaches to literature do not share the

                    Underwood, for example, distant reading is characterized,

                <p>There is no standard approach to calculate density in a
                    digital edition. The simplest way would be to use:
                    [<em>ρ</em> = <em>m</em> / <em>v</em>], where <em>ρ</em> is
                    density, <em>m</em> the number of characters in the

                <p>A quick look at the corpora used in distant readings seems to
                    corroborate the idea according to which, the bigger the
                    corpora, the lower is their data density. This correlation
                    is not only the result of limited resources (annotating
                    manually thousands of texts comes with a steep price), but
                    also that of an enduring idealistic bias in the digital
                    humanities that perceives digitization as a sort of
                    “extraction,” a liberation of the text from its material
                    limitations. In countries like France, for example, the term
                    “digitization” is still often conflated with that of
                    “dematerialization.” In other cases, digitization is seen as
                    a form of “transmedialization,” that is to say an
                    abstraction not only from the material medium but also from

                <p>According to Carlo Vecce, Leonardo’s manuscripts denote a
                    keen interest in the poetry of Dante and Petrarch, in the
                    novels of Masuccio Salernitano, Luigi Pulci, and Boccaccio,
                    and perhaps more importantly in the vernacular works of
                    humanist Cristoforo Landino, who translated among other
                    books, Pliny the Elder in Florentine. See Carlo Vecce,

                <p>Coefficients have been calculated using both the 𝜙𝐾 (Fig.
                    8) and the point-biserial methods (Fig. 9). The latter is
                    more accurate with correlations between Categories and
                    Markup (bottom-left and top right squares). Correlations
                    need to be carefully interpreted and should be used for
                    exploratory purposes only. Correlations between tags and
                    categories, moreover, are based on absolute values. For
                    maximal accuracy, it is recommended to calculate relative
