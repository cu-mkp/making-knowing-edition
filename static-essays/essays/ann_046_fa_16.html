        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <div>
            <p>What is bread in the context of Ms. Fr. 640? This category of
                food appears in the manuscript under three different names:
                bread, host (<a
                   href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/37r/f/37r/tl"><u>37r</u></a>),
                and toast (<a
                   href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/79v/f/79v/tl"><u>79v</u></a>,
                <a
                   href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/123v/f/123v/tl"><u>123v</u></a>).
                The meaning and use of these terms are considered as well as the
                production of bread and Hosts in the early modern period and the
                pathways by which bread could have entered the
                author-practitioner’s workshop. Flour was the key factor in
                bread production, often selected by availability, preference,
                and beliefs about particular cereals. The baking practices
                required for different grains influenced the breads one could
                bake. Some, such as oatbread, could be baked on the hearth at
                home; others, such as fine wheat bread, required the high and
                constant heat of a specialized oven and were chiefly baked
                professionally. The varieties of flours, breads, and processes
                show the meaning of “bread” in the period of the manuscript’s
                compilation cannot be taken for granted.</p>

    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>Table 1 enables us to see the three
        principal terms used to refer to bread: <em>pain</em>, <em>rostie</em>,
        and <em>ostie</em>. While the first is simply the generic noun “bread,”
        the other two imply a specific kind of bread, with <em>rostie</em>
        referring to toast and <em>ostie</em> to the Eucharist of Christian
        Communion. Table 1 also allows us to see the use of bread in utilitarian
        and creative contexts, such as feeding birds and training horses, or
        cleaning printing plates and erasing graphite and ink. Looking closely
        at bread’s presence in the manuscript also results in a surprising
        outcome. Short references to specific flours and consistencies begin to
        complicate the generic term “bread” and raise the deceptively simple
        question: what is bread? By examining a variety of agricultural,
        medical, and culinary sources, this essay seeks to answer this question
        and to explore what role bread played in an artisan’s workshop in late
        sixteenth-century Toulouse.</p>
    <p>Bread is a baked mixture of flour and water, often with yeast and salt
        added. Already, this rudimentary definition points out the main variable
        in the recipe: the flour. Far from being solely dictated by
        availability, the choice of flour depended as much on personal
        preference—often defined by class norms—as on beliefs and
        characteristics attributed to different varieties of cereal.<a

    <h2 id="bread-in-the-urban-realm">Bread in the Urban Realm</h2>
    <p>Let us turn our attention to the production of bread in early modern
        Europe. From the multitude of bread varieties available, it is clear
        that social status played an important role in bread production and
        consumption, since specialty ovens and the fuel required to heat them
        made some breads less accessible. For example, <em>manchet</em>, a bread
        made of the finest white flour and favored by the wealthy in England
        between 1550 and 1600, required a purpose-built oven that ensured the
        bricks were evenly heated at a consistent, high temperature.<a

    <p>But even for the lower social classes, bread was not only a matter of
        cost but also of preference. In Juan Luis Vives’s <em>Dialogues</em>, a
        set of Latin translation exercises for Vives’s students in Bruges dating
        to before 1540, a conversation between a group of men highlights
        different tastes for varying amounts of yeast and water and degrees of
        sponginess and kneading.<a href="#fn29"

        host that when receiving dinner guests, his wife should purchase ten
        dozen loaves from the baker, some “day-old, flat, one-penny bread, and
        three dozen four-day-old brown trencher breads.”<a href="#fn40"

    <p>Though the production of Hosts was tightly controlled, there are
        surviving accounts of them being stolen and used outside the realm of
        the Church. The possibility of “contraband” Hosts making their way into
        secular spaces such as an artisan’s workshop cannot be excluded and
        could explain the use of the word <em>ostie</em> in the manuscript.
        However, an incident that occurred in Normandy in 1627, in which a young
        shepherd was executed after having kept the consecrated Eucharist in his
        mouth rather than swallowing it, thereby taking it out of the church,
        makes clear that the Host and its whereabouts were not taken lightly.<a

        whether the term <em>ostie</em> carried religious significance,
        especially as it appears with wine. This recipe can be compared with
        another medical recipe on fol. <a

           id="fnref84"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>84</sup></a> Nevertheless, we should not
        exclude the possibility that <em>ostie</em> is used not to designate a

        of flour and water, a mixture that the word Host conveys. Knowing the
        religious affinity of the author-practitioner would be of use in
        speculating about the likelihood that he would use a word designating
        the all-important Catholic sacrament to colloquially refer to a sort of
        cracker.</p>
    <p>The orthographic similarity of <em>ostie</em> and <em>rostie</em> and the
        fact that each only appears in the manuscript once (in preventive and
        curative functions) raises the question of whether they might refer to
        the same thing, namely a sort of cracker or toast. Is the “r” in
        <em>rostie</em> a slip of the pen, or, conversely, is <em>ostie</em>
        missing its first letter? Jean Nicot’s <em>Thresor de la Langue
            Française</em> from 1606 defines <em>rostie</em> simply as
        “<em>panis tostus</em>,” or toasted bread.<a href="#fn86"

        The shared medical context perhaps supports thinking of the latter as a
        misspelling of the former. A cursory search for “<em>ostie</em>” on
        Gallica failed to identify other instances of the word being used within
        the domestic and medical realm. Further research on the use of the word
        <em>ostie</em> in secular contexts would therefore be useful.</p>
    <h2 id="bread-in-the-workshop">Bread in the Workshop</h2>
    <p>By way of conclusion, and with this rich historical web of bread in mind,
        we can now turn to the question of how bread entered the workshop of the
        author-practitioner. The prominence of bakers’ guilds in France in the
        period makes the bakery a likely source for the bread used in the
        manuscript’s recipes. However, as has been argued above, we must not
        dismiss domestic baking practices, tasks that predominantly fell to the
        wife of the household. The common practice of dispensing bread as
        payment in kind to workshop employees might also support a domestic
        provenance.<a href="#fn87"

           id="fnref87"

        taken out, an indication of the temperature desired for these tasks,
        suggests the possibility of baking bread in the workshop. Additionally,
        the resemblance in visual sources between bakers’ ovens (<i><u>Fig. 3</u></i>) and metalworkers’ ovens (<i><u>Fig. 4</u></i>)
        supports this possibility.<a href="#fn90"

    <p>What this preliminary study of the world of baking in early modern
        Toulouse has demonstrated is the pervasive and diverse presence of
        bread.<a href="#fn92"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref92"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>92</sup></a> In the manuscript, concise and
        scattered allusions to bread support an understanding of this material
        as something both ubiquitous and highly particular. The category of
        “bread” is characterized by diversity, from fine wheaten loaves baked in
        specialized ovens and rustic oat breads cooked before the fire to
        amalgams of various pulses and unrefined cereal flours consolidated into
        a dense dough. Although the author-practitioner does not elaborate on
        his particular understanding of bread, occasional references to specific
        flours demonstrate his awareness of their different properties. This
        merits further research to elucidate the context of bread in Toulouse.
        Nevertheless, this introductory study helps us imagine the context for
        the author-practitioner’s use of bread in his workshop.</p>

                    This belief was carried over in the early modern period, as
                    made clear by the English Elizabethan physician and
                    naturalist Thomas Moffet’s claim that “Bread doth of all
                    things best nourish and strengthen… with a little Bread they
                    are enabled for a whole dayes journey, when with twice as

                <p>While Galen claimed that “whatever is completely without
                    yeast is of use to no one,” he did find benefits to
                    yeast-less wheat wafers, which, although they could
                    “obstruct the... liver,” cause “a weak spleen,” and
                    “[produce] stones in the kidneys,” they were nonetheless
                    “slow to pass” and “reasonably nourishing, if … converted
                    into blood properly.” Indeed, Galen believed bread made
                    “strong firm flesh,” and emphasized the relationship between
                    the “finest bread” and the “best blood.” According to the
                    Galenic theory of concoction, food in the stomach was
                    transformed into chyle, which the liver converted to the
                    four humors, which then nourished the rest of the body,
                    replenishing the flesh and organs. Consequently, excessive
                    eating could lead to bad humors resulting in corporeal
                    deterioration. See Grant, <em>Galen on Food and Diet</em>,

                    manuscript as well as on oven technology in the early modern
                    period. This essay could not address the numerous mentions
                    of specific flours (43 references to wheat, 2 to rye, 9 to
                    millet, and 1 each to oat and barley) in the manuscript,
                    which merit a closer look. The frequency of references to
                    wheat support my hypothesis that the bread used in the
                    manuscript is wheat bread. Additionally, the fact that the
                    second most commonly named grain is millet is not
                    coincidental, given the presence of a recipe for
                    <em>millas</em> in the manuscript and the popularity of such
                    millet bread in Toulouse. For more information on
                    <em>millas</em>, see Chiostrini and Palframan, “Making
                    Millet Bread,” <a
