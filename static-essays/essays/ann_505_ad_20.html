        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <div>
            <p>Ms. Fr. 640 contains several entries for making metals “run.”
                Fluidly running metals are essential in casting. These entries,
                including “Making gold run for casting” on fol. <a
                   href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/106r/f/106r/tl"><u>106r</u></a>,
                are among the most carefully observed and most laboriously
                written sections in Ms. Fr. 640. Like lifecasting and gem making
                entries in other parts of the manuscript, they appear to have
                been at the heart of the author-practitioner’s interests and his
                firsthand experimentation.</p>

    <h2 id="making-metals-run">Making Metals Run</h2>
    <p>Ms. Fr. 640, fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/106r/f/106r/tl"><u>106r</u></a>,
        contains an entry for “Making gold run for casting,” which describes how
        to make and employ a substance that the author-practitioner says will
        maintain the heat of gold during casting so that the gold will run
        fluidly into all parts of a mold and the cast will “come out neatly.”
        This is especially important to the author-practitioner because he sees
        pure gold as very “dry” (<em>sec</em>): “When gold is very fine, it is
        so dry that it can hardly endure a hammer [i.e., it is very brittle and
        will crack on being hammered], but this mixture softens
        [<em>adoulcist</em>] it like lead.” Today we would call this substance a
        flux, which we see as cleaning the surface of the metal from oxides and
        causing it to run more fluidly through the mold, as defined in a
        twentieth-century manual:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>A flux is a substance applied to the surface of molten metal
            primarily to prevent oxygen in the air from coming in contact with
            the hot metal, to cause oxidation. In addition, the flux dissolves
            oxides, which may form while the metal is being heated […]. A flux
            in powder form is normally used for metals during the melting for a
            casting operation […]. The powder fluxes may contain finely divided
            charcoal or other ingredients mixed with borax and boric acid to
            give added protection by producing what is described as a reducing
            flux. The presence of the charcoal not only helps to prevent the
            formation of oxides on the metal surface, but also tends to reduce
            to free metal any oxides that may have been formed. Fluxes in powder
            form may contain also a very small percentage (1 to 2%) of finely
            divided silica flour which aids in holding the molten flux in
            position on the surface of the hot metal.<a href="#fn1"

               id="fnref1"
               role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>The author-practitioner conceived of his
        substance to make gold run as cleaning, or “clarifying” the gold, but he
        saw the more important function of the substance as heating and
        softening (or, literally, “sweetening”) the metal. This comes through
        clearly in the entry on fol. 106r because this recipe appears to reflect
        two campaigns of writing by the author-practitioner: He first titled the
        recipe simply “Gold,” and it dealt with how to remedy gold’s
        characteristic of cooling down too quickly (making it unable to fill all
        parts of a mold). While a mixture he calls “sublimate” works well to
        make gold run, it goes up in smoke, so he gives an alternative substance
        that keeps gold warm. It contains sal ammoniac (ammonium chloride),
        verdet (verdigris), borax, and saltpeter (potassium nitrate):</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Gold</p>
        <p>Because gold cools down very quickly, one ought to give it a mixture
            when <del>melted <em>q</em></del> it is well melted which maintains
            the heat. Sublimate softens it nicely. But, because it goes up in
            smoke, it does not continue to help. Therefore, mix this composition
            when you want to cast: sal ammoniac, the best verdet that you can
            find, a little borax &amp; saltpeter <em>
                <del><sup>qui li</sup></del>
            </em>. And this, by keeping it warm, it will come out neatly.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>Then, in a different ink, and probably at
        a later time, the author-practitioner added further information to the
        title to make it more specific, “<strong><sup>Making</sup> gold <sup>run
                for casting</sup></strong>,” and, apparently at the same time,
        provided key information about the effects of the ingredients—noting
        that saltpeter clarifies and heats the molten gold, and commenting that
        the verdigris is the most important part of the recipe, with the result
        that gold runs “like lead”:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Saltpeter clarifies it &amp; <em>
                <del>p</del>
            </em> heats it. But the most important thing in this mixture is the
            verdet, which has to be good. This mixture softens the gold <em>
                <del>qui</del>
            </em> so much that it becomes treatable like lead, even fine gold,”
        </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>In the margin, he then summed up the
        effect that the substance will have on gold: “When gold is very fine
        [<em>fort fin</em>], it is so dry [<em>sec</em>] that it can hardly
        endure a hammer, but this mixture softens [<em>ladoulcist</em>] it like
        lead.” He returns to emphasize this information about gold in its purest
        state in “Fine gold,” on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/124v/f/124v/tl"><u>124v</u></a>:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>There is a property of gold which, even though it is very fine &amp;
            unalloyed &amp; has been passed through aquafortis &amp; antimony,
            is nevertheless so brittle that it hardly withstands the hammer. And
            the composition of verdet, described above to make gold run, makes
            it as soft as lead.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <h2 id="writing-observing-experimenting">Writing, Observing, Experimenting
    </h2>
    <p>The author-practitioner’s intensive engagement with this recipe,
        indicated by his successive writing campaigns during which he added
        further information after what may have been his firsthand trials with
        the process, can be found in several other recipes that involve making
        metals “run,” including gold, silver, copper, latten, and tin. Indeed,
        the entries on making silver run on fols. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/120v/f/120v/tl"><u>120v</u></a>

        as well as the additional entries for making gold run on fols. <a

        are some of the most closely observed and laboriously described accounts
        of processes in the entire manuscript, surpassed perhaps only by the
        lifecasting entries. These entries take up entire folios, and the
        numerous deletions and interlinear additions of further observations
        make it clear that the author-practitioner labored over describing the
        process. Moreover, the language in many of them indicates that he
        returned to them after firsthand trial.</p>
    <p>Among the recipes for making metals run, fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/123r/f/123r/tl"><u>123r</u></a>–<a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/123v/f/123v/tl"><u>v</u></a>
        is a particularly comprehensive example. It lists the ingredients in
        classic recipe fashion, with measurements for each substance, careful
        step-by-step procedures, including even the necessary ingredients for
        luting the flask (i.e., coating it with earth to protect it from
        breakage) in which the substance will be heated, as well as timing for
        the entire process. This entry also includes information about the
        hazards of the substances, including a means to protect oneself from
        this dangerous substance:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Make each time a good quantity of this substance, so as not to do it
            often, because the fumes, which are dangerous, could hurt you. And
            before working at it, take in the morning good buttered toast, and
            hold the said butter, or zedoary, or gold coins, in your mouth, and
            <em>
                <del>ada</del>
            </em> cover your face with a cloth from the eyes down.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>He even suggests an alternative to these
        personal protective measures: “Or else [...] have had your drugs pestled
        by some rustic,” and “have the fire managed by a shop boy familiar with
        charcoal.”</p>
    <p>Unusually in Ms. Fr. 640, the author-practitioner exhibits an attempt at
        secrecy in this carefully described recipe on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/123r/f/123r/tl"><u>123r</u></a>–<a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/123v/f/123v/tl"><u>v</u></a>:
        he writes the title as, “A means <em>di far correr lotnegra</em>”
        (<em>Moyen di far correr lotnegra</em>), including a phrase in Italian,
        “<em>di far correr lotnetgra</em>,” with “silver” (<em>argento</em>)
        written backwards, which all translates as “A means to make silver run.”
        This rather transparent code is found only a couple of times in the
        manuscript. This entry is also unusual because, just as the
        author-practitioner does not usually specify that processes should be
        kept secret, he also does not frequently mention financial aspects of
        processes, yet he does both in this recipe for the substance to make
        silver run:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Goldsmiths who have knowledge of this substance sell a
            <em>denier</em> of it for 5 sous to other goldsmiths, &amp;
            especially to those who work in plate and large wares, for at the
            end of their works, they can solder over the first solder by means
            of this mixture [...]. This material should not be divulged, lest it
            be abused.”</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>On fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/121v/f/121v/tl"><u>121v</u></a>,
        in another entry on “Silver for casting,” he mentions again that “If the
        goldsmiths knew the substance to make silver run in their works, they
        would buy much of it. Some buy it five sous for a <em>denier</em>.” The
        repeated interest in the commercial potential of a material is missing
        from much of the rest of the manuscript.</p>
    <p>Another recipe for making metals run, “Casting with gold and silver,” on
        fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/128r/f/128r/tl"><u>128r</u></a>–<a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/128v/f/128v/tl"><u>v</u></a>,
        is similarly detailed, laboriously recorded, and refers back to the
        recipe for “making silver run” on fol. 123r–v. Another long and detailed
        entry follows immediately after “Casting with gold and silver” on fol.
        128v for “Whitening of cast silver.” This fascinating entry describes in
        great detail the procedure of “an excellent German” in lifecasting a
        lizard, and his secret for whitening silver. In both these
        densely-written, very long entries that flow over multiple folios, there
        appears to be a combination of both firsthand experimentation and his
        recording of practices he has witnessed. On fol. 128v, a marginal notes
        admonishes, “do not let yourself forget to put, before all things, a
        little borax in the melted silver, for even though goldsmiths do not put
        any in, nevertheless it is good, and I have seen it practiced well.”</p>
    <p>The laboriousness of the author-practitioner’s efforts in setting down in
        writing these processes for making precious metals run, and the mix of
        language contained in them indicating both firsthand and observed
        experience, make it difficult to know whether the author-practitioner is
        speaking as a goldsmith—these substances are certainly of prime interest
        to a goldsmith—or as an interested observer. These recipes certainly
        give the impression of expert, professional, and even commercial
        interest in this area. The author-practitioner’s expertise in other
        knowledge domains of goldsmithing is also demonstrated in his casting
        and gem-making recipes.<a href="#fn2"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref2"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
    <p>Whatever the case of his expertise may be, the author-practitioner is
        quite consistent in the substance that he recommends for making gold
        run. Besides the entry on fol. 106r, there are two other recipes, on
        fols. 120r and 134v, that refer specifically to a mixture of borax, sal
        ammoniac, saltpeter and verdigris to heat gold and keep it hot while
        casting. On fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/120r/f/120r/tl"><u>120r</u></a>—another
        densely worked-over page—he includes specific information about German
        practices in the margins, and mentions, like on fol. 106r, that
        sublimate heats and cleans “gold because by its exhalations, it draws
        everything out as it goes up in smoke,” but only the verdigris mixture
        conserves its heat and “makes it run”:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Sand for casting in gold</p>
        <p>You could cast gold well in common sand of goldsmiths, should you
            throw therein some substance that makes it run. Before the invention
            of <em>crocum</em>, one would cast flowers in silver but not at all
            in gold. It has not been forty years that one knows this in Germany.
        </p>
        <p>***</p>
        <p>Sublimate is commonly employed by goldsmiths for gold. Some add
            sulfur, but they &amp; others are wrong, for sulfur sours, even as
            it heats. And the sublimate is agitated, boils, and bubbles. It is
            very good to clean gold because by its exhalations, it draws
            everything out as it goes up in smoke. But to warm gold &amp;
            conserve its heat, there is only the <em>couleur</em>, which is
            verdet, sal ammoniac, saltpeter &amp; borax. This makes it run,
            &amp; you can throw in a branch of wormseed.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>One wonders how he knows this particular
        detail about substances used by Germans.<a href="#fn3"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref3"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
    <p>On fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/134v/f/134v/tl"><u>134v</u></a>,
        in the entry “For making ☀ [gold] run,” the author-practitioner provides
        more specific information about the amounts of these ingredients that
        should be used:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Verdigris &amp; sal ammoniac, as much of one as the other, borax
            &amp; saltpeter, as much of one as the other. But the <em>
                <del>s</del>
            </em> borax &amp; <em>
                <del>sel armo</del>
            </em> saltpeter together must only weigh half of the others, that is
            to say, as much together as the verdigris. Grind them finely into
            powder on marble, then grind them again with some good strong
            vinegar until it is fine, like a <em>couleur</em> and verdet ground
            in oil. Next, leave it to dry on its own, if you have time, or in
            the fire <em>
                <del>lent</del>
            </em> of the forge, &amp; make sure it is well dry.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Our cursory search for similar recipes in contemporary sources showed
        that goldsmiths had used fluxes<a href="#fn4"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref4"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> for centuries: Benvenuto Cellini
        mentions adding charcoal to lead, silver, and copper when making niello
        to purify the mixture.<a href="#fn5"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref5"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> He also mentions using a
        combination of borax and verdigris for soldering silver. Borax is
        mentioned by several makers during the early modern period (including
        the author-practitioner of Ms. Fr. 640), as are sal ammoniac and
        saltpeter,<a href="#fn6"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref6"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> but our preliminary research did
        not turn up any other sources that mentioned using all four materials
        mixed together. Much more research is necessary, however, to determine
        this point with any certainty.</p>

        “efflorescence” appeared on the copper after about twelve days (<i><u>Fig. 2</u></i>), and we harvested the verdigris after thirty-five
        days (<i><u>Fig. 3</u></i>). It fell cleanly off in a powder when we
        simply bent the sheets (<i><u>Fig. 4</u></i>). Three sheets of
        approximately 6x8 inches and one sheet of approximately 8x14 inches
        yielded about 8 ml (by volume) of verdigris powder (<i><u>Fig. 5</u></i>), which we then ground in a mortar and pestle to ensure there were no
        larger clumps (<i><u>Fig. 6</u></i>).</p>

    <h3 id="process">Process</h3>
    <p>To make the substance, we combined a ½ teaspoon of verdigris with a ¼
        teaspoon of borax, saltpeter, and sal ammoniac, respectively (<i><u>Fig. 7</u></i>).<a href="#fn9"

        because no detail was given in the recipe except “a little borax &amp;
        saltpeter,” and, at the time of reconstructing this process, we had not
        noticed the instructions of ratios on fol. 134v. We chose to add more
        verdigris than the other ingredients because the recipe specifically
        states that, “the most important thing in this mixture is the verdet,
        which has to be good.”</p>

    <p>Because the mixture is said to soften “the gold so much that it becomes
        treatable like lead, even fine gold,” we used 22 carat gold.<a
           href="#fn10"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref10"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> In our understanding, gold that
        is purer has a higher melting point, but, for the author-practitioner,
        pure gold was “dry,” thus making it hard to melt until it was made soft
        and sweet.<a href="#fn11"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref11"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
    <p>We used a propane torch to heat gold in a ceramic crucible.<a
           href="#fn12"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref12"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> As the pieces of gold began
        melting, they drew together into a molten globule. However, this globule
        was somewhat flat and oxides were visible on its surface, giving it a
        soiled appearance. Once our expert maker, Dr. Boyd, felt that the gold
        and the crucible were hot enough, we added our verdigris mixture, with a
        dramatic result: the flame around the crucible flashed greenish yellow,
        and a pungent, acidic odor arose from the crucible. The substance
        appeared momentarily to sizzle on the surface of the gold and the
        crucible, and then the oxide on the surface of the gold disappeared, and
        the gold drew together into more of a round shape.</p>
    <p>In order to test how well the metal flowed, we molded two different
        shapes: a small cross shape with bulbous ends through which the metal
        could flow easily, and a large unembellished ring that we thought would
        prove more challenging for the flow. The addition of the verdigris
        substance did visibly “clarify” the gold, and the pour into our first
        mold, the small cross, worked perfectly on the first try (<i><u>Fig. 8</u></i>). Our second mold, the ring, took three tries for the
        gold to flow completely through it, but eventually we were also able to
        get a successful cast of the shape (<i><u>Fig. 9</u></i>).<a

        the efficacy of this substance, it performed so similarly to the flux in
        use by the dental office of our expert maker that Dr. Boyd jokingly
        asked if it were available for purchase. According to him, “it worked
        exactly the same” as his usual flux, presumably aside from the flash of
        green and the acidic smell.</p>

                <p>The gold we used was melted down from discarded crowns and
                    inlays, and Dr. Boyd (a dental surgeon) estimated that it
                    was probably about 22 carat gold, although it was impossible
                    to know for sure, as this was gold scrap, rather than gold
                    obtained from a single known source. We were fortunate in
                    having access to gold and a gold casting facility, and Dr.
                    Boyd, an expert caster. While it may seem unusual to refer
                    to a dentist as an expert maker of cast gold objects, in
                    fact Dr. Boyd has been using modern techniques to cast gold
                    crowns, fillings, inlays, and onlays for teeth for 50 years.
                    Although today it is most common for dentists to outsource
                    this type of laboratory work, Drs. Boyd, PC, is one of a
                    handful of offices in New York City where the doctors do
                    their own work in gold in order to ensure quality.<a
