        <div>
            <p>This essay describes the Making and Knowing Project’s creation of
                the Digital Critical Edition of Ms. Fr. 640 through
                interdisciplinary pedagogy and research. It elaborates the
                various components of the Project, including Text Workshops,
                Laboratory and Digital Seminars, institutional collaborations,
                and digital design and development. The potentials and pitfalls
                of the method of historical reconstruction in a laboratory are
                discussed, and an introductory survey of insights gained through
                the student research in texts, objects, and hands-on laboratory
                work is provided.</p>

    <p>This digital critical Edition and English translation of the French
        manuscript, Ms. Fr. 640, held by the Bibliothèque nationale de France
        (BnF), presents this rich and unique sixteenth-century technical text in
        French transcription and English translation for the first time, and
        situates its contents in their material and historical context. The
        Edition not only presents traditional archival and paleographic research
        on the manuscript, but also material reconstructions and analyses of the
        techniques described in it, through the student essays and their field
        notes. Thus, it allows users to both read the manuscript and experience
        it as a record of material practices.</p>
    <p>The digital edition of Ms. Fr. 640 makes two important contributions to a
        broad, interdisciplinary scholarly community made up of historians of
        craft, art, science, material culture, recipes, and daily life, as well
        as museum conservators, scholars of the digital humanities, and an even
        broader audience of history students, makers, artists, re-enactors, and
        individuals curious about materials and techniques of the past. First,
        the Edition makes accessible a rich source of information about craft,
        art, and technical procedures and materials in premodern Europe. It
        significantly enhances the existing body of early modern technical
        writing. Second, as the Project’s initial research and dissemination
        through courses, meetings, and multiple minimal editions has already
        shown, it engages readers, whether researchers, students, or the broader
        public, in a new approach to exploring historical texts, one that
        emphasizes the importance of the material conditions, interpretations,
        and outcomes that emerge when the written word is realized through
        making and practice. The manuscript codifies procedures that were not
        meant to be reproduced solely through the act of reading but are,
        rather, an invitation to imitate and experiment. Thus, the Edition,
        through its critical commentary and accompanying resources, invites its
        audience to read and analyze the text, but also to explore and
        investigate the materials and processes detailed within it.</p>
    <p>A “critical edition” is a scholarly format formalized in the nineteenth
        century to create a definitive version of a manuscript or manuscript
        corpus. The present Edition provides an accurate transcription of the
        manuscript’s middle French text, a lightly-normalized modernized French
        version, and a literal English translation that provides the clearest
        interpretation of the text possible, given its contents of often
        obscure, long forgotten, and incompletely- or confusingly-described
        technical processes. A List of Entries provides a searchable and
        filterable index of the almost 930 headings in the manuscript with lists
        of encoded terms contained in each entry. The accompanying Research
        Essays and the editorial comments inserted throughout the text of the
        Edition provide analysis and interpretation of the contents of the
        manuscript. The scholarly apparatus of the Edition also includes a
        glossary of technical terms used in the manuscript that was compiled in
        the course of the Text Workshops, a list of dictionaries and technical
        encyclopedias used in the Workshops, and the principles of
        transcription, translation, and encoding followed in the Workshops. The
        digital format of the Edition has allowed inclusion of multiple media
        formats and a dynamic design that goes beyond the features possible in a
        convention print edition.</p>
    <p>The Project’s effort to produce this definitive <em>product</em>, an
        edition of Ms. Fr. 640, exists in tension with one of the greatest
        potentials of the digital humanities: user-directed, open-ended
        interactivity that allows scholarship to be built upon, broken down,
        with data, platform, and methods reused and reassembled by reader-users
        in new and inventive ways. A recognition of the tension between the
        Project’s aim of a definitive critical edition <em>product</em> and the
        digital humanities <em>process</em> we employed came to a head as we
        sought to produce the Edition through graduate and undergraduate
        workshops and courses, which necessitated working within the parameters
        of single-semester courses (although we extended this timeframe by two
        to three weeks, generally teaching for 16 weeks and editing the essays
        for several more). More significant, however, was our increasing
        immersion in the “recipes” and processes of Ms. Fr. 640 as the
        laboratory seminar students sought to re-make or reconstruct them. We
        quickly came to see that a text that describes and prescribes material
        processes is by its very nature not a definitive <em>text</em>—its
        processes can never be realized in writing, and they are often much
        harder to comprehend in words than by doing (or by observing, as YouTube
        has demonstrated). A text is not a particularly good teacher of
        techniques. Transmission of technique is much more effectively
        accomplished by watching and following the lead of an experienced
        practitioner. The analysis and interpretation of Ms. Fr. 640
        necessitates extension into material and physical space. As the
        author-practitioner of Ms. Fr. 640 himself appears to have believed,
        knowledge is best transmitted by long accumulation and transmission from
        master to apprentice, and he emphasizes the need “to learn from those
        who preceded you in order to teach to those who come after” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/166r/f/166r/tl"><u>166r</u></a>).
    </p>
    <p>Moreover, Ms. Fr. 640 is a compiled text, and it can be broken down and
        rearranged in any number of ways (as the author-practitioner must surely
        have planned to do if he meant to publish it). It is thus an ideal text
        for the reassemblage and reuse that its digital format makes possible.
        The Project expects that its own repurposing of the manuscript as “data”
        will in turn come to engender many different uses, and will lead to new
        interpretations of the text, thus expanding the scope of a “critical
        edition.” This flexibility and extensibility is in fact characteristic
        of both recipe collections and digital texts.</p>
    <h2 id="making-the-edition-1">Making the Edition</h2>
    <p>The Making and Knowing Project created the Edition through a series of
        collaborative workshops, courses, and conferences that have involved
        students, craft practitioners, artists, scholars of the humanities and
        social sciences, natural and computer scientists, and
        practitioner-scholars from the emerging field of the digital
        humanities.<a href="#fn1"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref1"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> Our approach combined a
        collaborative and iterative research process with a strong pedagogical
        commitment. In its essence, however, the Making and Knowing Project is
        an experiment in intensive collaboration, grad- and crowd-sourcing, the
        integration of pedagogy and original research, the intertwining of
        matter and texts, and sheer extemporizing and improvisation. Since the
        Project’s inception in June 2014, hundreds of scholars and students have
        now used Ms. Fr. 640 in their research and teaching. Although an obscure
        and anonymous text, it has already proven to be an important source of
        evidence across a number of disciplines. But the Project’s success in
        gathering together over 400 collaborators is due primarily to the
        intriguing text and the anonymous author-practitioner at its center.
        More information about the text and the possible identity of its
        author-practitioner can be found in the essays by Pamela Smith (“An
        Introduction to BnF Ms. Fr. 640”), Marc Smith (“Making Ms. Fr. 640”),
        Colin Debuiche, and Sarah Muñoz (“Le contexte toulousaine”).<a

    <h2 id="text-workshops">Text Workshops</h2>
    <p>The first stage of transcription and translation of the manuscript was
        carried out in a series of three-week paleography workshops that brought
        together graduate students (already in possession of advanced French) to
        learn to read middle French script by transcription exercises and then
        by intensive transcription and translation of Ms. Fr. 640 (<i><u>Fig. 1</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 2</u></i>). Led by the Project’s
        Paleography Lead, Marc Smith, Professor of Latin Paleography at the
        École nationale des chartes in Paris (<i><u>Fig. 3</u></i>), and Pamela
        Smith, Director of the Making and Knowing Project, this phase received
        essential support from Claire Sabel in the first summer (2014), and from
        successive Making and Knowing postdoctoral scholars and project
        assistants, as well as Terry Catapano, the Project’s Digital Lead, and
        Alex Gil, Digital Scholarship Coordinator, Humanities and History
        Division, Columbia University Libraries. In 2014, Claire Sabel prepared
        the basic structure of the Project’s Google Drive, uploaded the
        digitized black-and-white microfilm copy of Ms. Fr. 640 (at that point,
        the only copy available from the BnF), and matched those pages in Google
        documents with the partial transcription and translation that had been
        commissioned by Pamela Smith from freelance translators Katia Scifo and
        Alice Bleuzen in segments over the previous several years. Each page of
        the manuscript was placed in a Google folder with files for each of the
        four versions of the manuscript that are now available for side-by-side
        viewing in the Edition’s panes: manuscript page facsimile, diplomatic
        transcription, normalized French transcription, and English translation.
        We chose to work in Google Drive despite its proprietary nature (and the
        fact that it was, in 2014, unfamiliar to almost all our students)
        because it was the only platform at that time which enabled apparently
        simultaneous work on the same document. Google also provided a comment
        function, something other collaborative platforms did not offer until
        more recently, and this proved essential for our workflow because
        successive cohorts of paleographers could leave information for the next
        summer’s campaign.<a href="#fn3"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref3"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> Our concern about the proprietary
        nature of Google Drive remained, however, and in 2017 the Project
        shifted its workflow entirely to Github.</p>

    <p>Beyond translating and transcribing, students also encoded the text
        according to basic Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) guidelines (with an ad
        hoc and frequently revised tag set adapted to the manuscript). From 2014
        to 2019, seven such Text Workshops as well as a full translation
        read-through were held, and they were a learning process for all
        participants (<i><u>Fig. 4</u></i>): protocols for the processes of
        collective transcription, translation, and encoding had to be devised
        (and developed and revised from year to year). Our set of markup tags
        was discussed and revised every summer until 2017, which meant many
        repeated campaigns of encoding. All versions of the text have been
        encoded with both structural and semantic tags, which provide for
        another layer of analysis, both by the Project Team and by future users
        of the Edition. The semantic tags used indicate the Project’s interest
        in craft and material knowledge, as well as the manuscript’s historical
        context, and the knowledge base of the author-practitioner. With regard
        to craft knowledge, the Project chose to tag materials, tools,
        measurements, temporal expressions, plants, animals, body parts, sensory
        expressions, and environments. In terms of the historical context, the
        Project tagged words or phrases related to music, to medicine and
        health, to arms and armor, as well as trades and professions, coins,
        personal names (including the many authors listed in the first pages),
        languages and dialects (including Occitan, Poitevin, Latin, Greek,
        German, Italian), and place names. All these categories give insight
        into the author-practitioner’s identity and knowledge base, but we also
        tagged “author definitions,” that is, when the author-practitioner
        defines or explains a term (often a clarification about a material).<a

           class="footnote-ref"

        first instance in the Markup View of the Edition (indicated by the
        &lt;/&gt; icon), and, more usefully, in the List of Entries on the menu
        bar (<a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/entries"><u>https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/entries</u></a>).
        We hope these tags will make possible computational analysis and
        interpretation of the manuscript in ways the Project has not imagined.

    <p>By 2016, we had a returning core group of students who had attended the
        Text Workshop every year and became instrumental in mentoring the
        novices and in thinking through best practices for efficient translation
        and transcription (<i><u>Fig. 5</u></i>). These dedicated participants
        included Heather Wacha, Soersha Dyon, Gregory Champeaud, José Beltrán,
        and François V. Pageau. We were joined every summer by students who
        assisted with digital tasks, directed by Terry Catapano (see <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/content/about/credits"><u>https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/content/about/credits</u></a>).
        From 2017 on, with the transcription of the manuscript complete, the
        focus of the Workshops shifted to translation and encoding. As described
        by Heather Wacha and Soersha Dyon in their essay in this Edition,
        “Turning Turtle: The Process of Translating BnF Ms. Fr. 640,” the
        interpretation and translation of the text went on even as the final
        touches were being put on the Edition. The collaborative nature of the
        translation process facilitated unexpected insights into the
        interpretation of the manuscript: the many perspectives and different
        expertises of the Workshop participants made the translation process a
        fascinating and rich journey, but it also led to inconsistency of
        language usage. Similarly, while digital tools allowed searching for all
        conjugated instances of single terms and thus could help to correct the
        inconsistencies, they also raised complex questions about what level of
        consistency in translation should be sought for a text such as Ms. Fr.
        640: this manuscript resulted from the compilation of techniques and
        knowledge over generations, gathered together from a variety of
        workshops, which was then, as the marginal additions in the manuscript
        show, worked over again by its author in multiple campaigns. The fact
        that Ms. Fr. 640 is itself an unfinished document perhaps makes
        appropriate that this Edition shows the traces of the work of many
        hands, and the process of interpreting it will go on even after the
        Edition site becomes static.</p>

    <p>Through this series of Text Workshops, the Project completed grad-sourced
        diplomatic and normalized French transcriptions and an English
        translation of Ms. Fr. 640, as well as customized encoding of the text
        for digital analysis and presentation. This process refined the
        Project’s methodology for collaborative scholarly editing and use of
        digital platforms, while simultaneously training approximately 45
        graduate students in essential research skills, and involving a dozen
        computer science students in historical research. As with much else in
        this Project, the collaborative process and the digital methods also
        raised many fruitful questions.</p>

    <p>As readers of early modern recipe literature will know, simply having the
        legible text of a recipe is often insufficient for understanding either
        the process being described or the desired product. Researchers may thus
        find themselves in a world of unfamiliar materials, foreign measurements
        (if any are provided), and peculiar descriptors that leave them
        bewildered. It was the task of the students in the Making and Knowing
        Project’s “laboratory seminars” to make sense of the manuscript’s
        entries (<i><u>Fig. 6</u></i>). In turn, their research essays produced
        in the laboratory seminar often allowed the students to refine the
        paleographers’ translations. See <i><u>Vid. 2</u></i>.</p>

    <p>Beginning in September 2014, Pamela Smith, Donna Bilak, Jenny Boulboullé,
        and Joel Klein began teaching semester-long (15-week) laboratory
        seminars (<em>Craft and Science: Making Objects in the Early Modern
            World</em>) in which MA and PhD students (and a few BA/BSc students)
        made use of the text work of the summer paleographers to critically
        annotate and explicate the manuscript’s entries. The Edition’s critical
        commentary about the manuscript’s materials and processes has thus been
        largely created by student-generated content. In order to create
        publication-ready critical commentary on the manuscript, the students
        undertook document-based historical research, object-based museum
        research, and hands-on reconstruction of the recipes in the Making and
        Knowing Project’s 1940’s chemistry laboratory (<i><u>Vid. 3</u></i>).
        Much effort by the students and instructors went toward crafting these
        multimedia “annotations” (as we at first called them) into a historical
        argument about what the students’ research (both textual and hands-on)
        revealed about process, materials, sixteenth-century culture and
        society, and the identity of the author-practitioner of Ms. Fr. 640,
        among many other topics on the manuscript’s historical and material
        context. While their essays contain information about their
        reconstruction experiments and their experience as humanities and social
        science students doing hands-on work in the lab, step-by-step details of
        their material reconstructions can only be found in their field notes
        (included in the footnotes of all reconstruction essays).</p>

    <p>Each year, students focused their research on a specific group of
        thematically related recipes in the manuscript: Moldmaking and
        Metalworking in 2014–2015 (<i><u>Vid. 4</u></i>); Colormaking (including
        dyes, painting, staining, varnishes, and imitation gems) in 2015–2016 (<i><u>Vid. 5</u></i>); Practical Knowledge (including Vernacular Natural
        History, Medicine, Practical Optics, Perspective, and Mechanics) in
        2016–2017, with Tianna Uchacz replacing Boulboullé (<i><u>Vid. 6</u></i>).
        In 2017, Sophie Pitman and Tillmann Taape took over from Bilak and
        Klein to co-lead with Smith and Uchacz the laboratory seminar on the
        theme of Ephemeral Art, and, in 2018, on Printmaking, Making Impressions
        and Inscriptions (<i><u>Fig. 7</u></i>).</p>

    <p>In all these courses, students worked in close consultation with
        academic- and museum-based scholars and practitioners, including an
        intensive two-week period each semester during which the Project hosted
        an expert maker who helped to hone the students’ skills in relevant
        techniques. In Fall 2014, we drew upon the expertise of Tonny Beentjes,
        Programme Leader, Metals Conservation, University of Amsterdam, in sand
        casting.<a href="#fn5"

    <h2 id="skill-building-in-the-laboratory-seminar">Skill Building in the
        Laboratory Seminar</h2>
    <p>Most students coming into the laboratory seminar were MA and PhD students
        who had been formally trained in the humanities or social sciences but
        generally had little experience in either a laboratory or an art studio
        (<i><u>Fig. 8</u></i>). Even those students with experience had never
        encountered nor attempted a historical reconstruction. We thus began
        each laboratory seminar with six to seven weeks of skill building
        exercises that introduced students to the subject matter of the theme
        for the year, as well as the general methods of historical
        reconstruction (<i><u>Vid. 7</u></i>). The students started each
        semester by working in pairs to reconstruct a historical culinary recipe
        from the sixteenth or seventeenth century with the express goal of
        simulating, as far as possible, early modern ingredients, apparatus, and
        methods. For example, students reconstructed a sixteenth-century “Tart
        of Hippes” (<i><u>Fig. 9</u></i>), a seventeenth-century chocolate
        drink, the mysterious “fine cracknels,” “Excellent Cake” (<i><u>Fig. 10</u></i>), and even some of the few culinary recipes in Ms.
        Fr. 640, including “Excellent Mustard.”<a href="#fn10"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref10"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> Students brought the results of
        their reconstructions to the following week’s class, when we discussed
        and digested the outcome. The point of this exercise was to elicit from
        the students a working template laying out questions, pitfalls, and
        resources for reconstruction that they could develop and employ in their
        experiments for the rest of the semester. An important aim of this skill
        building exercise was to encourage the students to reflect upon the
        process of reconstruction and its status as historical evidence, for
        this is a central emphasis of the Project: What degree of authenticity
        is sought? Which compromises in tools, materials, and time-saving are
        acceptable in reconstruction, and which are not? What makes a
        reconstruction persuasive evidence? How should it be employed in a
        historical argument? Indeed, this last question took at least a couple
        of iterations of the laboratory seminar to satisfactorily answer, and,
        as a result, the student research essays vary widely from year to year
        in aim, voice, and structure of their arguments.</p>

    <p>Reconstruction has been used in some fields, such as art conservation, to
        reproduce a given material as faithfully as possible in order to
        understand its handling properties, and, while this was certainly the
        Project’s aim as well, the course of a single semester was not enough to
        carry out the many experiments necessary to establish such knowledge
        with certainty. Thus, the goal of most reconstructions in the Making and
        Knowing lab was more like that of experimental archaeology, in which
        “proof of concept” is sought about the procedure by which an excavated
        object was produced. Can a particular process, with the materials and
        tools present in the environs of the excavation, lead to the production
        of an object like the excavated one? In their reconstructions, the lab
        seminar students deciphered materials and processes by searching first
        for similar recipes in texts composed in the same period as Ms. Fr. 640,
        and they studied museum objects to try to understand the aim of the
        entry they had chosen. They then planned an experiment or a series of
        experiments that attempted to follow the description of the process in
        Ms. Fr. 640, in order to gain “proof of concept” about whether the
        “recipe” could (or could not) produce the object or material in the
        manuscript. Sometimes, quite implausible recipes produced surprisingly
        effective results (such as breadmolding, marbling with varnish, and a
        mold made from ox foot bone and rock salt)<a href="#fn11"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref11"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a>, but all experiments would have
        needed much longer than a semester to be tested thoroughly. In the short
        span of fifteen or so weeks, students were naturally unable to carry out
        a full scientific or conservatorial reconstruction, nor could the
        Project undertake comparative scientific analyses on the results of
        their reconstructions, although students did seek out literature that
        analyzed extant museum objects to compare with the results of their
        experiments. Even in this short period, however, the students’
        exploratory reconstructions succeeded extraordinarily well in raising
        further productive questions, not only about processes and materials,
        but also about environments, life worlds, and practices of daily life.
    </p>
    <p>Beyond introducing students to basic methods of historical
        reconstruction, further skill building acquainted the students both with
        the year’s theme and with methods of data collection and recording of
        field and lab notes. In the second class, students were introduced to
        methods for keeping a laboratory notebook by Dr. Joseph Ulichny
        (Associate in the Discipline of Chemistry), as well as the methods used
        by anthropologists, presented by Professor Brian Boyd (Director of
        Museum, Anthropology), for taking field notes. The students uploaded
        their own field notes to a common platform (a course Wiki in the first
        years and then Google Drive) that allowed instructors to give feedback
        and observe student progress but also served as the primary repository
        for raw data produced in the laboratory. These hybrid field-lab notes
        are available to users of the Edition through the student Research
        Essays, where they are linked. All photographs of laboratory work are
        stored in an openly accessible repository on Flickr.<a href="#fn12"

    <p>Each year, the skill building exercises included recipes from Ms. Fr. 640
        that prescribe a simple method for making a quick cast of an object by
        impressing it in freshly baked bread. Once the impressed bread has
        cooled and hardened, molten wax or sulfur is poured into the bread mold
        to give a cheap, easy, and effective sense of how well the original
        object might be reproduced. If that object is under production itself,
        breadmolding allows an artist to try out variations before committing to
        a final design (<i><u>Fig. 11</u></i>). The process could also be
        used to hasten the casting of copies of metal reliefs, such as medals,
        in gold, silver, or other precious metals (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/156r/f/156r/tl"><u>156r</u></a>).
        Drawing on bread’s property of being pliable when moist but then
        shrinking and hardening when dry, the author-practitioner also suggests
        breadmolding as a way to shrink a larger object or vary the shape (fol.
        <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/140v/f/140v/tl"><u>140v</u></a>).
        The students’ work to research and reconstruct this recipe revealed no
        other contemporaneous texts that mentioned casting sulfur and wax in
        bread before the nineteenth century (a source that was not found until
        2019 by Min Lim).<a href="#fn13"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref13"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> As the author-practitioner gave
        no instruction about the type of bread he used, the students engaged in
        extensive research and hands-on trials of possible recipes for early
        modern varieties of breads, coming to find that recipes with clear
        instructions for quotidian varieties of sixteenth-century bread are
        extremely rare. The students began this exercise by spending two weeks
        learning to bake bread with sourdough starter (after the first year we
        provided all students with starter), which proved an adventure in itself
        given the lack of bread recipes. (See <i><u>Vid. 8</u></i>)
        Interestingly, the first recipe for “French bread” that the Team could
        locate (thanks to Sietske Fransen and Katherine Reinhart) comes from
        John Evelyn, Fellow of the Royal Society, who sent it to the Society in
        1664, entitling it “The several manners of making Bread in France, where
        by universal consent, the best bread in the World is eaten.”<a

    <p>Like many other entries in Ms. Fr. 640, this simple (and quite effective)
        process of molding in fresh bread led students to many further material
        and process investigations: in kneading, rising, and baking the bread
        for the molds, they encountered the living cycles of the bread induced
        by leavening—an important component of attitudes to nature and the body
        in the sixteenth century. In melting and mixing sulfur, wax, and tallow,
        they observed changes in the states of these materials. Bread molding
        also demonstrated to us all the existence of previously unknown (and
        unimagined) techniques. The new vistas of research into unknown objects,
        techniques, and materials that are opened up by “reading” the text
        through “doing” the processes described in it constituted one of the
        unexpected and important outcomes of the Making and Knowing Project’s
        research on the manuscript. We have learned how fruitful this method of
        reading and researching a how-to text can be for offering novel
        perspectives and raising new topics for investigation.</p>
    <p>These breadmolding exercises also provided insight into the mechanics of
        molding in one- and two-piece molds, training that continued in the
        first year of the Project in molding and casting in cuttlefish bone (<i><u>Fig. 12</u></i>), and, after that, in producing “sands” and
        “binders” to make sand molds and cast metals into them. Other skill
        building exercises included gessoing a panel (<i><u>Fig. 13</u></i>),
        for which almost two weeks were needed to apply nine coats (including
        drying and sanding each one), gold and silver leaf gilding, preparing
        and priming a canvas, then building up the various ground and “dead”
        layers, “growing” and painting out verdigris, making lake pigments (<i><u>Fig. 14</u></i>), grinding blue mineral pigments, and a variety
        of printmaking techniques. See <i><u>Vid. 9</u></i>. We found we could
        build on the previous semester’s knowledge and work. For example, the
        research on making sand molds in the first semester was then turned into
        skill building in the second semester, and the gessoed panels of the
        first semester were then employed as test panels for the students’ skill
        building in the following semesters. We found that skills learned in the
        laboratory were passed on to the next cohort of students, such as the
        “squeeze test” developed on the basis of fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/118v/f/118v/tl"><u>118v</u></a>
        for determining the proper consistency of the mixture of “sand” and
        binder for making sand molds (<i><u>Fig. 15</u></i>),<a href="#fn16"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref16"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> or the “paper test” for
        determining the proper heat of an alloy before pouring (<i><u>Fig. 16</u></i>).<a href="#fn17"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref17"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> In this way, we came to see how
        techniques, skills, and knowledge quite literally accumulate in the
        bodies, practices, and spaces of the workshop.</p>

    <p>A plethora of insights from the Project’s reconstructions can be found in
        the almost 100 student research essays, but one of the most important
        insights from the experience of the Project’s laboratory seminars is the
        need to formulate a standard of literacy in materials and techniques. An
        essential part of the historical toolbox for those historians whose
        objects of study are historical materials and techniques, including
        historians of material culture, art, and science in the pre-industrial
        period, can benefit from training in this embodied literacy. The only
        efficient—perhaps the sole—means of beginning to acquire this literacy
        is through hands-on work, and the reconstruction of historical
        techniques and objects can form a first step in acquiring this literacy.
        While students in the semester-long course can never reach the stage of
        true literacy or skilled and expert practical knowledge, they begin to
        appreciate the rigor and time needed to attain it, and they are impelled
        to ask new questions of texts and objects.</p>
    <h2 id="working-group-collaborations">Working Group Collaborations</h2>
    <p>The Project is fortunate in having many collaborators over the five years
        of creating the Edition. Foremost are the scholars invited to the annual
        three-day Working Group Meeting at the end of each academic year (see <a

        oversight on student annotations, gave lectures on the relationship of
        their own research to Ms. Fr. 640, and remained engaged with the Project
        after the meeting.<a href="#fn18"

    <p>Local museum staff in New York City were also crucial participants in
        Making and Knowing activities. For example, in 2014, when the class
        created portrait medals by casting into two-piece sand molds, we first
        visited the Metropolitan Museum of Art, where curators led an
        examination of relevant medals from the museum’s collection. Back in our
        laboratory, the group then worked with Tonny Beentjes to reconstruct a
        method for “Excellent Sand” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/118v/f/118v/tl"><u>118v</u></a>)
        which called for ground plaster and brick dust moistened with a solution
        of sal ammoniac and brandy in water. This was only one of a remarkable
        variety of recipes in the manuscript for mold “sands” and binders (<i><u>Fig. 23</u></i>). Our students took their sand molds to the
        workshop of Ubaldo Vitali, silversmith, conservator, and independent
        scholar, who supervised the process of pouring molten metals (tin and
        silver) into our molds (<i><u>Fig. 24</u></i>).</p>

    <p>These first attempts at casting both silver and tin were complete
        failures in producing nice looking objects, but extremely valuable
        learning experiences. In our excitement to pour the metal, we neglected
        the clear instructions in the margin of the manuscript that explain how
        to dry the molds over a fire. Our molds were thus too wet and the heat
        from the silver created steam, which resulted in considerable metal
        flashing and, in one case, a geyser of molten metal escaping from our
        molds (<i><u>Fig. 25</u></i>).<a href="#fn19"

    <h2 id="digital-development">Digital Development</h2>
    <p>Over the past five years, the Making and Knowing Project has proven a
        crucible of experience for its many participants in the novel modes of
        working pioneered by the digital humanities—collaborative humanities
        research, and experimentation in pedagogy, research, and diverse
        disciplinary methodologies. As noted above, the tension between the
        Project’s goal of a definitive critical edition and the digital
        humanities (DH) methods employed in pursuit of that goal came upon us
        slowly, only revealing itself as the Project co-developed—with Terry
        Catapano, Digital Lead; Tianna Uchacz, Making and Knowing Postdoctoral
        Scholar; Steven Feiner, Computer Science, Columbia University; and
        Dennis Tenen, English, Columbia—new DH courses intended for humanities
        and social science students (taught 2017, 2019), as well as for computer
        science students (taught 2018, 2019) at Columbia. These experiments in
        digital pedagogy included <em>What is a Book in the 21st Century?
            Working with Historical Texts in a Digital Environment</em> (spring
        2017) and <em>Transforming Texts: Textual Analysis, Literary Modeling,
            and Visualization</em> (spring 2019). In these courses, humanities,
        social science, and computer science students helped to think through
        and experiment with alternative formats, design, and visualization of a
        “<em>digital</em> critical edition” of Ms. Fr. 640. With Terry Catapano,
        the students in <em>What is a Book for the 21<sup>st</sup> Century</em>,
        created a minimal digital edition of parts of the text, organized not by
        folio, but instead by entry, and encoded with a new set of semantic
        tags.<a href="#fn20"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref20"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
    <p>As part of the Columbia University Computer Graphics and User Interfaces
        Lab (CGUI), Steven Feiner and Carmine Elvezio developed a course, <em>3D
            User Interfaces and Augmented Reality</em>, taught in 2018 and 2019,
        in which computer science students used the Project’s data developed for
        the Edition to create new visualizations not modeled on the codex
        format, and an app for taking field notes by employing augmented reality
        tools.<a href="#fn21"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref21"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
    <p>The Project’s approach to the Edition’s digital development has been
        shaped by commitment to long-term use, availability, and sustainability.
        All decisions and modes of work have been informed by two guiding
        principles: to generate and preserve all project data in sustainable and
        open formats while best facilitating the multifaceted collaborative
        research process, and to ensure commitment to open-access and
        open-source standards wherever possible. A digital edition that can
        withstand or respond to changing technologies is better able to remain a
        sustainable resource to the scholarly and wider community.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The design and development of the digital environment for the Edition
        since 2016 has been in the hands of Nick Laiacona, the head of
        Performant Software, and his staff, with the collaboration of Terry
        Catapano, the Project’s Digital Lead, and Naomi Rosenkranz, Project
        Manager and Assistant Director.<a href="#fn22"

           id="fnref22"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
    <p>The extremely intensive editing of the manuscript and creation of
        resources, such as the Glossary and Comments, during the final, intense
        stages leading up to the release of the Edition was carried out by
        Assistant Director Naomi Rosenkranz, Postdoctoral Scholars Tianna
        Uchacz, Tillmann Taape, Clément Godbarge, and Project Director Pamela
        Smith.</p>

    </h2>
    <p>Research projects generally result in the publication of research
        <em>products</em>, while their workflow and methodologies are maintained
        only in the memory of research team members. The digital humanities have
        offered new ways of thinking about dissemination and sustainability of
        scholarly products, but they also provide opportunities for evaluating,
        refining, and sharing the research <em>process</em>. Despite being
        defined as modes of scholarship, the digital humanities are often solely
        represented by products rather than the methodologies employed in their
        creation, and the publication of these digital products then effaces
        forever the work that went into their creation, and experiential
        insights are lost to the makers of future projects.</p>
    <p>Moreover, digital projects suffer from problems of sustainability not
        just through obsolescence of technology, but by lack of discoverability
        and use. Sustainability is not just a technological problem but also a
        social one. The Making and Knowing Project’s Research and Teaching
        Companion aims to ensure the preservation and dissemination of
        techniques and methodologies that would otherwise be lost in the hidden
        background and individual history of the Project and its creation of the
        Edition, as well as encourage use and interaction with the Edition in
        order to promote discoverability and sustained use. The Companion
        aggregates the Project’s many resources developed over the previous
        years, from recipe reconstruction assignments in the lab or kitchen, to
        syllabi for laboratory and digital humanities courses, to bibliographies
        for researching and teaching material culture, to case studies of the
        Companion in use. In addition, from our own experiences and insights,
        the Project abstracts a set of guidelines and instructions which can be
        scaled and adapted to the needs of a wide range of prospective digital
        and research projects and teaching initiatives, beyond the subject
        matter and institutional context of the Project. This body of experience
        includes:</p>

                    </strong> as a form of historical evidence and a tool in the
                    classroom. Reconstruction cultivates a type of <strong>close

                    of materials, allows the careful deciphering of terminology
                    and technical processes in historical making practices, and
                    illuminates attitudes toward the natural world and human

    <p>This Research and Teaching Companion was conceived as a response to the

        hosted academic and public outreach events, and successfully adapted its
        hands-on pedagogy for other scholarly settings (V&amp;A/RCA History of

        interactive culture in the humanities, using digital tools to share not
        only data and finished products, but also valuable insights into the
        work behind the scenes, and the integration of research and pedagogy.
        This involves questioning precisely what it means for a scholarly
        digital product to be “final,” and to rethink the concept of digital
        sustainability to include not just the technical sense of static data
        storage, but also a social environment of continued user involvement and

        Reconstruction Research</h2>
    <p>Reconstruction involves both subjective action, self-reporting, and the
        production of evidence by the historian in the present, a process rife
        with pitfalls, and the status and strength of its products as historical
        evidence must always be at the forefront of the researcher’s
        consciousness. It is useful to think of this method as “historical
        experiment,” drawing in part on the methods of the natural sciences, as
        Hasok Chang suggests.<a href="#fn25"

        reconstruction research combined conventional historical textual
        research, object-based study, and hands-on experiments to reconstruct
        the processes and materials of Ms. Fr. 640. All student research had the

    <p>Reconstruction has been especially useful for <strong>comprehending long
            lost or obscure techniques</strong>, for which Ms. Fr. 640 often has
        remarkably detailed descriptions. These include “incuse reverse
        casting,” or, as Ms. Fr. 640 has it, “Molding a hollow on one side and
        in relief on the other” (<em>Mouler cave d’un coste et de relief de
            laultre</em>), casting from life, casting in cuttlefish bone, making
        pilgrim badges, casting paper with raised text, casting sugar
        sculptures, techniques for painting on taffeta (probably for
        processional banners or clothing), a surprising black dye, making and
        applying black varnish for armor, making “gold without gold on silver”—a
        yellow turmeric varnish probably for furniture, paint for metal objects,
        entitled “Colors for Green,” <em>or mat</em> (mordant gilding), applying
        sulfuric acid on paper, reverse painting on glass, gilding on paper,
        preserving flowers in sand, animals preserved by drying in an oven then
        decorated with wings, and varnishes to withstand the rain.</p>

    <p>Some techniques are known from other technical texts, but the accounts of
        these <strong>techniques in Ms. Fr. 640 often contain puzzling
            components or interesting technical details</strong>, such as those
        for making paint brushes, counterproofing, building up flesh tones,
        polishing and engraving stones, distilling turpentine, the construction
        of a fuse for a siege weapon known as a petard, and lampworking. Other
        recipes needed reconstructing in order to begin to understand their
        implausible instructions, such as bread molding, and an alchemical
        process of producing a powder for gold by enclosing silkworms in a
        vessel.</p>

    <h2 id="historical-investigation">Historical Investigation</h2>
    <p>Some essays provide <strong>wide ranging historical investigation
        </strong> of the object that is the aim of a recipe, for example, the
        significance of roses in sixteenth-century Toulouse, bread in
        sixteenth-century France, the landscape of cures in sixteenth-century
        Europe, writing tablets, a musical automaton—a “spinet playing by
        itself,” the construction of decorative grottos, learning to draw, and
        sleight of hand tricks. Other essays compare Ms. Fr. 640 to contemporary
        texts, such as Hugh Plat’s <em>Jewell House of Art and Nature</em> and
        Charles Estienne’s <em>La Maison Rustique</em>.</p>

    <p>Through research and reconstruction, we also learned more about <strong>
            workshop practice and the nature of experiential or practical
            knowledge</strong>, as revealed, for example, in the
        author-practitioner’s use of particular terminology, such as
        “impalpable,” and his use of artisanal tricks of the trade such as the
        squeeze test for ascertaining the consistency of molding sand, and the
        paper test to measure heat. The research also yielded clues about the
        author-practitioner’s identity, as well as his level of education,
        knowledge and practice, and his familiarity with techniques outside of
        his French-speaking domain. Student research also provided <strong>
            insight into daily life</strong>, such as recipes for mustard, the
        use of noisy mortars by apothecaries to attract business, a method to
        train a dog (involving cheese held in the armpit, fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/131r/f/131r/tl"><u>131r</u></a>),
        millet consumption, woad cultivation in Languedoc, the regular use of
        stale urine, and the unexpected domestic production of sand for
        hourglasses (see <i><u>Vid. 11</u></i>).</p>

    <h2 id="failures">Failures</h2>
    <p>Students also found evidence of the <strong>author-practitioner
            experiencing failures</strong> in his practice, for example in
        making imitation rubies, or in making sand molds for casting metal. In
        some of the manuscript’s entries, the author-practitioner appears to
        have recorded his experiences, perhaps as he was learning, while others
        seem to be hearsay or observations from other workshops. When students
        made mistakes and went back to the manuscript to try to understand where
        they had gone wrong, they sometimes found that the author-practitioner
        had included a warning about just their problem, as if he too had
        experienced it. For example, while making molds for lifecasting, we made
        the clay walls of the mold too thin, and they collapsed under the
        outward pressure of the plaster “sand” as we poured it into the mold.
        When we went back to the manuscript, we found that the
        author-practitioner had warned us about just this problem, saying, “take
        heed to make [the clay circle] strong and thick according to the size
        that you want, otherwise it would burst, the sand being inside” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/145v/f/145v/tl"><u>145v</u></a>).

    <h2 id="material-imaginary">Material Imaginary</h2>
    <p>Especially interesting has been the insight provided by reconstruction
        into the author-practitioner’s <strong>system of knowledge about nature
            and the behavior of natural materials—his “material imaginary”
        </strong>—including qualitative material categories, such as hot, cold,
        wet, dry, fat, lean, sweet, and sour; material metaphors based on, for
        example, the materials of vermilion and sulfur, which provided a means,
        not so much to <em>signify</em> material meaning (although they also
        enabled that), but, rather, to <em>enact</em> principles of material
        process. The author-practitioner’s vocabulary of moldmaking and casting
        conveys a conception of the material world as animate, such as veins of
        wax (<em>filons de cire</em>) and breathing holes (<em>souspirails</em>)
        to vent the mold (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/155r/f/155r/tl"><u>155r</u></a>).
        The interactions between materials often demonstrate a view of materials
        being friendly or hostile. For example, “Latten is the enemy of gold
        &amp; the friend of silver” (<em>Le letton est ennemy de lor &amp; amy
            de largent</em>, fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/121v/f/121v/tl"><u>121v</u></a>).
        His material imaginary also included various areas or activities of
        emphasis, such as experimenting with the states and phases of materials,
        or trying to arrest ephemerality in living things through lifecasting,
        preserving plants and fruits, and taxidermy. In most of the recipes, we
        see that human utility is the overarching organizing principle in
        creating (often implicit) taxonomies of natural materials.</p>

    <p>The central preoccupation of the author-practitioner that emerged from
        the Project’s research was with creating artificial materials. This
        overarching concern with <em>artifice</em> reveals the imitation of
        nature by the human hand as an essential mode of investigating nature
        and natural materials through the crafting of objects. In the years that
        the Project focused on techniques for coloring diverse materials and on
        “ephemeral art” (temporary art for civic and court festivals), students
        reconstructed many artificial materials, such as emeralds and other
        precious stones, imitation jasper, marbled wood, imitation rouge clair,
        imitation damask cloth, and “color of gold without gold.”</p>

    <h2 id="reading-and-doing">Reading and Doing</h2>
    <p>The Project has taught its many participants how much information the
        reconstruction of technical recipes can yield. One of the important
        results of reconstruction is the new level of understanding of the
        recipes that it gives. By the constant moving between manuscript and
        hands-on experimentation, we gained an understanding of the manuscript
        that would not have been possible by simply reading through it in a
        linear way (which, given the extreme non-linearity of the text and its
        contents, would have been near impossible in any case). We have also
        learned from our hands-on historical research that reconstruction-based
        investigations can provide another window into artisanal workshop
        practices, but it can also make us aware of our inevitable “modern
        framings” or “lenses” through which we tend to look at the material
        world of the early modern period. Our research in materials suggests the
        inadequacy of some modern classifications to convey, not only the
        variety of that early modern material world, but also the ways in which
        practitioners thought with and through their materials and experiences
        to form hypotheses, taxonomies, and knowledge systems.</p>

    <h2 id="collaboration-and-expertise">Collaboration and Expertise</h2>
    <p>One of the challenges faced by the Making and Knowing Project is the lack
        of expertise among the individual student researchers on the project. As
        noted above, the laboratory seminars can do no more than give individual
        students exposure to the experiential knowledge of materials and
        techniques, and to make them aware of what they do <em>not</em> know. It
        is thus surprising how much the collective nature of the project and the
        many collaborators with different levels of expertise make up for this
        lack of individual expert engagement. The Project’s collaboration with
        other groups, such as instructors and students from the technical art
        history and conservation courses at the University of Amsterdam led to
        progressively more successful reconstructions, for example in the
        technique for what has been called incuse reverse casting, that is when
        a portrait, for example, appears on a medal on one side in relief and on
        the obverse as a concave form (“molding a hollow on one side and in
        relief on the other”). The Columbia University students deciphered the
        technique, and achieved proof of concept (<i><u>Fig. 26</u></i>), and
        the University of Amsterdam Metals Conservation programme students were
        able to build on this to accomplish a skilled product (<i><u>Fig. 27</u></i>). In a similar way, the skill building exercises, repeated from
        semester to semester, demonstrated that an oft-practiced technique can
        lead to new methods, shortcuts, and the accumulation of knowledge, as in
        the squeeze test, discussed above. Craft practice is often portrayed as
        simple, even mechanical, repetition of long established tradition. The
        constant innovation of science is sometimes contrasted with so-called
        rote methods of craft, but the Project’s experience indicates much
        greater similarity and overlap between these two modes and
        epistemologies of exploring the natural world.</p>

    <h2 id="recipes-and-emergent-knowledge">Recipes and Emergent Knowledge</h2>
    <p>Ms. Fr. 640 is, among other things, a collection of recipes. The research
        that the Project has carried out over the past five years has
        demonstrated that the modest form of a technical recipe actually forms
        an efficient vehicle for conveying active knowledge, and also gives
        insight into the nature of practical knowledge itself. By their usually
        anonymous form, recipes assert the collective and cumulative nature of
        practical knowledge-making.<a href="#fn26"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref26"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a> Like other written forms of
        practical knowledge, recipes can point to bodily action, but obviously
        cannot accomplish that action, nor provide for every circumstance which
        might bring about necessary variations in procedure. They are not
        precision instruments, but approximating and flexible tools. In the
        early modern period, recipes were often listed in series, setting out
        several slightly varying instructions for the same process or object,
        often simply labeled “another way.” The recipes thus formed an
        invitation to action, and, by their serial format, replicated the
        necessity of repeated hands-on testing and trying to work through the
        variables and resistances of materials to bring about a successful (and
        replicable) result. Practical knowledge is very different from
        propositional knowledge, which is easy to capture in a written proof.<a
           href="#fn27"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref27"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a> Practical knowledge always
        involves emergent phenomena, and its “proof” is brought into being in
        real time. A recipe, or better still, a compilation of recipes, thus
        indicates, in abbreviated form, the particularity, variability, and the
        emergent quality of practical knowledge. Recipes, then, can effectively
        capture in written form—to the extent this is possible in
        <em>writing</em>—this characteristic of emergence, as well as setting
        out a pathway for the acquisition of skill, by means of which emergent
        phenomena can be channeled and harnessed. Only by engaging in the
        practice of reconstruction—itself a form of emergent knowledge—would we
        have recognized this dimension of this remarkable recipe compilation.<a

    <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The Project has taught its team, students, and collaborators so many
        lessons in such a compressed timespan that it is hard to capture them
        all in the short space of this essay. One central lesson was the
        striking efficacy and stimulus of collaborative work in the humanities.
        Another was about the constant experimentation of the workshop, as we
        came to see that failure, repetition, and “extension” are regular and
        very important components of learning through experience in the
        workshop, a useful lesson in today’s high-stakes testing educational
        regime. Our experiments taught us much both about the unexpected lives
        (and instability) of materials, as well as their properties. We have
        come to better understand the author-practitioner’s bodily intimacy with
        some materials he used, and how this sensory engagement shaped his
        classification of materials into taxonomies. We have been able to
        delimit some parts of his taxonomy of materials and his material
        imaginary to see the ways in which he reasoned and experimented across
        types of materials in order to hypothesize about useful materials and
        probable results of his trials. We gained insight into his primary areas
        of interest, which included imitation of all types, from life casting
        roses in metal, to sleight of hand tricks, to transforming the state or
        properties of one material to resemble another, or attempting to alter a
        material to take on properties that are not native to it, such as
        altering a brittle material like sulfur by giving it the qualities of a
        malleable one such as wax. He worked to challenge his materials,
        manipulating them to take on the often contrary properties of another
        material in order to transform the rough into the “impalpable,” the lean
        into the fat, the hard or brittle into the workable, the sour into the
        sweet, and the elements of earth and stones into the simulacra of
        gemstones. Over the last six years, we have thought much about why the
        author-practitioner might compile this record of practice, and we were
        always interrogating our own practice and both the potentials and
        pitfalls of using our reconstructions as historical evidence.</p>
    <p>After these five years, we have come to think it very odd that historians
        whose object of study is historical materials and techniques—including
        historians of material culture, of art, and of science—have generally
        not seen hands-on engagement with the materials of their historical
        topics as an essential part of training and research. We have come to
        see literacy in materials and techniques as an essential part of our
        intellectual toolbox. Admittedly, the hands-on research into historical
        techniques and objects undertaken by the Making and Knowing Project
        cannot bring any of the participants to true proficiency in this
        literacy, but it can <em>begin</em> to provide such training. It can
        make all its students aware of what they do not know, even what they do
        not yet know how to ask. In that spirit, this Edition by no means
        exhausts the potential of this extraordinary manuscript (and others like
        it) to inform new histories of science and art, and to spur the practice
        of hands-on experimental pedagogy in the sciences and humanities
        alike.&nbsp;The Project welcomes readers and experimenters to this
        Edition who we hope will use it to formulate new perspectives on our
        many open questions, including those questions we have not yet thought
        to ask.</p>
