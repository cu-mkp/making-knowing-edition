            <p>A recipe for <em>Esmeraulde</em> (emerald) on fol. <a

                one of a number of recipes for “<em>Pierrerie</em>” (Gemstones)
                in Ms. Fr. 640 lays out the materials and processes the
                author-practitioner uses for all gemstones, varying only the
                colorant. This is one of two recipes for making emeralds, the
                other on fol. <a
                   href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/2v/f/2v/tl"><u>2v</u></a>.
                This essay considers these recipes within the long history of
                emerald making, a practice apparently so widespread by the end
                of the sixteenth century that the author-practitioner could
                observe that “the common people make emeralds &amp; cast in
                sand.” The reconstruction of this recipe necessitated multiple
                trials but resulted in the end in convincing emeralds.</p>

        100v is notable for several reasons: it is titled “<em>Pierrerie</em>”
        (Gemstones) and is only labelled “<em>Esmeraulde</em>” (emerald) in the
        left margin, as if glass gemstones and emeralds are linked in the
        author-practitioner’s mind. This is strengthened by the listing of
        ingredients in this recipe—quartz, red lead (minium), and alkali salt
        (although this last is not mentioned in every recipe)—that the
        author-practitioner makes clear also apply to the ruby, topaz, and
        jacinth gemstones on the following pages. This recipe is further notable
        because its green color is produced by an unusual method of grinding the
        quartz and red lead in a copper mortar. Finally, this entry includes
        interesting insight into daily life: this is a process by which “the
        common people make emeralds &amp; cast in sand.”</p>

        for making emeralds by using copper as a colorant in glass can be placed
        within a textual tradition that stretches back into the distant past: A
        Mesopotamian recipe calls for copper and antimony to produce a green
        glass.<a href="#fn2"

        discusses glassmaking in several entries of his <em>Natural

    <p>The eighth-century Arabic treatise, the <em>Kitab Al-Durra
            Al-Maknuna</em> (The Book of The Hidden Pearl) by Jabir Ibn Hayyan
        (c. 721–c. 815) suggests adding glass that is already colored to
        mixtures that in some cases include ground glass and metals to produce
        colored gemstones, as in a recipe for making “emerald-like green
        glass.”<a href="#fn6"

        Jean d’Outremeuse (1338–1400). Jean d’Outremeuse admonishes his readers,
        however, to use rock crystal instead of glass to produce imitation
        jewels, because crystal does not have the internal fissures of glass.<a

    <p>According to recipes found in texts contemporary with Ms. Fr. 640, rock
        crystal or river stones are generally to be used for manufacturing gems,
        as appear in seven recipes of the <em>Ricettario anonimo del
            cinquecento</em> (second half of the sixteenth century).<a
           href="#fn8"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref8"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> Giambattista della Porta’s
        <em>Magia Naturalis</em> (1558, expanded 1589), contemporary with Ms.
        Fr. 640, includes three recipes for emeralds, one of which calls for
        calcined quartz crystals, salt, and copper filings.<a href="#fn9"

    <p>While copper was regularly used to make green glass, green imitation gems
        made from whole crystals were more commonly colored with verdigris,
        mostly by immersing the stone in a colored bath.<a href="#fn12"

        for “Emeralds of Brissac” on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/2v/f/2v/tl"><u>2v</u></a>
        is an example of this practice, as are two recipes in <em>L’Arte
            vetraria</em> by Antonio Neri (1612); chapters 77 and 78 (“The Way
        to Make an Oriental Emerald” and “An Emerald More Charged with Color”).
        These recipes instruct the reader to combine ground rock crystal with
        red lead, then add verdigris and crocus martis to make a green gemstone.
        The preceding chapter 76 (“The Way to Prepare Rock Crystal”) instructs
        the reader how to calcine and grind crystals that are preferably “of the
        greatest possible clarity and beauty.”<a href="#fn15"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref15"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> Neri’s instructions emphasize
        the importance of proper grinding, stating, “you must grind the crystal
        perfectly, and of this have a good amount, enough to be able to make all
        the colors, because this is the basic material to make all artificial
        gems.”<a href="#fn16"

           id="fnref16"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
    <p>Ironically, in this chapter Neri emphatically instructs the reader to
        avoid grinding with copper tools, the process that is so essential to
        the fol. 100v recipe. If the calcined crystal is ground in a copper
        mortar, “it will take the color of the copper (from the mortar) and the
        iron from the pestle and you will produce nothing other than emerald
        green.”<a href="#fn17"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref17"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> Evidently, this method of
        extracting copper was known to Neri, but it is notable that he does not
        call what is produced an emerald, but rather refers only to an emerald
        green color. In his two emerald recipes, he includes lead but does not
        color the stones with copper filings. Instead, he uses verdigris, which
        appears to have been more commonly employed to color stones and crystals
        than copper filings, regardless of the type of process for producing the
        gemstone.</p>
    <p>The presence of two distinct emerald recipes in Ms. Fr. 640—one combining
        copper, quartz, and red lead (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/100v/f/100v/tl"><u>100v</u></a>)
        and the other combining verdigris, quartz, and red lead (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/2v/f/2v/tl"><u>2v</u></a>)—reveals
        that the author-practitioner was aware of the different ingredients that
        could be used to make imitation emeralds.<a href="#fn18"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref18"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> Both these recipes are part of
        the long history of colored glass making, a connection the
        author-practitioner seems to acknowledge implicitly by placing the
        <em>Pierrerie</em> (Gemstones) recipes in a series of nine recipes on
        fols. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/100r/f/100r/tl"><u>100r</u></a>–<a

    <h2 id="reconstructions">Reconstructions</h2>
    <h3 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h3>
    <p>The emerald recipe on fol. 100v calls for three ounces of “good minium
        [red lead or lead tetroxide], not adulterated by brick &amp; anything
        else,” one ounce of calcined “white pebbles that are found by the rivers
        &amp; among the sand bank &amp; paths, which are somewhat transparent,
        &amp; if they are perfectly transparent it will be better,” a
        <em>gros</em> of <em>sel de verre</em> (literally: glass salt), and an
        unspecified amount of copper obtained through grinding the materials
        with a “totally pure copper mortar &amp; with a pestle of pure copper.”
    </p>
    <p>The calcined stones and minium are ground with these copper tools into a
        very fine powder, which is “a sign that they have taken the substance of
        copper, enough for giving them greenness.” The author-practitioner then
        instructs the reader to add a <em>gros</em> of <em>sel de verre</em>. A
        variety of salts are used to make glass, something the
        author-practitioner is aware of when he adds, “the common people put in
        sandiver that they find at the glassmakers’ or apothecaries’. But alkali
        salt, as you know, is better.” For our reconstruction, we used potash
        (potassium carbonate) as this is common in soda glass. As to quantity,
        no other reference to a <em>gros</em> appears in the manuscript.<a
           href="#fn20"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref20"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> In our first trial, we used one
        dram (3.54 grams) of potash to approximate this measurement.<a

    <p>The author-practitioner then specifies that the mixture is to be placed
        in a crucible and heated in a <em>four à vent</em> for an hour and a
        half (<i><u>Fig. 1</u></i>). Despite the useful sketch in the margin,
        his description of the <em>four à vent</em> is too incomplete to
        reconstruct, so for our gem making, we built a furnace according to our
        anticipated needs.<a href="#fn22"

        the propane blowtorch could be inserted to heat the crucible (<i><u>Fig. 2</u></i>). We used a thermocouple to monitor temperature inside

    <p>We had to make a number of adjustments to accommodate the materials and
        equipment available to us in the Making and Knowing laboratory. We used
        quartz powder in lieu of collecting and calcining river stones
        ourselves, and, as a copper mortar and pestle were not immediately
        available, we placed the quartz powder on a clean copper sheet and
        ground it using a glass muller (<i><u>Fig. 4</u></i>).<a href="#fn24"

        sheet changed over time as the grinding of materials on it polished the

        the copper sheet to ensure more particles were integrated into the
        mixture.</p>

    <p>We put the mixture into a crucible and then placed it in the furnace.
        Although the author-practitioner states that the emeralds are done in an
        hour and a half, there is no indication of what temperature the mixture
        is to be heated at or how to pour, cool, or shape the molten substance.
        The lack of specific detail on how to complete the process meant that
        numerous trials with various adjustments were necessary. We poured our
        first trial into a silicone mold which melted. It poured out a brilliant
        red color, within seconds turned green, transformed to black, and
        ultimately shattered (<i><u>Fig. 5</u></i>). We hypothesized that it had
        been both heated for too long (resulting in the black color) and cooled
        too quickly (resulting in its shattering). It is equally possible that
        some of the material may have oxidized during the heating process given
        the large amount of potash in the initial trial.</p>

                account for this first trial resulting in a dark piece of glass
                that ultimately shattered. It may have been heated for too long,
                or the high amount of potash may have caused oxidation. The

    <p>In the two subsequent trials we omitted the grinding on a copper sheet in
        order to see what the color of the result would be without a colorant.
        In the first of these trials, we again used 3.54 grams of potash to
        understand whether there were impurities in it.<a href="#fn25"

        It was a dull, dirty brown color, possibly as a result of impurities in
        the potash (<i><u>Fig. 6</u></i>). We greatly reduced the amount of
        potash to 0.8 grams (approximately ¼ dram), and though the glass was
        harder to pour, the mixture produced a much clearer glass than in the

                quite brown and seemed dirty, leading us to conclude that there

    <p>For the next trials, we used copper powder (150 Mesh, Laboratory Grade
        Copper Powder) instead of grinding on a copper sheet to determine the
        amount of copper necessary to make a convincing green colored imitation
        emerald. In our fourth trial, we used 0.3 grams of copper powder, which
        produced a lustrous, opaque glass that was a very dark green but lacked
        the characteristic translucence of an emerald (<i><u>Fig. 8</u></i>).
        With the amount of copper reduced to 0.025 grams, the sixth trial
        resulted in an emerald-like object in color, luster, and internal
        appearance (<i><u>Fig. 9</u></i>). A separate experiment using 3M 600
        grade sandpaper on a copper sheet showed that two minutes of rubbing the
        copper sheet produced 0.025 grams of powder, the amount of copper we
        determined was necessary to create an emerald-like glass (<i><u>Fig. 10</u></i>).</p>

                copper needed to produce a green gemstone. The result of this
                first trial with copper powder was a very dark green and we

                necessary to produce an emerald. Initially, we tried rubbing the
                surface of a copper sheet with steel wool but many threads of
                steel wool came off in the process. Dust from the sandpaper may
                well have come off in the process of rubbing the copper. It took

    <p>In the subsequent trials, we focused on refining proportions of the
        materials, heating time, and methods of pouring the molten liquid to
        produce even more convincing emeralds. We poured the molten substance in
        a manner that produced small drops of glass, suspecting that smaller
        pieces would look more convincing, would be less likely to shatter upon
        cooling, and would be closer to what the author-practitioner intended to
        make, as they were of a shape and size that could be sold or set more
        readily by a goldsmith or jeweler.</p>
    <p>In our eighth and final trial, we also experimented with oiling to see
        how this would affect the overall appearance of our gemstones. Both
        natural and artificial emeralds have been oiled for centuries, with the
        aim that oil will fill in and conceal otherwise highly visible
        fractures. In an article on oil treatment of Colombian emeralds, Ron
        Ringsrud writes that while oiling “changes only the clarity
        characteristics of the gemstone, the color will naturally be intensified
        because of the fewer apparent flaws blocking the passage of light.”<a

        revealed many more fractures than the oiled stones. Although the oils

    <p>While we created plausibly convincing “emeralds,” our reconstruction
        raised many questions. In what way did the author-practitioner and
        others experimenting in early modern workshops distinguish conceptually
        between different forms of copper? Various states of copper were used to
        color glass: as a pure metal, as verdigris, and as copper oxide.<a

        apparently distinguished between the “emerald” that is created with
        verdigris and the green glass made with copper metal powder. Perhaps

        might also take into consideration the history of the emerald trade,
        which was particularly significant during the time Ms. Fr. 640 was
        compiled and written down (ca. 1580). With the “discovery” of mines in
        Colombia in the 1530s, the Spanish monopolized the global emerald trade
        from the mid-sixteenth to the early seventeenth century.<a href="#fn31"

           role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a> Emeralds went from a position of
        great rarity in Europe to wide use by eager buyers, a trend that ushered
        in an extended period of decreased prices and the emergence of a much
        larger pool of potential buyers. This may have stimulated the making of
        imitation gems. Mughal rulers in the Indian subcontinent were an
        especially eager market for this newly available gemstone, stimulated
        perhaps by the fact that green was regarded as the color of paradise in
        Islam.<a href="#fn32"

        be of equivalent value in some cases. There is little to suggest that

                British forces in the sack of his citadel of Seringapatam in
                1799. The authenticity of jewels in this and other Mughal
                objects have mostly gone unquestioned, in part because the

                analysis. Greater testing of jeweled objects in the future will
                hopefully reveal more information about the production, trade,
                and use of imitation gemstones globally. Permalink: <a

                <p>Cannella discusses the use of copper oxides to produce
                    aquamarine while further explaining that the color produced
                    with copper oxide depends on its state of reduction or
                    oxidation. When azurite is heated, for example, it
                    transforms into Cu2O, a copper oxide that makes glass green,
                    which was used to color green and turquoise Limoges enamels.

                            <br>
                        </strong>Take and put so-called topaz stone in liquid
                        alum and leave it there 3 days. Then remove it from this
                        and put it in a small copper vessel in which you have
                        placed pure unadulterated verdigris along with sharp
                        vinegar. Put the cover upon the vessel, close up the
                        cover, and gently keep a fire under the vessel with
                        olive wood for 6 hours, otherwise the longer you
                        maintain the fire, the better and deeper will the stone
                        be – only, as I say, with a gentle fire. Cool and lift
                        the stone out. Its condition will show whether it has
                        become emerald. That is to say, you will observe that a
                        green film has formed upon it. Let it become slowly
                        cooled, however; if not, it soon breaks. Put oil in a
                        small box-tree vessel many days beforehand so that the
                        oil is purified and the product from it can be taken
                        off. Put in the stone and leave it under cover 7 days.
                        On taking out you will have an emerald which resembles
                        the natural ones.

                        </strong>Take a good quality Kufic green glass, or if
                        possible a clear pharaonic glass. Pulverize it and sieve
                        it through a small mesh sieve or through a silk cloth.
                        Take a dish (of clay or porcelain) and put in it two
                        dirhams of <em>rusakhtaj</em> (copper scales) and one
                        dirham of green <em>tatiya</em> (zinc oxide), pulverize
                        both and mix them. Then from the pulverized glass 120
                        dirhams and mix well the whole together. Take a cup of
                        Damascus pottery [and put the mixture in it].
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Take from good red <em>natrun</em> two parts and from
                        <em>al-qali</em> (alkali) one part and with a total
                        weight equal to that of the glass, namely 120 dirhams,
                        and put them in a glass vessel. Pour water and submerge
                        these under four fingers of water. Stir slowly until the
                        materials are dissolved. Leave the solution to settle
                        and it becomes clear like tears. Take gently some of the
                        solution and irrigate with it the glass mixture that you
                        intend to tint. Then introduce the glass with its
                        ingredients into the glass-makers furnace and melt them.
                        Take precautions against dust and smoke at the finishing
                        and it will come out an emerald equal to the real one.

                        <br>
                        The secret of melting is to choose a good and pure
                        Damascus earthenware cup. Put in it the pulverized glass
                        with its pigments already mixed. The pulverized glass
                        mixture will fill two thirds of the cup. Then irrigate
                        it with the <em>al-qali</em> (alkali) and the
                        <em>natrun</em> solution. If you desire to make it like
                        a paste, then irrigate it daily and put it on a gentle
                        fire until you consume the whole solution. When it
                        becomes rather dry then introduce it into the furnace
                        while it contains some humidity and set on the fire
                        until it is melted. To test if it has melted introduce
                        an iron rod and dip it in the cup. A small sample will
                        show at its end. When it cools and if you do not see in
                        the sample any cloudiness and if it is clear and the
                        green colour is even then the melting is complete,
                        otherwise you will increase the fire until the sample
                        comes out as described. When this is done, make out of
                        the melted glass whatever you need. The firing of the
                        furnace will take two days and one night.

                        So also you may make glass of a very deep green. Take
                        very small fragments of burnt copper, which you must
                        afterwards mix with the rust of the same. Then grind it
                        again, with an admixture of shining glass. Afterwards,
                        put the jar, painted with this, into the furnace; and
                        when the flame makes it white hot, take it out. It will
                        not be of a beautiful appearance until it is cold; for
                        while the glass is made intensely hot, the violence of
                        the flame takes away the real beauty of the colour.

                        This will be the last for we must let our work be as
                        quick as possible, because the copper being heavy, when
                        it is mixed with the Crystal, doth presently sink down
                        to the bottom of the pots, and so the Gems well be of
                        too pale a colour. Therefore thus you must do: when you
                        give the tincture to a Cianus, you may easily turn it
                        into a Smaragde, by adding crocus of iron, in half the
                        quantity of the copper or brass, viz., if at first you
                        put in a fourth part of copper: Now you must adde an
                        eighth part of crocus, and as much copper. After the
                        colours are cast in, let it boil six hours, that the
                        material may grow clear again: for the casting in the
                        colours will make them contract a cloudiness. Afterwards
                        let the fire decrease by degrees, until the fornace be
                        cold: then take out the pots and break them, wherein you
                        shall find your counterfeit precious Stones.

                        Feed the Cock again, and for every ounce, give him four
                        grains of wheat, and he will easily lay hold of them.

                        <br>
                        You may do this in almost the same manner [as preceding
                        jacinth recipe]; and it will resemble the colour of
                        pleasant green corn. Dissolve silver with strong water,
                        then casting into the water some plates of copper, as I
                        told you, it will cleave them. Gather it together, and
                        dry it, and set it into a glass-makers fornace in an
                        earthen pot, within a few days it will become an
                        Emerald. To do the same with other metals, I will leave
                        to the trials of others; it is enough for me to have
                        found out and discovered the way.

            <p>NB: The first recipe warns of producing “nothing other than
                emerald green” by grinding rock crystal in a copper mortar and
                with an iron pestle. This would then limit the possibility of
                producing a gem of a different color. In the next two recipes
                which are specifically for emeralds, he adds red lead but colors
                the gems with verdigris and crocus martis. To darken the emerald
                with “more color,” Neri reduces the amount of ground crystal by
                half, while increasing the amount of red lead, verdigris, and
                crocus martis. While Neri mentions a similar process to Ms. Fr.
                640, fol. 100v, for adding copper to create a green (using a
                copper mortar and an iron pestle), he includes different recipes
                for the manufacture of “emeralds.”</p>
            <p>
                <strong>5th book, chapter 76. The Way to Prepare Natural Crystal
                </strong>
                <br>
                You should have rock crystal of the greatest possible clarity
                and beauty. Free it of any pieces of flint, chalcedony,
                quartzite, or other hard stones that may vitrify well but do not
                produce the clear lucidity and shine, or take the marvellous
                polish that rock crystal does in this procedure. These [other]
                stones always have an essence of the earth, and obscurity in
                them, while the crystal always has an essence of the air, and
                transparency. It closely approaches the quality and natural
                character of [true] gems, especially when the oriental rock
                crystal is used; it shows far more beautiful effects than either
                Italian or German crystal. Therefore, you should dress the
                crystal clean, and put it into a covered crucible. Keep it among
                the burning coals, where it will be inflamed thoroughly and
                fired well. At this point, quickly throw the crystal into a
                sizeable pan full of fresh clear water. Once it cools, remove it
                from the water, and return it to the crucible to calcine and
                inflame in the coals. Always take care to cover the crucible
                because no embers or ash should get inside; this procedure
                requires [the material] to be made with great cleanliness, and
                with exquisite care. Again, when it is inflamed well, throw the
                glass into the pan of water, which should be changed and always
                fresh and clean. Repeat this calcination at least twelve times.
                Now the crystal is well calcined, and ready to grind on the
                porphyry to reduce it to the finest powder; like sifted grain
                flour. Take the crystal, calcined and dried, and grind it as
                usual over a porphyry stone with a small muller of porphyry. It
                will crumble, and decompose like refined sugar. Be sure never to
                crush it in a bronze mortar, since it will not be possible to
                get the desired outcome. In such a case, it will take the color
                of the copper [from the mortar] and the iron from the pestle and
                you will produce nothing other than emerald green. Take great
                care in crushing and grinding it on the porphyry stone. It is
                very important here to use great diligence and patience. Grind
                it one time, grind it again, and then make another pass. Always
                put only a little onto the porphyry at once, which is to say
                half a spoonful at a time. Grind most of it impalpably, then in
                turn regrind it, and finally take a third pass and always on a
                porphyry stone as described above. It should be ground until
                when it is touched with the fingers it does not have any feel of
                grittiness, but it is, in all and for all, like finely sifted
                grain flour. Any grit will give the paste an ugly appearance,
                and will not closely resemble natural gems. Indeed the work will
                be ugly, and imperfect, so use diligence, and great patience. In
                this way, you will grind the crystal optimally. Within this lies
                all the expertise; it is the principle skill in the mastery of
                this operation. When you grind the crystal optimally, you can
                make artificial gems that in beauty, color, clarity, splendor,
                and polish by far exceed the natural, true ones. So again, I
                repeat; you must grind the crystal perfectly, and of this have a
                good amount, enough to be able to make all the colors, because
                this is the basic material to make all artificial gems.

                <strong>77. The Way to Make Oriental Emerald
                    <br>
                </strong>Take 2 oz of rock crystal ground impalpably, as I have
                described above [chapter 76]. Add 4 oz of ordinary minium, blend
                these powders together thoroughly, and unite them well so they
                incorporate. In all you will have 6 oz of material, to which add
                8 grains per ounce of good verdigris, finely ground. Therefore,
                in all give 2 pwt [pennyweight] of ground verdigris of material.
                Stir in 8 grains of crocus martis made with vinegar, as
                described in the seventeenth chapter. Mix this thoroughly, and
                then blend diligently with the aforementioned materials. Put
                them in a good crucible that is resistant to fire, and is large
                enough for the entire mass of powder. Fill it, leaving a space
                the depth of one finger. Cover this crucible over with a
                terracotta lid, and lute it securely, then let it dry. Now put
                it in a pottery furnace to bake along with the pots, plates, and
                other vessels. Place it in an area of the furnace that will
                develop a good fire. In this heat and flame, the material
                purifies and cooks thoroughly. Leave it to stand in as strong a
                fire as bakes the pottery vessels, and then remove it from the
                furnace. Open the crucible, and expose beautifully vitrified
                material of a lovely emerald colour. In grand works and in the
                form of jewels it will seem superior to oriental emeralds from
                ancient rock.
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>78. An Emerald More Charged with Color
                    <br>
                </strong>Take 1 oz of rock crystal, ground impalpably as
                described above [chapter 76]. Add 6½ oz of ordinary minium, and
                as before blend them together well to this material you will
                give verdigris in the proportion of 10 grains per ounce, along
                with [a fixed] 10 grains of crocus martis made with vinegar
                [chapter 17], totaling an additional 3 pwt and 13 grains. Blend
                this material together thoroughly as was described for the other
                green [chapter 77], in all and for all. As usual, put it in a
                crucible that will withstand the fire. Leave a space for one
                finger under the lid, lute it as usual, and cook the paste as
                described for the other [green]. This will be a colour well
                charged with marvelous oriental emerald.... Cook this paste more
                than the other one, in order to consume all the imperfections,
                which are usually in the lead. This paste with these doses will
                be softer than the above recipe, but the colour will be most
                beautiful.
