                in Ms. Fr. 640 is dedicated to sleight of hand. These tricks are
                part of a larger canon of “secrets” performed at public places,
                such as markets and taverns, and transmitted over several
                centuries and across the globe. Traditionally, conjuring tricks
                were judged to be deceptive and therefore illicit. Prominent
                sixteenth-century scholars like Reginald Scot and Agrippa von
                Nettesheim were determined to debunk such performances as
                fraudulent. Meanwhile, these feats of practical magic also
                conveyed early forms of specialist knowledge in mathematics
                (riddles), physics and astronomy (optical effects), chemistry
                (transmutation), and theatrical display (mechanical props). This
                essay examines the social life of sleight of hand in its
                widespread cultural transmission. This study also discovers
                striking similarities between entries in Ms. Fr. 640 and Jean
                Prevost’s C<em>lever and Pleasant Inventions</em> (Lyon, 1584),
                especially on fols. <a

        Historical Background: Conjuring and Experimentation in the Sixteenth
        Century</h2>
    <p>Why would anyone want to reveal a conjuring or a sleight of hand trick?
        By doing so, magicians, tricksters, conmen, and anyone whose profession
        is built on the skillful deception of others would betray fellow
        practitioners by revealing what is <em>really</em> happening. Yet, a
        plethora of texts on this topic have existed through the ages.</p>
    <p>The inherent allure of conjuring tricks lies in their persistent ability
        to surprise and fool us. The conjuror masters an understanding about how
        we normally perceive the causality of movements and events, in order to
        perform an act that counters these expectations and builds on an
        underlying but unperceived sequence of gestures. When analyzing a series
        of conjuring performances, the nineteenth-century psychologist Alfred
        Binet, inventor of the first intelligence test, realized that “through
        generations of cumulative experience, magicians had developed an
        elaborate working understanding of the mainsprings of perception along
        with a corresponding repertoire of sleight of hand techniques calibrated
        to induce perceptual error.”<a href="#fn1"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref1"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> The perceptual error raised here
        relies on the observer’s neglect of unconsidered causal alternatives
        while his or her attention is led astray by the conjuror’s skillful
        (mis)direction. The creative force behind the invention of conjuring
        tricks through the discovery and embodiment of perceptual errors has
        never failed to provoke both rapt attention and wariness in audiences.
    </p>
    <p>Conjuring may be one of the three oldest professions in the world (with
        the least obvious of these three being perfumery, perhaps).<a

           role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> Systematically-written records of
        magic and sleight of hand tricks appear to emerge no earlier than the
        sixteenth century, when there is an explosion of reports of conjuring
        feats and “how to” manuals for diverse forms of trickery and
        descriptions of pranks, illusions, games, and riddles.<a href="#fn3"
           class="footnote-ref"

           role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> Not all of these “revelations”
        can be viewed as having the same purpose. While some of these manuals on
        the art of conjuring present the reader with instructions about how to
        learn certain tricks for entertainment, others have a more serious
        agenda, which grew out of concern about the occult and ambivalence
        towards new empirical approaches to nature.<a href="#fn4"

           id="fnref4"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> Magic and science (or, natural

           role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> What counted as legitimate
        experimentation with the things and materials of nature was up for
        debate and existed in tandem with what was vehemently objected to as
        unprofessional charlatanry or heretical activity.<a href="#fn6"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref6"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> Sleight of hand tricks are one
        arena where this contestation of authority plays out.</p>
    <p>In a Janus-faced opposition over conjuring throughout the sixteenth
        century, two kinds of agenda can be discerned. On the one hand, Reginald
        Scot’s 1584 <em>The Discoverie of Witchcraft</em> presents a seminal
        treatise against superstition and the contemporary prosecution of
        witches, and differs from such predecessors as Agrippa von Nettesheim’s
        <em>De Occulta Philosophia</em> (1533). While von Nettesheim’s work is
        largely an anecdotal collection of magical hearsay and reports of
        supernatural abilities, Scot’s <em>Discoverie of Witchcraft</em>
        presents the systematic exposition of such abilities as fraudulent. Scot
        was influenced by physician Johann Weyer’s 1506 <em>De praestigiis
            daemonum</em>. Like his contemporaries, Weyer believed that
        supernatural forces were at work in the human world, but he
        differentiated between the delusionary and demonic influences to which
        he considered practitioners of magic to be subject. Weyer also attempted
        to distinguish methodically between the licit arts of natural magic and
        the illicit diabolical arts of revelation. Moverover, instead of merely
        recounting the many reports of occult events circulating at his time,
        Weyer further exposed cases of apparent magic or supernatural abilities
        as fraud. Scot followed Weyer’s example by debunking some magical
        appearances as staged tricks.<a href="#fn7"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref7"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
    <p>In the same year, another related text appeared which represented the
        most extensive manual for sleight of hand tricks yet published, <em>La
            Premiëre Partie des Subtiles et Plaisantes Inventions</em> by Jean
        Prévost (Lyon, 1584).<a href="#fn8"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref8"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> Although less well known than
        Scot’s <em>Discoverie</em>, it is of seminal importance to the history
        of magic, containing eighty-five diverse conjuring tricks described in
        surprising detail. Scholars consider Prévost’s treatise the earliest
        known work concerned entirely with conjuring secrets.<a href="#fn9"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref9"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> The unusual title speaks not only
        of “clever [<em>subtiles</em>]” but also of “pleasant
        [<em>plaisantes</em>]” inventions. Such a title signifies an entirely
        different attitude to the art of conjuring: creating playful pleasure,
        not maleficent deceit. Referring to conjuring tricks as “inventions”
        also marks their inherently creative nature as a form of entertainment
        and wonder, rather than as a source of crude or demonic distortion.</p>
    <p>We are confronted with two strikingly different attitudes to the art of
        conjuring here, a duality which permeates Scot’s and Prévost’s
        presentations of conjuring tricks. Both represent conjuring, on the one
        hand, as a deceit, an almost arrogant claim of possessing powers outside
        a specific natural and legitimate world order, and, on the other hand,
        as a skillful practice of creative invention, recreation, and pleasure.
        They both expose “jugglers,” or <em>bateleurs</em>, as they were
        commonly called,<a href="#fn10"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref10"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> as tricksters who deceive the
        common man.<a href="#fn11"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref11"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> While their exposure of
        conjuring tricks as deceitful practices is the proclaimed intention of
        their works, both Scot and Prévost convey a certain admiration for the
        creativity and entertainment value of these trickeries.<a href="#fn12"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref12"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
    <p>Alongside these two seminal treatises on conjuring and sleight of hand, a
        number of books of secrets and other “how-to” texts were written by the
        end of the sixteenth century.<a href="#fn13"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref13"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> Ms. Fr. 640 is one of them. This
        particular manuscript is a compendium of “recipes” for, and observations
        on, a wide variety of artistic and practical techniques. As an
        apparently unsystematic compilation of artisanal practices, its
        inclusion of tricks, pranks, and illusions initially appears puzzling to
        the modern reader.<a href="#fn14"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref14"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> What role do these sections on
        trickery play in this manuscript? What attitude towards conjuring do
        they convey, and how do these accounts of seemingly deceptive practices

        tell us about the social life of these tricks?</p>
    <h2 id="sleight-of-hand-and-trickery-in-ms.-fr.-640">Sleight of Hand and
        Trickery in Ms. Fr. 640</h2>
    <p>Ms. Fr. 640 contains a range of recipes for pranks and sleight of hand
        tricks, which are unusual when compared with the rest of the manuscript.
        These particular recipes are not scattered throughout the manuscript
        (as, for instance, are recipes for oils and varnishes); rather, they
        appear as a fairly discrete section in the first third of the codex.
        Furthermore, they contain hardly any annotations or revisions (compared
        to other such recipes in the manuscript as, for example, on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/64v/f/64v/tl"><u>64v</u></a>).
        Thus, the organization and presentation of the tricks in Ms. Fr. 640
        indicate that these recipes were collected from a single source and
        perhaps compiled at the same time.</p>
    <p>The following summary contextualizes these tricks through an analysis of
        their character and potential sources of origin and distribution. These
        categories are not intended to be exhaustive but to illustrate the
        general character of the trickster recipes for a comparative analysis
        (Table 1). At first glance, the recipes can be subsumed under the
        following categories of effects:<a href="#fn15"

    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>The categories in Table 1 indicate
        different options and venues for the tricks. While all constitute
        <em>close-up</em> performances, some recipes are more suited for
        spontaneous social gatherings in places such as taverns and inns (e.g.,
        riddles and pranks), whereas others seem more appropriate for places
        that can accommodate prepared or staged entertainment, such as
        marketplaces and theaters (e.g., translocations and transformations).<a
           href="#fn17"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref17"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> This becomes apparent when we
        consider the different requirements of skill, materials and props used
        in the tricks. Some need little or no preparation nor instruments; they
        are at most relying on quotidian objects (e.g., candles, bedpost). Other
        recipes build on different levels of skill and training (e.g., timing
        and disclosure of gestures in sleight of hand maneuvers, sewing,
        relighting the candle with a small twig), and the preparation of
        specific materials and instruments (e.g., tinted water, eggs filled with
        sulfur and quicklime, box with a double bottom).</p>
    <p>Indeed, the author-practitioner himself refers to different venues for
        these tricks when he mentions an audience in some of his instructions
        and descriptions. For example, on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/34r/f/34r/tl"><u>34r</u></a>
        he suggests making “a servant hold it [a candlestick] to the wall,”
        which evokes a simple social context such as a tavern as the intended
        venue. Another recipe describes making someone hug a bedpost (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/34r/f/34r/tl"><u>34r</u></a>),
        which could relate to potentially shared accommodations during travels
        at inns or brothels. In contrast to these kinds of impromptu
        performances, and in one of the few marginal notes in these pages of
        tricks, the author-practitioner explicitly situates his trick on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/33r/f/33r/tl"><u>33r</u></a>
        as part of a planned, perhaps staged, performance: “The conjuror ought
        not to amuse himself by watching what he is doing, but look at the
        spectators and give them plenty of good hocus-pocus words so that they
        look at his face &amp; not at his hands.”</p>
    <p>The importance of the potential venue and audience for understanding
        these trickster recipes is rendered visible in the case of fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/43v/f/43v/tl"><u>43v</u></a>,
        a recipe for “transmuted wine.” Transmutation refers to the idea that
        substances can change in their material state. Experimental inquiry into
        the principles of the transformations underlying such material changes
        was the occupation of artisans and alchemists alike. That said, it is
        not entirely obvious whether fol. 43v should be read in the tradition of
        alchemical transmutation or as part of a trickster’s repertoire:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Grate brazilwood very finely, put it to soak one or two hours in
            clear water, then take this tinted water &amp; add to it some clear
            water &amp; you will make wine as claret colored as you like. If you
            please, put a drop of lemon or orange juice in it &amp; it will
            immediately turn white. It can be drunk without danger.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>Here, the description of transmuted wine
        as “tinted water” might read almost like a mockery of wine to some
        modern readers, but water could have a range of meanings from everyday
        water to a quintessence, which might be metaphorical or a material
        substance produced by distillation, and used in the creation of
        medicinal and cosmetic products. Alcohol in particular is referred to as
        “burning water” in this context, for example, by John of Rupescissa in
        the fourteenth century.<a href="#fn18"

           role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> The reconstruction of this
        recipe sheds light on the meaning of “water” here.<a href="#fn19"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref19"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a> Perhaps fol. 43v is a recipe to
        probe the nature of substances by the artificial recreation of some of
        their properties (e.g., color), or it may be a recipe for the generation
        of a property to simulate but not recreate a substance.</p>
    <p>My reconstruction of this recipe opened up several issues about its
        ambiguous character: the absence of any <em>quantitative</em>
        description or any guidance regarding the proportion of Brazilwood and
        water to be used is not unusual in the context of the manuscript, but
        the recipe also lacks any <em>qualitative</em> descriptions by which to
        judge the coloring of the mixture. Fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/43v/f/43v/tl"><u>43v</u></a>
        does not contain a single color term for the tinted water, only the
        descriptor “white” for its “de-wined” version. Likewise, the qualitative
        description for the preparation of Brazilwood (grate very fine) allowed
        for variation as well as deviation from the manuscript’s instructions.
    </p>
    <p>To explore the range of coloration possible with the recipe on fol. 43v,
        I decided on three variations:</p>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>
            <blockquote>
                <p>V1: powdered brazilwood (ground in a stone mortar)</p>
            </blockquote>
        </li>
        <li>
            <blockquote>
                <p>V2: grated brazilwood in a “tea bag” made of cheesecloth</p>
            </blockquote>
        </li>
        <li>
            <blockquote>
                <p>V3: grated brazilwood without a bag, in the manner of brewing
                    loose leaf tea</p>
            </blockquote>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>All three “wines” were prepared with 0.04g
        Brazilwood in 50ml of tap water and soaked for an hour. They differed
        fundamentally in the way they took on the color of the brazilwood. V1
        (powder) colored immediately, and, the water turned a deep and saturated
        red after the mixture was shaken. With V2 (tea bag), coloration was
        barely noticeable at the beginning and remained the weakest of all after
        an hour, the water having merely adopted a slight rose tint. The last
        trial, V3 (“loose leaf”), was the most true to the manuscript. Here
        coloration of the water also started immediately, albeit more slowly and
        with less intensity than in V1. Nonetheless, given that they differed
        only in the use of the “tea bag” and not in the preparation of the
        material, the difference in coloration and temporal change between V2
        and V3 was striking (<i><u>Fig. 1</u></i>).</p>

    <p>Since none of the liquids looked like they could pass for wine after one
        hour’s soaking, I soaked a second batch for three-and-a-half days (<i><u>Fig. 2</u></i>). The samples differed in both taste and smell. V1
        had a markedly bitter taste and a medium earthy smell; V2 and V3 had a
        more earthy taste, but while V2 had a weak earthy smell V3 was almost
        odorless. The bitter taste was surprising as Brazilwood is said to have
        a sweet taste in the literature.<a href="#fn20"

    <p>For the second step in the recipe, the “de-wining” procedure, I took
        three samples of the extensively soaked variations to pour freshly
        squeezed lemon juice into each sample (<i><u>Vid. 1</u></i>). As V3 was
        already of a yellow instead of a reddish color, no real change was
        visible. Meanwhile, a small drop into V1 and V2 presented an immediate
        change of color from red to a deep yellow. It could have passed as a
        white wine, though, possibly a Grüner Veltliner. It was not, however, as
        the manuscript predicted, of a white, water-like appearance.<a

    <p>Is the recipe for transmuted wine a form of trickery or artful imitation?
        As an experiment to recreate an imitation, my reconstruction resulted
        primarily in a proof of concept. In terms of its use at the time, the
        recipe appears to have served as entertainment. It could have been used
        either as a prank, that is, if one were trying to fool someone into
        drinking it by having them expect wine, or as a prop in a stage play or
        theatrical setting. Indeed, with regard to such potential venues, the
        author-practitioner was careful to point out that “you can drink it
        without danger.” Overall, as part of the manuscript, fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/43v/f/43v/tl"><u>43v</u></a>
        conveys an interest in creating material transformations within
        performative contexts.</p>

    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>These other recipes provide even more
        compelling evidence for the overlap of tricks between Ms. Fr. 640 and
        Prévost’s <em>Pleasant and Clever Inventions</em> (1584), namely in the
        cases of fol. 33v (blood on forehead), fol. 34v (jewel in a box), and
        fol. 35r (water bucket on knives). It appears that the
        author-practitioner likely copied some of his recipes directly from
        Prévost: both writers were likely based in Toulouse.<a href="#fn22"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref22"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a> The eloquent and witty style of
        <em>Clever and Pleasant Inventions</em> and the preface’s mention of an
        association between Prévost and poets indicates that he may have had
        poetic aspirations, or at least, was an educated man in the occasional
        company of poets.<a href="#fn23"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref23"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a> Further research may be able to
        determine whether Prévost and the author-practitioner were part of the
        same social circle in the <em>College de l’Art et Science de
            Rhétorique</em>, a literary society based in Toulouse. On this
        point, certain textual clues in Ms. Fr. 640 suggest that the
        author-practitioner may have been somehow connected to the <em>College
            de Rhétorique</em>.<a href="#fn24"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref24"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a> However, this must remain
        speculative, as the name of the author-practitioner is unknown, and, to
        date, no records for a “J. Prévost” have been found in the
        <em>College</em>.</p>
    <p>Even so, there are strong textual reasons for identifying Prévost as the
        likely source for the trickster recipes in Ms. Fr. 640. Similarities in
        the presentation of the shared tricks are striking, especially in the
        accompanying illustrations. We see a very strong resemblance between the
        illustrations in Prévost’s <em>Clever and Pleasant Inventions</em> and
        in Ms. Fr. 640. In addition to the illustrations of trick knives (see
        Figs. 3, 4, and 5 above), compare, for instance, the diagrams of trick
        funnels to make blood appear on someone’s forehead (<i><u>Fig. 9</u></i>
        and <i><u>Fig. 10</u></i>), or those illustrating a trick jewel box (<i><u>Fig. 11</u></i> and <i><u>Fig. 12</u></i>) or the arrangement of
        knives capable of balancing a bucket (<i><u>Fig. 13</u></i> and <i><u>Fig. 14</u></i>). These images contain the same interpretive and
        descriptive components, such as letters to label parts of the props
        relevant to the description of the ploy. This is an important difference
        to Scot’s illustrations in his <em>Discoverie of Witchcraft</em>, which
        rules out this work as a common source for Prévost and the conjuring
        tricks in Ms. Fr. 640.</p>

    <p>Despite these striking visual similarities, there are also clear
        differences. In the case of the jewel box, the author-practitioner adds
        illustrations of separate parts not included in Prévost (see letters B
        and C in Fig. 11), and also substitutes a ring for the coin used in
        Prévost’s instructions. In the entry on making blood appear on someone’s
        forehead, the author-practitioner adds the suggestion to work the same
        trick on a wall.<a href="#fn25"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref25"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a> Furthermore, Ms. Fr. 640
        contains sections that do not appear in Prévost or that diverge markedly
        in both content and description. For example, the author-practitioner
        mentions a “conjurer’s pouch” attributed to one “Maistre Gonin,” a
        legendary magician who appears throughout sixteenth- and
        seventeenth-century literature on magic and demonology.<a href="#fn26"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref26"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a> For another trick borrowed from
        Prévost, “For relighting an extinguished candle between your hands

           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/33r/f/33r/tl"><u>33r</u></a>),
        the author-practitioner gives a more succinct description than the
        original, but provides an additional drawing showing the performer’s
        hands at work.<a href="#fn27"

        “For boiling an egg in cold water without fire,” appears in Prévost as
        “To Cook an Egg Without Fire” (p. 83). However, despite using the same
        ingredients (eggs, quicklime and water), these two recipes differ
        fundamentally in their method (Table 3). This divergence seems to
        indicate that some tricks were widely disseminated or part of trickster
        hearsay, but their interpretation and technique, and their knowledge
        thereof, varied. Given the apparent implausibility of some methods,
        together with Prévost’s skepticism about some of them (Table 3), it is
        possible that the author-practitioner simply copied certain recipes
        without fully understanding them or putting them to the test. Where
        Prévost’s recipe “to cook an egg without fire” would create the desired
        effect by the exothermic reaction between quicklime and water, only
        further reconstruction can determine the efficacy of the
        author-practitioner’s method of “boiling an egg in cold water without
        fire” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/35r/f/35r/tl"><u>35r</u></a>)
        by emptying an egg of its white and yolk, then filling it with quicklime
        and sulfur.</p>

        forerunners of cinematic effects. It is intriguing to see these tricks
        in their playful relation to early modern knowledge of mathematics
        (riddles), physics and astronomy (balancing objects and optical
        effects), chemistry (material transformations), and theatrical
        performance (optical and mechanical props).</p>
    <p>Examining the tricks in Ms. Fr. 640 in the context of their times, we
        find depictions of jugglers and conjurors to be a rich source for
        illustrating the popularity and dissemination of these trickeries. As
        discussed above, the ploy described on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/33r/f/33r/tl"><u>33r</u></a>
        (the illusion of piercing one’s body parts without harming the flesh by
        means of a prepared prop knife) also appears in Scot’s <em>Discoverie of
            Witchcraft</em> and Prévost’s <em>Clever and Pleasant
            Inventions</em>. Interestingly, this trick appears in visual form in
        the engraving by Pieter Bruegel the Elder, <em>The Fall of the Magician
            Hermogenes</em> (1564) (<i><u>Fig. 15</u></i>). This image portrays
        the magician Hermogenes surrounded by the various demons he had
        initially ordered to bring him St. James, who were then sent back to
        capture him instead. On the bottom left of Bruegel’s engraving we see a
        round demon with a knife piercing his hand and a bodkin piercing his
        tongue. Looking closely at Bruegel’s engraving, on the bottom left we
        see yet another trick from Scot’s manuscript: the “decollation of John
        the Baptist.” This trick shows a beheaded trunk with a severed head
        lying on a table, which, in Scot’s “discovery” of the trick, is played
        by two people. Bruegel’s engraving presents an intriguing dual vision of
        the ontology and meaning of conjuring: while the overall print narrates
        a contest of divine and demonic power, the scenery breaks down into
        detailed, individual descriptions of marketplace performances (such as
        juggling and plate spinning). This split vision between the spiritual
        realm and a quotidian human landscape as the place of the conjuring is
        shared by Scot and Prévost, while the author-practitioner of Ms. Fr. 640
        appears preoccupied only with the mundane practice of these deceptions,
        untroubled by larger significances.</p>

        the same tricks that appears in numerous contemporaneous texts. For

        “That One May Know What Hour It Is, Using the Sun and Your Hand, Six
        Months Out of the Year” (<i><u>Fig. 16</u></i>), presents the same
        procedure and depiction as an earlier text on mathematical games,
        astronomical measurement, and instruments: the <em>Instrument Buch</em>
        by Peter Apianus (Ingolstadt, 1533) (<i><u>Fig. 17</u></i>).<a

    <p>The diversity and wide textual dissemination of conjuring tricks shown in
        this brief survey, however, makes it infeasible to trace relations
        between texts with any certainty. The broad transmission of conjuring
        tricks no doubt occurred by means of texts as well as by conjurors
        moving from market to market, where their transience as foreigners
        aroused both fascination and suspicion, and perhaps reinforced the
        narrative of contest between licit pleasure and illicit deception.<a

           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref37"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>37</sup></a> In any case, problems of tracing
        transmission are illuminated by the fact that neither Prévost nor the
        author-practitioner of Ms. Fr. 640 discuss what was perhaps the oldest
        and best known sleight of hand trick: the cups and balls.<a href="#fn38"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref38"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>38</sup></a> This trick is played as follows:
        several small balls are placed under a number of overturned cups and, by
        dexterous sleight of hand, are made to appear as if travelling from one
        cup to another. This game has numerous variations, and some routines
        even end with the substitution of these balls with other objects.</p>
    <p>The omission of this from Prévost<a href="#fn39"

           id="fnref39"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>39</sup></a> and Ms. Fr. 640 is interesting
        because it is <em>the</em> signature trick by which the conjuring trade
        was perceived and portrayed, and it appears as the prominent activity of
        tricksters and conjuring artists in fifteenth- and sixteenth-century
        images, including several variations of <em>The Conjuror or
            Charlatan</em> by the School of Hieronymus Bosch (<i><u>Fig. 18</u></i>), and the aforementioned <em>Fall of the Magician Hermogenes</em>
        after Pieter Bruegel the Elder (Fig. 15). In parallel with card tricks,
        the cups-and-balls remained the most popular depiction for sleight of
        hand artists from the sixteenth century onwards.<a href="#fn40"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref40"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>40</sup></a> The fascination with tricksters,
        conmen, jesters, and conjurors, seen in the large number of texts and
        prints depicting their practices, goes along with the greatly increased
        publication of “how-to” literature. While Scot’s and Weyer’s works on
        witchcraft and trickery point to the larger intellectual and theological
        context of this fascination with deceptive practice, Prévost’s book
        reminds us of the neglected context of humor and entertainment, which
        often showed delight at misfortunes and misery, and could possess
        didactic aims in revealing the gullibility and follies of others.<a

        Conclusion: Imitation as a Source of Variation and Innovation</h2>
    <p>The examination of these recipes for trickery in Ms. Fr. 640 opens up a
        new dimension of this manuscript and of books of secrets in general.
        Conjuring tricks would seem to require great secrecy, yet they clearly
        had a wide circulation.<a href="#fn42"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref42"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>42</sup></a> This contrast between wide
        dissemination and secrecy reveals an essential feature of the “secret
        knowledge” contained in sixteenth-century “how-to” texts. As Scot
        perceptively remarked about his exposition of jugglers: while the
        principles of conjuring tricks can be discovered, the art of conjuring
        performance “cannot be taught by any description or instruction, without
        great exercise and expense of time.”<a href="#fn43"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref43"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>43</sup></a> As we have seen, most of these
        conjuring tricks belong to an established tradition of performance and
        circulated in this way well before they were systematically recorded;
        tracing any of these tricks back to a single original source or author
        may be impossible. Rather than pointing to an ancient source, these
        texts instead ground their authority in the practitioner’s experience,
        an experience that could allow him to “discover” the techniques behind
        the deceptions. Prévost, Scot, and the author-practitioner of Ms. Fr.
        640 emphasize their own sleight of hand know-how by including
        observations or statements of experience when performing these
        instructions:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>The true art of juggling consisteth in legierdermaine; to wit, the
            nimble convenienance of the hand… All other parts of this art are
            taught when they are discovered: but this part cannot be taught by
            any description or instruction, without great exercise and expense
            of time. And for as much as I professe rather to discover than teach
            these mysteries, it shall suffice to signifie unto you, that the
            endevor and drift of jugglers is onelie to abuse mens eies and
            judgements.<a href="#fn44"
               class="footnote-ref"
               id="fnref44"
               role="doc-noteref"><sup>44</sup></a></p>
        <p>The conjuror must not amuse himself by watching what he is doing, but
            must look at the spectators while entertaining them with hocus-pocus
            words to make them look at his face and not his hands.<a
               href="#fn45"
               class="footnote-ref"
               id="fnref45"
               role="doc-noteref"><sup>45</sup></a></p>
        <p>But because this has no appearance of truth, and seems utter fantasy
            (as do many things that are in this book), I shall content myself
            with mentioning this method alone, which indeed is true, as you
            shall find out by experience, which is most easy.<a href="#fn46"
               class="footnote-ref"

    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>Like most artisanal techniques, conjuring
        is a practice in which knowing how is not the equivalent of know-how.
        Know-how requires more than the mechanical execution of a principle: it
        instead involves the close-up and often extemporaneous performance of a
        deliberate and explicit deceit by which the audience’s attention is
        carefully directed in order to keep hidden the sleight of hand. The
        ability to distract requires an immense degree of skill and dexterity as
        well as a knack for improvisation to handle unforeseeable, real-time
        factors such as environment (e.g., light, wind) and other unpredictable
        circumstances, such as audience (e.g., age, size, education, mood, level
        of sobriety).</p>
    <p>How better to approach the understanding of this skill of improvisation
        than by the recreation of such practices? The importance of dexterity in
        sleight of hand indeed became clear to me through my own experimentation
        with conjuring.<a href="#fn47"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref47"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>47</sup></a> Although Ms. Fr. 640 does not
        contain any recipes with playing cards, I decided to learn two card
        tricks, and it soon became obvious to me why both the
        author-practitioner and Prévost were lavish with illustrations in their
        trickster recipes. Understanding what action to <em>show</em> or
        <em>present</em> to the audience at a given time in parallel with what
        action to <em>do</em> or <em>perform</em> without the audience
        recognizing it was best achieved through visual depictions. Despite
        these aids to understanding the principles of the tricks, the time
        needed to learn the gestures and timing was, like learning any embodied
        practice, disproportionate to the relatively rapid acquisition of
        understanding of the principles. Similarly, a talent for improvisation
        requires deeper hands-on experience to develop. A conjuror stands before
        observers who may be enchanted by a trick but fail to comply with
        instructions (for example, they may forget the card picked halfway
        through the trick). Other observers might heckle the conjuror by trying
        to figure out the trick’s principle in order to expose it or to disrupt
        it. And still others may inadvertently discover the principle without
        fully realizing it and require further distraction.</p>
    <p>In essence, then, constant practice by means of imitation and variation
        of a working principle presents a common element between secrets and
        recipes in both conjuring manuals and other how-to books, as “the
        repetition with variation teaches that matter is something to work
        through, and something through which to explore resistances, and in
        which to seek out the characteristics of a material in different
        situations.”<a href="#fn48"

           id="fnref48"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>48</sup></a> Rather than presenting concrete,
        step-by-step instructions for mastering conjuring effects, recipes for
        sleight of hand can convey only the general working principle of a
        trick. Revealing the <em>principle</em> and providing a description of
        its possible <em>practice</em> (most effectively done by an image) is
        all that a written text can provide to a would-be practitioner. Such a
        description forms a basis on which to imagine <em>variations</em> for
        different contexts and venues, and practice allows the trickster to
        explore his own understanding and inventive extension of the principle.
        By means of such continuous variation through reflective practice, the
        conjuror might develop an alternative description of the trick, or
        perhaps even invent a similar, yet hitherto unconsidered, principle.</p>
    <p>Weyer’s and Scot’s efforts to “discover” the human-produced mechanics of
        witchcraft and tricks aimed to delineate the boundaries by which human
        and demonic deception, and the licit and illicit, could be discerned.
        Jean Prévost’s <em>Clever and Pleasant Inventions</em> by which “<em>One
            May Discover the Trickery of Jugglers and Charlatans</em>” conveys
        in its title a less apocalyptic goal of providing “<em>Numerous Games of
            Recreation</em>.” It was perhaps Prévost’s emphasis on “<em>Feats of
            Agility</em>,” however, that attracted the attention of the
        author-practitioner of Ms. Fr. 640, whose recounting of these tricks
        purely as practices that one could imitate and vary to attain
        proficiency resembles so much of the rest of the artisanal practice
        contained in the manuscript.</p>

                <p>The earliest known record of a conjuring trick may go back as
                    far as Ancient Egypt. A tomb drawing in Beni Hasan that
                    dates to ca. 2500 BCE shows what appears to be the trick of
                    cups and balls (see the section “The Social Life of Trickery
                    and the Transmission of Secret Knowledge” in this essay for
                    more details). Today, this burial chamber is under water as
                    the area was flooded in 1966. To date, however, it is
                    contested whether this representation does in fact depict
                    the trick of cups and balls. See Milbourne Christopher and

                    introduces Prévost as a citizen of Toulouse. To date, not
                    much about his identity has been uncovered; he is
                    practically unknown and there were many other writers of the
                    same name at this time, a point mentioned by Jacques-Charles
                    Brunet in <em>Manuel du libraire et de l’amateur de
                        livres</em>, 5th ed. (Paris: Société Belge de Librairie,
                    1865), vol. IV, col. 867. Cited after Jacques Voignier,

                    Prévost records several mental riddles such as “To be able
                    to Guess Three Different Objects Which Three People have
                    Taken and Hidden.” Prévost, <em>Clever and Pleasant
                        Inventions</em>, 177. The same riddle has been found in
                    a French manuscript on mathematical games by Maistre Nicolas
                    Chuquet one hundred years prior, titled <em>Triparty en la
                        Science des Nombres par Maistre Nicolas Chuquet,
                        Parisien</em> <em>[…]</em>. See Voignier, foreword to
                    <em>Clever and Pleasant Inventions,</em> 211, footnote 10.
                    This trick is also contained in Leonardo da Vinci’s
                    <em>Codex Atlanticus</em>, fol. 207r, where Leonardo
                    attributes this joke to Maestro Giovanni da Lodi. Leonardo's
                    version was "How to teach what you do not know: If you want
                    to teach something to someone that you do not know, have him
                    measure the length of something that you do not know and he
                    will know the measure, which previously, you did not know."
                    Luca Pacioli (ca. 1447–1517), Franciscan friar,
                    mathematician, and Leonardo's collaborator, also quotes this
                    joke, which he includes in the section of "vernacular
                    <em>problemata</em> meant to stimulate intelligence and
                    mirth" of his <em>De viribus quantitatis</em>, a manuscript
                    available at the Biblioteca Universitaria di Bologna (codice
                    250). On Leonardo's relations with Pacioli, see Edmondo
                    Solmi and Sergio Solmi, <em>Scritti Vinciani: Le Fonti Dei

                    Pranks often involved nudity and public embarrassment, such
                    as in the trick “to make one danse naked” in Scot,
                    <em>Discoverie of Witchcraft,</em> 239. Other amusing
                    stories of tricksters were about their cunning in “forcing
                    men to undress and fart in church,” such as Barbara in
                    <em>Floire et Blanchefleur</em> and Wistasse in <em>Wistasse
