            <p>A recipe on fol. <a
                   href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/10v/f/10v/tl"><u>10v</u></a>,
                “For painting in oil on taffeta without the oil running,”
                advises using <em>batture</em>, a vaguely described priming
                material, to mitigate the halo-like spread of oil from its
                pigment when applying oil paint to taffeta. This essay
                investigates the efficacy of <em>batture</em>, a mixture of
                strong glue, water, and honey, as well as the role of its
                various components. Artisanal recipes and our reconstruction
                experiments suggest that the honey functions to “soften”
                (<em>adoulcir</em>) the taffeta, that is, allow the primed
                taffeta to dry flat rather than crease and curl under the effect
                of the strong glue in the <em>batture</em>. This recipe belongs
                among those entries in Ms. Fr. 640 that attest to the
                author-practitioner’s interest in ornamenting fabric and in the
                production of ephemeral works meant for short-lived, all-weather
                use, such as banners and pennants.</p>

    <p>BnF Ms. Fr. 640 contains two recipes for painting with oil on taffeta
        (fols. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/10v/f/10v/tl"><u>10v</u></a>
        and <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/42v/f/42v/tl"><u>42v</u></a>).<a
           href="#fn1"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref1"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> Considering the scarcity of
        recipes related to fabric in the manuscript, the recurrence of this
        subject seems noteworthy. These recipes reveal not only diverse ways to
        prepare fabric for paint but also suggest a demand for taffeta treated
        in such a way. Fol. 10v contains the longer of the two recipes and
        provides more details, potentially suggesting that the
        author-practitioner had a greater practical engagement with this recipe.
        The author-practitioner’s (later?) addition to the title “For painting
        in oil on taffeta” of the words “without the oil running” in a smaller
        hand might also indicate this.</p>
    <p>The manuscript contains few other recipes related to fabrics. In addition
        to the shorter recipe for painting in oil on taffeta, fol. 42v also
        contains a recipe entitled “Pounced design for scratching satin;” fol.
        <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/59v/f/59v/tl"><u>59v</u></a>
        has one for painting “folds in clothing;” and fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/15r/f/15r/tl"><u>15r</u></a>
        includes a recipe for “damasked cloth.” While the recipe on fol. 59v
        relates to imitating fabric rather than working with fabric, the recipes
        for scratching satin and for coloring cloth in the fashion of damask
        bear some similarities to the taffeta recipes. All of these involve
        putting some sort of design on fabric. This suggests that the painting
        on taffeta recipes might have been techniques for ornamenting fabric,
        perhaps in place of embroidery.<a href="#fn2"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref2"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> This is suggested by the recipe
        on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/67r/f/67r/tl"><u>67r</u></a>,
        which to some degree explains the interest in taffeta:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>The Germans make boxes covered with painted paper &amp; varnish it
            with glair of egg mixed with gum &amp; a little oil, not of spike
            lavender, but another fragrant one that resembles olive oil. Every
            work done with glair supports oil. It is with this that painters
            trick the poor peasants, painting their bands of taffeta with this
            glair, to be done sooner. But the first rain carries away
            everything.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>Here the author-practitioner mentions that
        taffeta was used to make something similar to a banner for peasants, and
        he comments on the inferior quality of egg whites (<em>glaire
            doeuf</em>) for underlayers. Similar information on the use of
        taffeta for banners, but with an underlayer calling for animal glue,
        starch, and honey, appears in the De Mayerne manuscript, compiled by
        Swiss physician Sir Théodore Turquet de Mayerne (1573–1655) in the
        seventeenth century:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>You need to prepare the cloth with fish or leather scrap glue, mixed
            with a bit of starch for strengthening. Heat it with a little honey
            and apply this mixture to your fabric. Let it dry and then coat it
            with oil with lead monoxide. […] When I wondered whether the honey
            would dry, he answered yes, because painters who make flags and
            emblems for the purposes of war use it as well out of fear that the
            taffeta, coated with glue to avoid the pulling of the colors applied
            with oil paint, will become brittle and show cracks and creases.<a

               role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>According to these two recipes, pretreated
        taffeta was commonly used by peasants and soldiers for making banners
        painted with oil paint, but doubt remains as to what type of taffeta was
        used and whether it is the same as that used for clothing. Notably, the
        recipe in the De Mayerne collection is informed by practice, indicated
        especially by the many detailed marginal notes.<a href="#fn4"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref4"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
    <p>The use of taffeta for banners can also be found in <em>Il libro
            dell’arte</em> of Florentine craftsman Cennino Cennini (ca.
        1360–before 1427), who, in the section “Work on Cloth: Painting and
        Gilding,” mentions that “sometimes these banners, which are made for
        churches, get carried outdoors in the rain; and therefore you must take
        care to get a good clear varnish, and when you varnish the painting,
        varnish these diadems and gold grounds a little, too.”<a href="#fn5"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref5"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> Elsewhere in the text, Cennini
        refers to painted silk (though not taffeta specifically) and how banners
        made of it are to be varnished.<a href="#fn6"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref6"

    <p>Although intentionally ephemeral, such works were nonetheless destined
        for outdoor use and thus needed to be waterproof. The ability to
        withstand water was clearly a concern for the author-practitioner of Ms.
        Fr. 640: the recipe on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/67r/f/67r/tl"><u>67r</u></a>
        notes that the layer of egg white on the taffeta will be ruined by first
        rain. Similarly, a recipe on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/32r/f/32r/tl"><u>32r</u></a>
        mentions a layer of <em>batture</em>, said to be damaged in the rain:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Common painters &amp; scribes make batture, that is joiner’s glue
            tempered with water on the fire, moderately clear, mixed with very
            little honey, that is to say a few drops to make it stick. And with
            it they form letters, or that which they want to gild, with a
            paintbrush, and immediately after layer the gold, but they never do
            their work quite neatly, and if there is a lot of honey it dries
            only with great difficulty. This layer is undone in the rain.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Outside of Ms. Fr. 640, there is little evidence for techniques to paint
        on taffeta, with one notable exception: an entry entitled “For painting
        in oil on taffeta” (<em>Pour peindre à huile sur le taffetas</em>) in
        <em>Élémens de peinture pratique</em>. This volume, authored by Roger de
        Piles (1635–1709) and originally published in 1684, was augmented and
        reissued in 1766 by Charles-Antoine Jombert (1712–1784). It is Jombert’s
        edition that that includes the recipe for oil on taffeta:<a href="#fn8"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref8"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>One must first prepare the taffeta with a gum, of which here is the
            composition. Take fish glue as large as a bean, cut it in little
            pieces, &amp; soak it for twelve hours in a glass of water. After,
            melt it on the fire just until boiling, then drain it and let it get
            cold again. When one wants to use it, one must heat it &amp; having
            stretched your taffeta well, apply it well-heated there with a
            sponge, as evenly as possible. The taffeta being dry, you can lay
            your colors there, without worrying that they will soak in or that
            they will spread more than they should.<a href="#fn9"
               class="footnote-ref"
               id="fnref9"
               role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>While this recipe contains fewer
        components than that on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/10v/f/10v/tl"><u>10v</u></a>
        of Ms. Fr. 640, the general procedure (i.e., applying glue on taffeta)
        is the same. Most interesting in Jombert’s edition is the description of
        what this glue layer prevents. While fol. 10v mentions oil running,
        Jombert’s recipe says it prevents colors from soaking in or spreading
        more than they should. This particular word choice better reflects the
        outcome of our reconstruction, as will be discussed below.</p>
    <h2 id="materials-and-methods">Materials and Methods</h2>
    <p>While a relatively simple recipe, many of the components on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/10v/f/10v/tl"><u>10v</u></a>
        are vaguely described. Chief among these vague materials is
        <em>batture</em>, which the Making and Knowing Project has left
        untranslated. Although the author-practitioner defines <em>batture</em>
        as “strong glue [<em>colle forte</em>] soaked for 24 hours in water then
        gently brought to boil so that it is hardly strong,”<a href="#fn10"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref10"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> this explanation raises further
        questions. Randle Cotgrave’s French-English <em>Dictionarie</em> (1611)
        translates <em>colle forte</em> as “ordinarie white glue; as in
        <em>Colle de cerf</em>,” and in turn translates <em>colle de cerf</em>
        as “white, and cleere-coloured glue; made of the skinnes of all kind of
        foure-footed beastes.”<a href="#fn11"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref11"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> This suggests that the
        author-practitioner might have used an animal-skin glue for the
        <em>batture</em>. Another recipe in the manuscript, “For layering gold
        in distemper” on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/32r/f/32r/tl"><u>32r</u></a>,
        also calls for <em>batture</em>. In this recipe, <em>batture</em> is
        described as “joiner’s glue tempered with water on the fire, moderately
        clear, mixed with very little honey, that is to say a few drops to make
        it stick.” A search through the manuscript for “joiners” and “joiner’s
        glue” reveals a relevant recipe on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/7r/f/7r/tl"><u>7r</u></a>,
        “Fish glue or isinglass and mouth glue.”<a href="#fn12"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref12"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> On fish glue the
        author-practitioner writes,</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>It is made from codfish skin, boiled rather than being salted.
            Joiners glue their masterpieces with it and guitar maker[illegible]
            use it for delicate works. It wants to be strongly beaten, then
            soaked gently in barely boiling water.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>And he gives alternatives to using water
        in a marginal note on fol. 7r, writing, “One beats it and soaks it in
        white wine for one night, then one melts it on a slow fire. Others soak
        it in eau-de-vie.” Interestingly, the author added “and mouth glue” in a
        smaller hand to the title “Fish glue or isinglass,” suggesting that he
        might have added the short paragraph on mouth glue later, thus grouping
        together different glue recipes that he could have tried himself or
        observed others making at different times.<a href="#fn13"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref13"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
    <p>The Technical Art History students at the University of Amsterdam
        reconstructed a fish glue made from sturgeon stomach, though they did
        not pursue the experiment using a <em>batture</em> made from this. In
        their experiments, skin glue and parchment glue provided the best
        adhesive results. Accordingly, we tried two different procedures for our
        reconstruction of <em>batture</em>, one using parchment glue—although
        fish glue might have been the more appropriate choice—and another using
        rabbit skin glue, relying on Cotgrave’s definition of <em>colle
            forte</em> as glue from the skins of four-footed animals.</p>
    <p>The place of honey in the <em>batture</em> was clarified further by
        comparing the recipe on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/10v/f/10v/tl"><u>10v</u></a>,
        in which a little honey is used to “soften” (<em>adoulcir</em>) the
        <em>batture</em>, with the more detailed recipe on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/32r/f/32r/tl"><u>32r</u></a>,
        which specifies that only a few drops should be used in order to thicken
        the mixture, for too much honey would make it hard to dry. This provided
        information about the quantity and function of the honey.<a href="#fn14"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref14"

    <p>Fol. 10v specifies “taffeta” as the material to be employed, a term that
        has denoted a variety of fabrics at different times. The

    <p>We made rabbit skin glue and parchment glue (the latter following the

        in Ms. Fr. 640) as the basis for two trials of <em>batture</em>. The
        rabbit skin glue was viscous, while the parchment glue remained liquid,
        which may have affected the efficacy of the <em>batture</em>. We
        separated our taffeta (plain woven silk) into four squares for several
        trials in order to isolate certain variables. We were curious about the
        function of <em>batture</em>, particularly the efficacy of a diluted
        strong glue (<em>colle forte</em>). Thus we made a <em>batture</em> by
        diluting our “strong glues” in water as described on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/10v/f/10v/tl"><u>10v</u></a>
        (using a trial both with the rabbit skin glue and with the parchment
        glue), and for comparison we also applied undiluted strong glues. To
        determine the effect of the honey, we added different quantities to
        determine whether it worked to soften the fabric or to change the drying
        speed.<a href="#fn20"

    <h2 id="observations-and-conclusions">Observations and Conclusions</h2>
    <p>After applying the <em>batture</em> and the undiluted rabbit skin glue,
        both mixed with different amounts of honey, and allowing the layers to
        dry on the taffeta, we painted a line vertically and diagonally on each
        square. We made oil paints of linseed oil (both with cold pressed and
        with stand oil) and madder lake pigment.<a href="#fn21"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref21"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a> As we painted the lines, we
        noticed that the oil spread further beyond the edges of the lines on
        some test squares, namely those which were coated with <em>batture</em>,
        leaving a dark shadow of oil around the painted line (<i><u>Fig.
                3</u></i>). These oil “haloes” did not appear on other squares
        that we prepared with undiluted rabbit skin glue (<i><u>Fig. 4</u></i>).
        After a moment, the oil shadows became increasingly obvious, and a week
        later the oil shadows appeared on all squares although to varying
        degrees. The control taffeta (with no priming layer applied before the
        oil paint) had large oil shadows (<i><u>Fig. 5</u></i>). However, these
        shadows were obvious only when examined carefully. Moreover, although
        the oil spread further over time, it also became less obvious
        (<i><u>Fig. 6</u></i>). If the taffeta had been used as a banner, as we
        assume, the spreading oil might not have been visible from a distance.<a

        paints and different pigments (e.g., in a painted scene). Though this
        kind of interaction was not observable from our experiments, the
        Technical Art History students at the University of Amsterdam<a

        scene painted in different oil colors and covering a larger area of
        taffeta that demonstrated the same tendency of the oil to spread. This
        spreading does not appear to have affected the other details in the
        painted image (<i><u>Fig. 7</u></i>). They also applied gold to the
        cloth, following the suggestion of the recipe on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/10v/f/10v/tl"><u>10v</u></a>
        that the <em>batture</em> can alternatively serve as a base for a gold
        layer. Their results show that the gilding appears visually unaffected
        by the spread of the oil from the parts painted in oil.</p>

    <p>On the taffeta with the undiluted rabbit skin glue layer, the shadows of
        the oil “running” did not appear immediately but only after about two
        weeks. This might suggest that the preparation of textiles for oil
        painting with glue layers could have been intended for short-term use.
    </p>
    <p>Our experiments with rabbit skin glue <em>batture</em> (i.e., rabbit skin
        glue diluted in water) were less successful than undiluted rabbit skin
        glue, as shadows appeared within an hour on the former. Although our
        <em>batture</em> was more effective in preventing the oil from running
        than was the control taffeta with no priming layer whatsoever beneath
        the oil paint, it did not significantly alter the spreading of the oil
        over time. A possible explanation may be that we diluted our glue with
        too much water. However, we were able to determine that the stronger the
        glue (i.e., the less diluted), the more stable the oil paint (i.e., the
        less it spread). This observation was supported by our experiments with
        parchment glue. The parchment glue that we made was much less strong
        than the strong glue (<em>colle forte</em>) made from animal skins: it
        became very dilute in the water, was hardly viscous, and was not
        adhesive. The oil spread further on the taffeta on which it was applied
        (<i><u>Fig. 8</u></i>).</p>

    <p>Why then did the author-practitioner experiment with a <em>batture</em>
        of diluted glue if undiluted, strong glue apparently works best for the
        application of oil paint on taffeta “without the oil running”? Our
        experiments with undiluted rabbit skin glue provide a possible answer:
        the stronger the glue, the more textured and creased the taffeta
        becomes, and its edges have a tendency to curl (<i><u>Fig. 9</u></i>).
        This suggests that the reason for diluting the glue might be to soften
        the rigidity of the fabric, with the honey perhaps increasing the
        flexibility further.<a href="#fn24"

    <p>In the experiments with rabbit skin glue, we made trial groups to compare
        the effects of adding 1 ml versus 2 ml of honey. As mentioned in the De
        Mayerne recipe, adding (some) honey did not seem to prolong the drying
        time significantly. Indeed, both trial groups dried quickly (i.e.,
        within half an hour), and the one with 2 ml honey even dried several
        minutes sooner. However, our results showed no obvious difference in the
        effect of 1 ml versus 2 ml of honey to soften (<em>adoulcir</em>) the
        taffeta. Yet, we did observe another difference when we increased the
        amount of honey. The taffeta square primed with our parchment glue
        <em>batture</em>, which included 5 ml of honey, remained more even,
        lying flush with the surface (<i><u>Fig. 10</u></i>). It must be noted,
        however, that the parchment glue was so liquid that it flattened the
        taffeta significantly, unlike the rabbit skin glue trials, which dried
        with noticeable ridges.</p>

    <p>We succeeded with our trials in isolating and understanding the effects
        of the different ingredients in the recipe “for painting oil on taffeta
        without the oil running.” Our results, and those from Professor Bol’s
        Technical Art History students at the University of Amsterdam, suggest
        that the author-practitioner was interested in ephemeral painted cloths,
        such as decorated banners, produced for public or military (outdoor)
        events, that were probably meant for short-term use and likely to be
        seen from afar rather than close up.</p>
    <p>Our experiments show that the <em>batture</em> layer containing glue is
        an important agent in preventing oil from spreading beyond the confines
        of the pigmented areas on painted taffeta. One effect of glue, however,
        is to pull and crease the fabric upon drying. To mitigate this, honey is
        added. The taffeta recipes in Ms. Fr. 640 seem to suggest that the
        author-practitioner was experimenting to achieve an optimal visual
        effect, one that best mitigated the effects of oil “running” and of the
        creases and ridges that appeared when a glue-based priming was applied.

                <p>In the original manuscript there are many words crossed out

                    with turpentine). Then he revised to the definition as it
                    stands now. Since the new definition follows right after the
                    crossed-out words rather than as a marginal note, it can be
                    assumed that the author modified the definition as he was
                    writing the text. It is not clear if he mixed up different

                    <em>taftha</em>, which means a very fine, plain weave, silk

                    taffeta. The seven glue trials were as follows:</p>
                <p>1.1: 25 ml rabbit skin glue, 1 ml honey</p>
                <p>2.1: 25 ml rabbit skin glue, 2 ml honey</p>
                <p>3.1: 25 ml rabbit skin glue <em>batture</em> (i.e., diluted
                    in water in a 1:5 glue to water ratio), 1 ml honey</p>
                <p>4.1: 25 ml rabbit skin glue <em>batture</em> (i.e., diluted
                    in water in a 1:5 glue to water ratio), 2 ml honey</p>
                <p>5.1: 25 ml parchment glue <em>batture</em> (i.e., diluted in
                    water in a 1:5 glue to water ratio), 1 ml honey</p>
                <p>6.1: 25 ml parchment glue <em>batture</em> (i.e., diluted in
                    water in a 1:5 glue to water ratio), 5 ml honey</p>
                <p>7.1: 20 ml parchment glue, 1 ml honey.</p>

                <p>Our initial interpretation of “oil running” was oil dripping
                    down the surface so we decided that a single line would be
                    enough to determine the effects of the different
                    ingredients. Painting something more substantial as
                    Professor Bol’s Technical Art History students did
                    demonstrates the effect of the oil “running” as it might
                    have been seen in a larger scene. For more information on
                    this point, please see Bowen and Lou, “Painting in Oil on
                    Taffeta I,” <a

                <p>Again it should be noted that the effects of the oil
                    spreading might be different if interacting with more oil
                    paints in different colors, i.e., a painted scene. Though
                    this was not observable from our experiments, the
                    reconstructions of the Amsterdam group seem to indicate that
                    it could make a difference. See Fig. 7.<a href="#fnref22"
