                use wax for making “seals,” although the types of seals the
                author-practitioner had in mind are unclear. This essay explores
                wax seals for documents in early modern Europe. The
                reconstructions seek to evaluate the efficacy of the
                author-practitioner’s techniques for producing superior seals.
                The first reconstruction demonstrates that his methods for
                preparing and pressing wax for imprinting can yield a large seal
                that was as well formed as one made using an alternative
                technique involving pouring molten wax. The second
                reconstruction, which explores additives that give a greater
                hardness to wax, produced less conclusive results, in part
                because of uncertainty about how much lead white and how much
                pigment were to be added to a given quantity of wax.</p>

    <p>One of the most widely-used materials in early modern Europe, wax also
        formed an important part of the author-practitioner’s work, and BnF Ms.
        Fr. 640 contains multiple references to it.<a href="#fn1"

        possessed material, spiritual, and intellectual meaning—it was the
        intermediary material par excellence, used for modeling, casting, and
        other processes; it was used for <em>ex voto</em> objects and for other
        sacramentals, such as the many candles employed in religious services;
        and it was viewed as related to the human mind and body, through
        analogies to the soul and its flesh-like malleability (indeed, made
        malleable by human hands) as well as its luminosity when used for
        portraits.<a href="#fn2"

        regarding ways in which the wax might be further embellished after
        having been imprinted, raise questions about the types of “seals” he had
        in mind. This essay explores the kinds of objects that were referred to
        as “seals” in early modern Europe and considers which of these might
        have been of particular interest to the author-practitioner. The related
        reconstructions seek to evaluate the efficacy of the

        seals.</p>
    <h2 id="seals-in-early-modern-europe">Seals in Early Modern Europe</h2>
    <p>Perhaps the most common use of the term “seal” was in reference to the
        imprint of a design and/or lettering in a piece of wax affixed to a
        document or commercial product as evidence of authenticity, origin, and
        quality. Seals were also used as a means of closing letters and other
        missives to ensure privacy, so the recipient could be sure that the
        document had not been opened or tampered with. In what follows, I will
        refer to the wax itself as a seal or a sealing, and to the instrument
        used to imprint the seal as a seal matrix.<a href="#fn3"

           id="fnref3"

        to a short haft to allow the user to exert greater downward pressure on
        the matrix and thus to make a clearer impression in the wax (<i><u>Fig. 1</u></i>). A small matrix might be set into a ring, in which
        case it was known as a signet (<i><u>Fig. 2</u></i>).<a href="#fn4"

    <p>The design and lettering on the face of a seal matrix were engraved into
        flat blanks. Some were custom-made according to the specifications of
        the owner, but others, intended for a less elite market, were engraved
        with generic ornamental designs and well-known mottos.<a href="#fn6"

        accomplished in working with a variety of precious materials and in
        using engraving tools and techniques, were often called upon to fashion
        seal matrices for their wealthy clientele. Typically, craftspeople
        skilled in working with base metals, like pewterers and coppersmiths,
        supplied matrices for those segments of the market that could not afford
        more expensive materials. But, by the mid-thirteenth century in London,
        there was a group of artisans, known as “sealers,” specifically engaged
        in making seal matrices.<a href="#fn7"

    <p>Goldsmiths also produced bronze portrait medals, objects that were
        sometimes referred to as seals. Benvenuto Cellini (1500–1571) devotes
        several chapters in his treatise on goldsmithing to the techniques for
        casting and stamping medals. In describing the process of making cast
        medals for cardinals, Cellini refers to them as <em>suggelli</em>.<a

           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/42r/f/42r/tl"><u>42r</u></a>,
        the author-practitioner refers to “large wax seals” (<em>les grands
            seaulx de cire</em>). This is the only instance in the manuscript in
        which he uses <em>seaulx</em> rather than <em>cachets</em>, and its
        singularity might be taken to imply that he had something quite specific
        in mind, and perhaps something other than a documentary seal.<a
           href="#fn9"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref9"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> Moreover, at the end of the
        recipe, he offers suggestions regarding ways in which the wax might be
        embellished after having been imprinted: carving, gilding, and painting
        the figures; transferring the imprinted wax to a painted glass support;
        or even inlaying the piece in some type of framework.<a href="#fn10"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref10"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> Although some very important
        documentary seals may have been gilded, any change to the physical form

           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref11"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> It seems unlikely, then, that
        these suggestions were intended to apply to ordinary documentary seals.
        Nevertheless, the very specificity of the suggestions points toward a
        particular objective, one with which the author-practitioner’s readers
        would presumably have been familiar.</p>
    <p>Molded and modeled beeswax was used in myriad ways in early modern
        Europe, and the making of several types of wax objects other than seals
        undoubtedly involved one or more of the processes referred to in the
        author-practitioner’s suggestions in the entry on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/42r/f/42r/tl"><u>42r</u></a>.
        Nevertheless, research reveals no other wax objects that were also
        referred to as “seals” and no such objects for which all of the
        techniques mentioned in the entries would have been applicable. Without
        better information about what types of objects might have been captured
        under the rubric of “seal,” it seemed prudent to assume that the terms
        <em>cachet</em> and <em>sceau</em> both referred to documentary seals.
        In view of this, the reconstructions described below were undertaken to
        attempt to determine whether the author-practitioner’s recipes would
        result in superior documentary wax seals.</p>

        Reconstruction of “large wax seals” from “Wax for seal and imprint” on
        fol. 42r </h2>
    <p>I undertook a reconstruction of the recipe on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/42r/f/42r/tl"><u>42r</u></a>
        to test whether the author-practitioner’s instructions to knead wax and
        “to polish it” into a mold with a pestle could produce a better imprint,
        as he asserts, than could be made by pouring molten wax into a mold.<a
           href="#fn12"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref12"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> The recipe divides the process
        of making “large wax seals” into three stages: preparation, imprinting,
        and embellishing. The steps in the preparatory phase—immersing the wax
        in warm water and kneading it by hand—are both designed to raise the
        temperature of the wax by a few degrees<a href="#fn13"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref13"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> to improve its malleability
        prior to imprinting because it is quite inflexible at room
        temperature.<a href="#fn14"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref14"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> For the middle stage, the
        author-practitioner describes a technique which he likens to “polishing”
        the underside of the wax and which seems designed to optimize the
        clarity of the imprint. The final stage of the recipe offers suggestions
        for enhancing and mounting the seal, which I did not follow.</p>
    <p>The preparatory phase began with selecting and preparing the wax. I chose
        to use raw beeswax purchased from a local beekeeper rather than
        commercial wax pellets, since the former seemed a choice more in keeping
        with the spirit of the reconstruction.<a href="#fn15"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref15"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> I then melted the beeswax and
        divided it into two parts, one to be used in the reconstruction of the
        author-practitioner’s process and the other to be used to test the
        author-practitioner’s assertion that his technique would result in a
        better imprint than using molten wax. Working with half of the cooled
        wax, I attempted to knead it to work out any internal inconsistencies
        which could result in flaws in the imprinted wax.<a href="#fn16"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref16"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> However, kneading the
        room-temperature wax by hand was difficult; although it was relatively
        pliable around the edges where it was thinner and could be bent in half
        both lengthwise and crosswise, it was not malleable. Kneading it on a
        hard surface, using my knuckles and the heel of my hand, proved no more
        successful. After working on the wax for ten to fifteen minutes using
        only my hands to raise its temperature, I concluded that it would be
        necessary to immerse the wax in a pot of tepid water to achieve the
        requisite consistency. When the wax was removed from the water after
        about three minutes, it was still quite hard to manipulate, but it began
        to gradually soften. I continued to knead it for three to five minutes,
        shaping it roughly into a disk.</p>
    <p>According to the recipe, the wax was now ready for imprinting. Not having
        an elaborate seal matrix to hand, my reconstruction was based on a
        humble substitute, a circular cookie mold about 9 cm in diameter. I
        centered the cookie mold over the wax disk and pressed down as hard as I
        could—the handle of the mold helped, but I resorted to using a hammer to
        increase the pressure. The manuscript instructions on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/42r/f/42r/tl"><u>42r</u></a>
        then say, “put three or four pieces of paper on, &amp; with a stick
        <del>you</del> even &amp; round like a pestle, you will roll it as if
        you wanted to polish it.”<a href="#fn17"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref17"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> I interpreted that this
        “polishing” action was intended to force the wax into the nooks and
        crannies of the mold, to ensure that the wax took the shape of the
        matrix, compensating, at least in part, for the fact that warm,
        malleable wax does not flow in the way that molten wax does.
        Accordingly, I inverted the matrix so that its open face was facing
        upward, and I covered the wax with several sheets of newsprint. As I
        moved the pestle over the paper, sometimes pushing the pestle down,
        sometimes forcing it forward in a plowing motion, the sheets of
        newsprint began to take on the shape of the underlying wax, which, in

        first, to test how the addition of lead white to wax at increasingly
        greater proportions might impact its pliability, color, and ability to
        take a crisp imprint, and, second, to see how these same qualities are
        impacted by the further addition of a pigment to thusly prepared wax.
    </p>
    <p>The recipe found on fol. <a

           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/42r/f/42r/tl"><u>42r</u></a>,
        provides instructions regarding the preparation of wax for imprinting.
        In this case, the author-practitioner prescribes the addition of
        powdered lead white to make the wax firmer.<a href="#fn22"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref22"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a> The recipe also calls for “a
        drop of turpentine to bind it,” followed by the addition of pigment.
        Although the title of the recipe refers to imprinting seals, the last
        sentence says, “this is the wax goldsmiths use for modeling,” a
        juxtaposition that seems to imply that wax prepared according to this
        recipe might be used in contexts beyond imprinting seals.</p>
    <p>The hardness of wax seems to have been important to a variety of
        craftspeople. Hugh Plat, the seventeenth-century English recorder of
        craft processes, endorsed the use of firm wax for imprinting seals.
        Speculating that “hard wax” was actually made largely from the gum
        <em>Lacca</em>, Plat noted that he had often made seals using gum
        <em>Lacca</em>. He notes, “I … do find the same to agree with hard wax,
        in the perfect taking of the impression of the seal.”<a href="#fn23"

           role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a> Confirmation of the hardening
        effect of lead white on wax can be found in Jehan le Begue’s

        mixture of wax, finely ground tiles, and ground lead white to a wood
        panel that cannot by other means be made smooth enough for painting,
        offering the assurance that "if you hesitate about mixing white-lead
        with the wax, know that the more you mix with it, the harder it will
        be."<a href="#fn24"

        whether the lead white is added for color, firmness, or both.<a

        would have provided crisper forms and that it would have been preferred
        in situations where there was some risk that the shaped wax could be
        damaged by subsequent processes.</p>
    <p>But not all early modern authorities on the subject of modelling agreed
        that firmer wax was better wax. Vasari (1511–1547), in his discussion of
        the preparation of wax for making maquettes, indicates that the wax
        should be made softer:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>To render it softer a little animal fat and turpentine and black
            pitch are put into the wax, and of these ingredients it is the fat
            that makes it more supple; the turpentine adds tenacity, and the
            pitch gives it the black colour and a certain consistency, so that
            after it has been worked and is left to stand it becomes hard.<a

    </blockquote>
    <p>It seems clear that achieving the optimal consistency for a particular
        application hinges on the proportion of additives, often and especially
        lead white, in a given quantity of wax. Because the author-practitioner
        offers no proportions in the recipe on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/133r/f/133r/tl"><u>133r</u></a>,
        I made three trials, producing sample mixtures with successively greater
        concentrations of lead white, which I estimate at two, five, and seven
        percent respectively. For each addition of lead white, I also added “a
        drop” of larch turpentine.<a href="#fn27"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref27"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a> After making each sample
        mixture, I poured off small amounts to be used to compare the changes in
        color and malleability manifested as more lead white was added. The raw
        beeswax had a slightly yellowish tinge, which the lead white mellowed to
        a creamy white. In terms of malleability, the raw beeswax was the most
        supple, and the first and second trial samples were marginally less so.
        The third trial sample could still be manipulated, but it offered a bit
        more resistance to attempts to fold it, and eventually it snapped in
        half. Thus, it appears that the addition of lead white does indeed
        increase the hardness of wax in proportion to the amount of lead white
        added (<i><u>Fig. 6</u></i>).</p>

    <p>The second part of my reconstruction, which required the addition of
        pigment to the lead-turpentine-wax, again raised the question of how
        much to add. It seems that the author-practitioner assumed his readers
        would have known how much pigment was needed. Moreover, the correct
        proportion was probably dependent on the specific pigment itself and the
        desired intensity of color. In the recipe for black sulfured wax to be
        used for casting small animals (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/139v/f/139v/tl"><u>139v</u></a>),
        the author-practitioner did provide a proportion, suggesting “half as
        much” ground charcoal be added to the wax to give it color, meaning to
        add half as much charcoal by weight as wax.<a href="#fn28"

        adding color, including a variety of red pigments, to wax. The suggested
        proportions range from 10:1 for alkanet root or safflower to 100:6 for
        dragon’s blood.<a href="#fn29"

        the addition of the powdered red iron oxide, the Sample A (high pigment
        ratio) wax became the color of burnt umber. The color of the Sample B
        (low pigment ratio) wax was slightly less saturated but still quite
        dark. Efforts to try to manipulate both Sample A and Sample B at room
        temperature were unsuccessful: the blocks of cooled mixture quickly
        snapped in two, suggesting that the addition of the powdered pigment had
        increased the hardness of the wax. Interestingly, the core of Sample B
        revealed flecks of lead white, indicating that the additive had not been
        as thoroughly integrated into the mixture as I had thought (<i><u>Fig. 7</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 8</u></i>).</p>

    <p>To better evaluate whether wax to which lead white has been added is
        preferable to raw beeswax for imprinting seals and modelling, I devised
        additional tests. First, I repeated the kneading and “polishing”
        technique described on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/42r/f/42r/tl"><u>42r</u></a>
        using the Sample B pigmented wax.<a href="#fn31"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref31"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a> At room temperature, the
        pigmented wax proved much more difficult to knead by hand than the raw
        beeswax; in fact, I could not knead it at all until it had been warmed
        in a pan of tepid water. After shaping it into a disk, I tried to
        imprint it with the same matrix I used before, but the impression was
        less than half as deep as the impression in the raw beeswax. To get a
        better impression, I returned the marginally-printed wax disk to the
        warm water for several minutes. After the second attempt at warming, the
        impression was equal in depth to the impression in the raw beeswax, with
        the pigmented wax generally conforming to the shape of the matrix (<i><u>Fig. 9</u></i>). The fact that the Sample B pigmented wax had to
        be warmed for a longer period of time was perhaps due to the higher
        density of the material; taking into account both the lead white
        <em>and</em> the iron oxide, I estimate that roughly ten percent of
        Sample B by volume was composed of powdered metallic compounds. From
        these trials, it is clear that imprinting seals with hardened wax is
        more laborious than with pure beeswax, however the hardening may result
        in other desirable qualities, such as durability, that I did not test.

    <p>The experience of modeling the pigmented wax was quite different.
        Expecting the harder red wax to offer more resistance, I started by
        experimenting with the block of Sample A wax, but it, too, yielded quite
        easily to the modeling tools. When I turned to the imprinted Sample B
        wax, I again used the small oval loop to incise lines in three of the
        petals. True to the author-practitioner’s prediction that “the charcoal
        gives color and body to the wax, which would otherwise be transparent
        &amp; the features would not be seen as well” on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/139v/f/139v/tl"><u>139v</u></a>,
        the addition of pigment made the marks of the modeling tools much more
        visible than in raw beeswax (compare Fig. 9 and Fig. 10).</p>
    <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Based on my reconstruction of the recipe for “large wax seals” in “Wax
        for seal and imprint” on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/42r/f/42r/tl"><u>42r</u></a>,
        I was able to conclude that, with respect to the techniques described
        for preparing and imprinting the wax, the author-practitioner knew
        whereof he spoke: warming the wax produced an impression that was as
        good as one produced using melted wax. It seems likely that, with
        practice, an artisan would have been able to master the “polishing”
        technique, giving greater certainty that the wax would conform to the
        shape of the matrix completely.</p>
    <p>The second reconstruction, of the entry “Hard wax for imprinting seals”
        on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/133r/f/133r/tl"><u>133r</u></a>,
        that tested how wax could be hardened with lead white then colored with
        pigment, made clear the importance of adding color to any medium that is
        intended to be given shape and detail, either by molding, modeling, or
        carving. The pale semi-translucence of the raw beeswax reduced the
        visual impact of any surface shaping. The addition of color made surface
        details visible, probably because of the way pigment molecules reflect
        and absorb light. That transformation would have been critical, both to
        the working artisan and to the end-user of the artisan’s products.</p>

                    (sometimes spelled <em>sugello</em> in <em>Due
                        Trattati</em>) is a variant of <em>sigillo</em>, meaning
                    “seal.” See <em>Cambridge Dictionario
                        (Italiano-Inglese/Inglese/Italiano) Signorelli</em>
                    (Milan: Signorelli, 1985), s.v. “<em>suggèllo</em>.” Cellini
                    used the term <em>medaglie</em> when referring to medals. At
                    first blush, the two might appear unrelated—a medal is cast
                    in a mold from molten metal, whereas a seal matrix is
                    engraved in cold metal. But, in order to produce the mold
                    for casting a medal, the artisan had to create a model of
                    the design that, in turn, would be used to create the mold
                    for the medal. Because of their malleability, the materials
                    used most often to create models were clay and wax. Thus, a
                    finished wax model for a medal, made by modelling a
                    malleable material, might look very much like a wax seal,
                    made by pushing a seal matrix down on the same malleable
                    material. The objects that Cellini refers to as “medals” are

                <p>Beeswax for the reconstruction was purchased from Andrew’s
                    Honey, a vendor of honey and wax at the Union Square
                    Greenmarket in New York City. Historically, honey was
                    separated from the wax of the comb by melting entire
                    sections of honey-filled comb; because the wax has a higher
                    density than the honey, the honey sank to the bottom of the
                    vessel in which the comb was being melted, and the wax
                    floated to the top. The introduction of industrial
                    production methods, which sought to preserve as much of the
                    wax comb as possible during the process of extracting the
                    honey, led to the use of wooden and metal frames as the base
                    within which a hive’s bees construct the comb; honey is now
                    harvested by setting individual frames in slots inside a
                    drum that is spun rapidly, causing the honey to be flung out
                    of the frames by centrifugal force. The frames can then be
                    replaced in the hive after the honey is harvested with the
                    wax combs still intact. Typically, the only wax that is
                    harvested by a modern beekeeper is the layer that the bees
                    have laid down to cap cells on the outside of the comb in
                    each frame. It is still necessary to separate the cap wax
                    from any honey that has adhered to the cap by melting.

                    the author-practitioner recommends softening the wax in
                    tepid water to facilitate kneading, though this can
                    introduce further inconsistencies: “mays plustot il la fault
                    bien avoyr pestrie entre les mains pour la rendre bien unie
                    car aultrem{ent} leau qui se mectroit entre deulx
                    lempescheroit de sunir.” (“But before, it should have been
                    kneaded between your hands to render it very even, for
                    otherwise the water that would get in between would prevent
                    it from becoming even.”).<a href="#fnref16"

                <p>This unevenness may have resulted from the imperfectly flat
                    upper surface of the initial wax disk, which was higher in
                    the middle than around the edges. Consequently, the outer
                    edges of some of the “petals” taper off or appear depressed

                <p>Cennini suggests that when casting a “waste mold” you should

                    turpentine was as a thin liquid used as a solvent for
