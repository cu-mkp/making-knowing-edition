        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <div>
            <p>Throughout BnF Ms. Fr. 640, the author-practitioner attempts to
                create black oils, stains, varnishes, pigments and—in one
                recipe—dye. Contextualizing the importance of black in the
                manuscript and in early modern society, this essay explores a
                short black dye recipe on fol. <a
                   href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/38v/f/38v/tl"><u>38v</u></a>
                which uses lead and lye made from quicklime. It then follows the
                author-practitioner’s instruction to “try other colors with the
                lye made of lime.” The essay proposes that while this method of
                dyeing degrades the fibers of wool and hair (and does not work
                on linens or silks), there is a “material logic” to the
                author-practitioner’s choice of materials if we place this
                recipe in context with his other experiments. While there is no
                substantial discussion of textiles or dyeing in Ms. Fr. 640,
                textiles make frequent occurrences in recipes as objects of
                transformation (either to be dyed, or to be used as a source for
                pigments), as subjects for painters, as tools, as similes, and
                as the object of useful knowledge. This essay argues that the
                author-practitioner demonstrates his “textile literacy”
                throughout the manuscript, including notes on the expense of
                black textiles, the accounting practices of cloth merchants, and
                the visual effects of clothing. Given the importance of the woad
                industry in Toulouse and the economic and cultural value of
                textiles in the early modern period, such knowledge and interest
                is understandable, but this essay prompts further questions
                about how widespread dye experimentation was in this period, the
                nuanced meaning of color in the region, and even what the
                author-practitioner might have been wearing as he carried out
                his experiments.</p>

        640</h2>
    <p>“Black colour for dyeing” is not the only recipe in BnF Ms. Fr. 640 that
        aims to make black. On fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/46v/f/46v/tl"><u>46v</u></a>,
        the author-practitioner mentions that shoemakers use “oil of sulfur” to
        paint “a reddish color” on black leather shoes, and gives a recipe for
        using this “oil of sulfur” to make “writing without ink” that will turn
        black when heated, and can be used to paint “on stone, black letters.”<a

        throughout the manuscript, appearing in recipes for oils, stains,
        varnishes, pigments and—in one case—as a dye.</p>
    <p>The author-practitioner understood the complexity of making black. In his
        instructions for painting “Shadows” he explains, “blacks make different
        colors, some a reddish black, others tending towards blue, and others
        towards green, choose those which tend towards yellow.”<a href="#fn5"

           role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> This problem was even more
        fraught for dyers. Painters could use charcoal or soot to reproduce
        “true blacks” (rather than using a combination of blue, red and yellow
        to make black) but before the introduction of logwood in the late
        sixteenth century, and its mastery by Europeans in the seventeenth- and
        eighteenth-centuries, pure black textiles were an elusive fantasy for
        European makers and consumers.<a href="#fn6"

           id="fnref6"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
    <p>A number of historians and sociologists have highlighted the nuanced
        significance and widespread importance of black textiles for use in
        clothing for various cultures, religious groups, and genders from the
        ancient world to the present.<a href="#fn7"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref7"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> While the author-practitioner
        does not explicitly state the cultural importance of black textiles as
        being anything more than related to economics, colorfast and deep black
        fabrics would have been highly sought-after commodities in his
        community—amongst artisans as well as members of the court. It is
        possible to get a sense of the value of well-dyed black textiles, and
        the social status suggested by those who can afford to wear them, when
        he notes in an entry on silk, “black is less abundant [for the worker]
        because it charges much.”<a href="#fn8"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref8"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> He also notes that black cloth is
        made thin “so that the dyeing is inexpensive.”<a href="#fn9"

           role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
    <p>The one recipe for black dye, that is probably intended for use with
        textiles, is at the head of fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/38v/f/38v/tl"><u>38v</u></a>.
        It follows a seemingly unrelated set of recipes on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/38r/f/38r/tl"><u>38r</u></a>
        for sapphire, counterfeit saffron, and amber. It is just two sentences,
        which appear to be in one hand, neatly written in one sitting. But from
        the tone of the last sentence, the author-practitioner did not finish
        his work on this recipe. While he confidently states “Take lye of
        quicklime &amp; litharge, mix &amp; soak, &amp; you will make a tawny
        dye, &amp; by reiterating it you will make black,” the second sentence
        is open-ended, adding to our sense that although this is a fair copy
        manuscript, the author-practitioner was still in the midst of working
        through new ideas and experiments during its compilation: “Try other
        colors with lye of lime.”</p>
    <p>Given the importance of black textiles in this period, but an absence of
        any indication in the recipe as to the substance to be dyed, the first
        question that this entry raises is what is being dyed black in this
        recipe?<a href="#fn10"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref10"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> That black dye was elusive in
        the period raises a second question: is this dye recipe successful? In
        investigating these questions, this essay will also explore the role of
        textiles for the author-practitioner in Ms. Fr. 640.</p>
    <h2 id="textiles-in-ms.-fr.-640">Textiles in Ms. Fr. 640</h2>
    <p>While there is no substantial discussion of textiles or dyeing in Ms. Fr.
        640, textiles make frequent occurrences in recipes as objects of
        transformation (either to be dyed, or to be used as a source for
        pigments) as subjects for painters, as tools, as similes, and as the
        object of useful or interesting knowledge.</p>
    <p>The author-practitioner is keen to stress the importance of material and
        visual familiarity with textiles for painters. When he offers
        instruction as to how to paint “Folds in clothing” on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/59v/f/59v/tl"><u>59v</u></a>,
        he states “take care that none are made false,” so the painter should
        ensure “only that which the natural can do is imitated.”<a href="#fn11"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref11"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> He contrasts the supple crêpes,
        taffetas and silks to “thick cloth” fabrics, which have hardly any
        folds. Similar attention to the movement, texture, and light of textiles
        for painters is clear in the author-practitioner’s instructions for
        “Velvets and blacks” on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/63v/f/63v/tl"><u>63v</u></a>.<a
           href="#fn12"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref12"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> Here, the painter is instructed
        to layer the pigment on thick, and add highlights in white, or to use
        “peach pit black, which is very black” to shade in blue and green
        velvets. Textile literacy is expected of his reader when, in a
        discussion of “Molds [...] for delicate things” on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/107v/f/107v/tl"><u>107v</u></a>,
        the author-practitioner explains that “Good feather alum is white and as
        lustrous as white silk.<a href="#fn13"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref13"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
    <p>Textiles also interest the author-practitioner for their economic value.
        On the same page as the black dye recipe, two entries suggest that the
        author-practitioner has been in conversation with local cloth merchants,
        and is interested not only in the cost of fine velvets, woad, and woolen
        cloth (dyed and undyed), but also in the accounting practices
        (double-entry or single-entry) of cloth and dye merchants who sell such
        textiles and dyestuffs.<a href="#fn14"

           id="fnref14"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> The importance of woad dyeing to

           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/39r/f/39r/tl"><u>39r</u></a>).
        Woad or pastel was brought to Toulouse for the rather pungent
        fermentation and extraction process, but the industry began to decline
        after the 1560s as indigo became increasingly available in Europe.<a

        interested in the cultivation of silkworms, which was a tricky but

        gripped the attention of nobles, artisans and publishers alike in the
        late-sixteenth and early-seventeenth century (fols. <a

           role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
    <p>The author-practitioner suggests other dye recipes using laque,
        vert-de-gris, azur, pastel, alum, brazil wood, copperas, dragon’s blood,
        crimson, woad, cochineal, and dyes from flowers (fols. <a

        He also connects dye to painting and cosmetics when he notes that
        “Florence lake is better than the kind from Flanders for in Florence the
        best dyes are made [...] That is why ladies, wanting to color their
        cheeks, ground Florence lake very finely, then fill a little cotton with
        it, which they next wrap in a little fabric of Cambray which is clear.
        And thus they pounce the lake on their cheeks &amp; then, with another
        clean cotton, they soften it.” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/58r/f/58r/tl"><u>58r</u></a>).
        The author-practitioner’s discussion of textiles and dyes in the
        manuscript connects to ideas about beauty, fashion, economics, and
        industry, and gestures towards the social, cultural and economic role
        that colourful fabrics played in early modern Europe.</p>
    <h2 id="reconstructing-the-recipe">Reconstructing the Recipe</h2>
    <p>The recipe for black dye is comprised of one sentence of confident
        instruction (“Take lye of quicklime &amp; litharge, mix &amp; soak,
        &amp; you will make a tawny dye, &amp; by reiterating it you will make
        black”) followed by a second sentence suggesting further experiment
        (“Try other colors with lye of lime”). The limited information given—no
        quantities, no proportions, no timing, no substance or material to be
        dyed—made for a difficult start. First, it was necessary to work out
        what was meant by “lye of quicklime.” I dismissed the idea that this was
        lye made from a combination of quicklime and litharge as these are the
        only two substances listed in the recipe—if the lye was made from a
        combination of quicklime and litharge, then there would be no additional
        substance to “mix” with. Lye does appear elsewhere in the manuscript,
        three times with no indication of a recipe (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/38r/f/38r/tl"><u>38r</u></a>—for

        your molded work in it.” This is the most common method for making lye,
        both in the early modern period and for modern soap- and dye-making, and

        author-practitioner would use quicklime for lye. When I discovered that
        quicklime had already been made in the lab by calcining oyster shells, I
        realized that it made material sense for the author/practitioner to
        experiment with materials that he was already working with in the

        growing rich from the production and sale of woad, and has close contact
        with a number of cloth- and woad-merchants, it would be reasonable for
        him to experiment with materials at hand that might offer new and
        successful methods for dyeing—whether black or, as the second sentence

        the material is. I decided to experiment with white lead, red lead and

        modern texts.<a href="#fn25"

    <p>In the absence of quantities in the recipe, I decided to start with a
        ratio of 100 ml of lye to 1g of white lead/red lead/yellow lead and
        resolved to alter the quantities in further recipes, if needed. I hoped
        to see instant color change in the liquid, but other than a change in
        the white lead/lye mix to a pale pink/brown color, there was no
        indication that any of these mixes would make a black dye (<i><u>Fig. 4</u></i>). Having made control pots of white lead/water, red
        lead/water and yellow lead/water, I was able to compare the influence of
        the lye in the mix, but there was very little color difference between
        sample and control in the yellow- and red lead lye mixes. The white
        lead/water control, however, was not the same pinkish-brown tone as the
        lye mix—it remained white. I left samples of white lead/lye, red
        lead/lye and yellow lead/lye uncovered, in the fume hood, in case oxygen
        was required to change the mixture to a dark brown or black, but after
        two days, the only notable color change was of the white lead/lye mix to
        a pinkish-brown hue (<i><u>Fig. 5</u></i>).</p>

    <p>Given the predominance of woolen textiles in Europe in the sixteenth
        century, I began with the assumption that this recipe was for woolen
        cloth. While linen was ubiquitous—worn by men and women, old and young,
        rich and poor next to the skin (as undershirts, collars and cuffs), it
        was valued for its whiteness, and ease of cleaning and bleaching and
        would have rarely been dyed. If the author-practitioner was dyeing silk,
        linen or (unlikely) cotton, this would probably be unusual enough to
        merit mention in the body of the recipe. Nevertheless, I thought it was
        worth testing on the textiles available in the lab: silk, linen and
        cotton. I decided to start testing the dye on textiles and fibers with
        the white lead/lye mix, as it was the most promising in terms of color
        change. Having applied it with a pipette to small squares of silk,
        cotton and linen, held in plastic tubs, I decided to try it on my own
        hair (as wool was not available in the lab) (<i><u>Fig. 6</u></i> and
        <i><u>Fig.7</u></i>). The linen turned brown-black after about five
        minutes, as did the hair (which was originally a blonde/red color),
        while the silk and cotton just took on the pinkish-brown of the solution
        (<i><u>Fig. 8</u></i>). I then reapplied or, in the words of the recipe
        “reiterat[ed] it” to ensure that the dye was not brown but black. Two
        days later, the linen had changed from its original grey brown, via
        black upon immediate white lead/lye dyeing, to a bright powdery white (<i><u>Fig. 9</u></i>). The hair remained black (<i><u>Fig. 10</u></i>).
        The dye seemed to be only working on hair so far.</p>

    <p>Encouraged by the success of the hair dye, and in the knowledge that hair
        and wool are similarly composed of keratin, I sourced some 100% pure
        undyed wool, and scoured it with water and dishwashing soap to remove
        oils and grease (a necessary step when dyeing wool). Once the wool was
        dry, I cut small pieces of yarn and tested white lead/lye, red lead/lye
        and yellow lead/lye solutions (and also tested with a control of lye by
        itself) (<i><u>Fig. 11</u></i>). All three lead/lye solutions turned the
        wool dark brown after about 15 minutes of soaking (<i><u>Fig. 12</u></i>, <i><u>Fig.13</u></i>, and <i><u>Fig.14</u></i>). I then “reiterat[ed]”
        the application of lead/lye mix, and after another 15 minutes, the wool
        fibers were all dark brown/black.</p>

    <p>Having left the successfully dyed black wool in the lab over the weekend,
        I discovered upon return on Monday that the wool had completely
        disintegrated, leaving behind some shiny thick black sludge (<i><u>Fig. 15</u></i>). To see whether it was possible to dye wool without
        this subsequent disintegration, I repeated the dye process with white
        lead/lye, red lead/lye and yellow lead/lye solutions, dyeing two pieces
        of wool black with each of the three mixes. For each lead/lye mix, I
        took one sample of wool and then removed it from the dye pot, placed it
        into a fresh pot, and left for two days. I washed the other three wool
        samples in water, using three pots and dipping and swirling the woollen
        yarn in each pot (the water turned the color of the lead/lye solution in
        the first pot, paler in the second dip, and hardly changed by the third
        submersion). I then placed the washed wool into a clean pot and left for
        two days. The three woolen samples that had been dyed and then just
        removed from the lead/lye mixes had all disintegrated into black sludge.
        However the wool removed from the lead/lye mixes and then washed in
        water retained the black color and had not dissolved (<i><u>Fig. 16</u></i>).</p>

    <p>There are similar recipes for black dye, both for hair and wool, which
        are contemporary to, or pre-date, Ms. Fr. 640. In the 1548
        <em>Plictho</em> of Giovanventura Rosetti there is a recipe for “Very
        beautiful black” with the instructions: “Measure litharge well powdered
        on the marble, live lime not spent, and put it in common water in
        proportion and it makes very beautiful black. Also, golden litharge,
        very strong lye, and make boild what you want inside and it will be
        black. Also silvery litharge one third, and live lime 2 pounds and make
        the water boil and it will be a very fine black.”<a href="#fn26"

        Fioravanti explained that this recipe worked because litharge is a

    <h2 id="try-other-colors-with-lye-of-lime">“Try other colors with lye of
        lime”</h2>
    <p>While the author-practitioner’s knowledge of the quicklime lye and lead
        black dye recipe places him in a long tradition reaching back to the
        ancient world and forward into present day laboratories, his second
        sentence “Try other colors with lye of lime” is more explorative.
        Perhaps, following the success of the lead and lime mix in creating
        black, the author-practitioner sought to experiment with other colors to
        see if his quicklime lye would produce successful or surprising results.
        As it was unclear which substances or dyes “other colors” meant in this
        context, I decided to follow his instruction to “try other colors” using
        dyestuffs mentioned on the same folio as this recipe. Immediately
        following the black dye entry is a recipe “Against nose bleed and for
        dyeing” which suggests “sorrel or lapathum acutum of the sort that is
        red-veined, which is called dragon’s blood” that is “a strong dye” which
        “makes beautiful violet.” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/38v/f/38v/tl"><u>38v</u></a>).
        At the base of this page, an entry on “Scarlets,” explains how much an
        aulne (a measure) costs to dye.<a href="#fn39"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref39"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>39</sup></a> The author-practitioner explains
        “whoever wants something beautiful should buy white cloth worth fifteen
        francs an aulne &amp; have it dyed with pure scarlet pastel woad &amp; a
        little cochineal” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/38v/f/38v/tl"><u>38v</u></a>).
        He then states, “Black cloth is thin so that the dyeing is inexpensive,”
        perhaps referring to the black dye recipe using lead and quicklime lye
        above. Given that cochineal, woad, and dragon’s blood are dyestuffs
        referenced on the same page, and are substances that we already had in
        the laboratory for use with other recipes, there seemed to be both
        material and textual logic for experimenting with these colors “with lye
        of lime.” Therefore I followed the same procedure as with the lead/lime
        mix, mixing 100 ml of lye to one gram of dyestuff of woad (purchased
        already powdered), cochineal (one sample ground in a mortar and one not
        ground) and dragon’s blood (one sample ground in a mortar and one not
        ground). The woad, a mid-blue powder, turned deep green when mixed with
        lye. The ground and unground cochineals transformed from deep red into
        deep purple. The dragon’s blood samples both changed from a bright
        orange-red to a brown-red in lye. The unground sample of dragon’s blood
        in lye was a darker red—almost a brown red—than the sample I had ground
        in a mortar (<i><u>Fig. 17</u></i>). I dyed a piece of unwashed and
        undyed wool with each of the five colour/lye mixes, by covering them in
        the dye solutions and leaving for about 10 minutes, and then
        “reiterating” with a second submersion in dye solution. Following the
        experience of the black dyed wool dissolving after being dyed, and
        seeing that it was necessary to wash the dyed wool in three baths of
        water, I dipped each sample into three pots of water to remove excess
        lye. While the wool with black dye had survived this process intact,
        which had preserved the wool and not removed the black color, these
        samples all but dissolved in the water during this dye process. While
        the dyed samples left over after the washing process were beautiful and
        bright colors—the cochineal had dyed the wool a vibrant purple (<i><u>Fig. 18</u></i>), the dragon’s blood a bright orange (<i><u>Fig. 19</u></i>), and the woad dye a rich moss green (<i><u>Fig. 20</u></i>)—the wool had deteriorated into a gelatinous sludge.
        Cochineal, woad, and dragon’s blood were all used as dyestuffs in the
        early modern period, but the processes used were more complex than
        simply combining with a lye. Rather, they usually required boiling,
        submersion in vats, and a mordant to release and fix the dye color.<a
           href="#fn40"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref40"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>40</sup></a> It seems here that although the
        alkaline lye transformed the dyestuff hues into attractive colors, the
        lye mix dissolved the wool even more quickly than in the black dye
        experiment. While this might have been because the wool was left in the
        dye for too long, and perhaps a shorter “dip” into the dye might have
        been better, it seems unlikely that this means of dyeing would be
        effective without damaging the wool irreparably.</p>

    <h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
    <p>Following the reconstruction, and with reference to ancient, early
        modern, and modern recipes, it seems probable that this recipe was to
        dye wool black. However, it is possible that the recipe was also known
        to the author-practitioner as a hair dye, and this might explain the
        reference in another dye recipe to animal hair (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/13r/f/13r/tl"><u>13r</u></a>),
        and to another entry that gives instructions for removing hair on the
        forehead (fol. <a

        on animals, perhaps it could be connected to instructions in the

    </p>
    <p>His “textile literacy”—understanding the many uses of textile fibers, the
        methods cloth- and woad-merchants used for accounting, and the visual
        familiarity with different cloth folds—was not unusual in the early
        modern period when every individual would have had a close relationship
        with the clothing that they wore and maintained. Textiles consumed a far
        greater proportion of income and time than in the post-industrial age,
        and few clothes were available to purchase ready-made. Early modern men
        and women would have had to select, handle and negotiate for the fabrics
        and fastenings required in each garment, discuss styles and shapes with
        their tailors and seamstresses, and have clothing pinned and fitted onto
        their body.<a href="#fn46"

                    it what he would like on shoes, boots, and colets. And he
                    will obtain a reddish color which will not disappear by any

                    Recipe for putting all woods in color
                    <br>
                    For making it black, one needs to soak it in olive oil, and
                    similarly in the case of horn, four or five days, &amp; then
                    boil it where it has soaked for the space of one hour, &amp;
                    take it out of the oil, and take some natural sulfur or
                    another if you cannot find it, and cover the said wood with
                    this powder, until it is cool, &amp; you will make it boil
                    again, &amp; boiling it, one will see if it is black enough
                    or not. If it is not enough, you take the said powder &amp;
                    put it on the said wood while boiling.<a href="#fnref2"

                    Black varnish for sword guard, bands for trunks, &amp;c.
                    <br>
                    Take linseed oil or more cheaply, walnut oil, and rid it of
                    grease with garlic &amp; hog’s fennel, some also add bread
                    crusts, which you will boil in it for a good quarter of an
                    hour. Next, put in one lb of the oil thus boiled the size of
                    a walnut of black pitch &amp; a double handful of grains of
                    wheat, without removing the garlic &amp; onions, and let it
                    boil together for a good quarter of an hour. And when the
                    pitch is well melted &amp; when the oil has body, you can
                    remove it from the fire. Then, to varnish, place your iron
                    over a low charcoal fire &amp; apply your varnish with a
                    feather or a brush. And when you see that it no longer
                    smokes, it is done and your varnish is dry. For excellent
                    black varnish, add two or three paternoster beads of jet
                    among the rest. Some consider walnut oil better.
                    <br>
                    If there is a lot of varnish, it needs to boil for at least
                    half a day, for it is better the more it boils. It is
                    dangerous if it catches fire, if it goes over the top, and
                    is hard to extinguish. Make this therefore in a courtyard or
                    an open space. In five or six lb of oil, one must put one lb
                    of galipot, which costs 4 sous, &amp; some peeled garlic
                    cloves. This varnish in and of itself is not black, but it
                    blackens over the fire. See below, around the 3rd part of
                    this book, after sands, in the chapter on furbishers.

                    Shadows
                    <br>
                    Because blacks make different colors, some a reddish black,
                    others tending towards blue, and others towards green,
                    choose those which tend towards yellow to make beautiful
                    shadows in oil, for shadow, especially that of men, is
                    yellowish. And for this effect use very strongly ground jet,
                    which you will mix with a little yellow ocher &amp; lead
                    white. Or else, after you have ground your lead white bro
                    and clean p gathered it with the [gap], grind the jet into
                    it. Thus it will be more desiccative, &amp; making on its
                    own a yellowish black. A little white mixed in renders it
                    perfect for men’s shadows. Blacks which make a greenish
                    black are appropriate for women’s shadows. Take, then, some
                    black of [gap], a little sap-green &amp; bistre, &amp; you
                    will have a perfect shadow for women in distemper.<a

                <p>“Charger” is translated by Cotgrave as both “to load” and “to
                    bestow a charge on.” As a noun, “charge” also can mean a
                    “cause of extraordinarie expence.” Therefore this entry
                    could be indicating either how much dyestuff has to be used
                    to achieve a black silk, or to the price of the dyed
                    textile, and of course the amount of dyestuff did influence
                    the price of the silk. See “<em>charge</em>” and

                    Crimson is more abundant than all other silks because its

                    through it. It is this, with its small soft &amp; thin

                    Because one aulne costs seven or eight lb. to dye, they use
                    cloths worth seven or eight francs an aulne. But whoever
