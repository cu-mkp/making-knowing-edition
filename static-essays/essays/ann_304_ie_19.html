<h4 id="tianna-helena-uchacz">Tianna Helena Uchacz</h4>
<p>This essay begins from a premise: the places we live and work—what we
keep in them, what we do in them, and how we describe them—can tell us
something important about our professional lives, communities, and modes
of understanding the world.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> This may seem an unusual
point of entry into BnF Ms. Fr. 640 and the world of its
author-practitioner, who rarely describes the spaces he works in or
moves through; his focus is almost exclusively on activities of making.
Nevertheless, his making, as well as the sourcing of the materials and
knowledge that supports it, is always a situated practice. Spaces,
places, and their material and conceptual contours support the
author-practitioner’s activities. This essay attempts to reconstruct
something of the author-practitioner’s workshop, his itineraries in and
beyond Toulouse, and his assumptions about environments of creative
labor.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="the-workshop">The Workshop</h2>
<p>Reading Ms. Fr. 640 can conjure up the image of a curious,
experimental, and at times intently focused man iterating and
improvising in a workshop arrayed with all manner of tools, materials,
and works in progress. The manuscript’s recipes, observations, and
advice relate to a wide range of craft practices from metalworking,
painting, and glassmaking to dyeing, cultivation, and medicine, while
its descriptions of technical processes are unusually specific and
sometimes even first-hand. As the text jumps from topic to topic,
third-person description to first-person narration, and general
observation to minutely detailed instruction, a reader can easily
conflate the author-practitioner’s interests with his expertise.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> This section of the essay will try
to disentangle the tools and materials that the author-practitioner used
himself—and thus that constituted his workshop—from the plethora of
substances, goods, and equipment invoked across the manuscript’s
folios.</p>
<p>To be clear: the author-practitioner makes little explicit mention of
his own working space, its layout, or the extent of its inventory. Of
note, however, is a very short passage that is richly suggestive. On
fol. <a href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/12v/f/12v/tl"><u>12v</u></a>,
the author-practitioner describes his experience calcining the surface
of a carnelian stone: “I experimented,” he writes “[...] on the fire of
my goldsmith’s forge [<em>ma forge dorfevre</em>].”<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> A
forge was a major installation.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> It would have dominated
a workshop space and circumscribed a set of activities that could take
place therein, including the use of smaller furnaces set inside it. It
was also a fitting piece of equipment for an artisan preoccupied with
the transformation of materials using fire, from the making of varnish,
imitation gemstones, and the preservation of small animals through
desiccation on the one hand to mold making and fine metal casting on the
other. Indeed, the ability to mold and cast small works was a
fundamental branch of the goldsmith’s art, discussed by both the
sculptor Benvenuto Cellini (1500–1571) in <em>I Trattati
dell’Oreficeria</em> (1568) and the metallurgist Vannoccio Biringuccio
(ca. 1480–ca. 1539) in the <em>Pirotechnia</em> (1540).<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a>
Indeed, when the hundreds of casting entries in Ms. Fr. 640 are
considered alongside the sizable corpus of recipes for counterfeiting,
polishing, and inlaying gemstones, the author-practitioner’s brief
phrase, “my goldsmith’s forge” seems to hold promise for our
understanding of the author-practitioner’s training and work.</p>
<p>Possessing a goldsmith’s forge, however, was not necessarily the same
thing as being a goldsmith, and there are problems with identifying the
author-practitioner as a goldsmith <em>tout court</em>. His range of
interests was broad, and while he may not have had first-hand experience
of all the craft processes he compiled, his expertise was not confined
to the goldsmith’s craft. Moreover, he himself complicates matters on
fol. <a href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/121v/f/121v/tl"><u>121v</u></a>
when he writes “if the goldsmiths&nbsp;knew&nbsp;[<del>knew</del>]&nbsp;the substance
to make&nbsp;silver&nbsp;run in their works, they would buy much of it,” implying
a certain distance between his own practice and that of goldsmiths in
general. Moreover, as Michèle Bimbenet-Privat notes, the
author-practitioner makes no reference in the manuscript to the many
legal obligations that accompanied this highly regulated trade.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> What was, then, his relationship to
the trade? If not a goldsmith, might we better consider him a
practitioner of “the small art of casting,” as the metallurgist
Biringuccio called the work of mold-making in frames using powders and
sands?<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> Or was the author-practitioner a
different kind of artisan altogether? Was he, like his Toulouse
contemporary Raymond Masse, trained as a goldsmith but working with
other craftspeople and prominent patrons, perhaps unbounded by guild
regulations and even economic need?<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> As we will see next, a
comparison between the author-practitioner’s workshop contents and those
of other goldsmiths suggests that the situation is, indeed, rather
complicated.</p>
<h3 id="the-author-practitioners-materials-and-tools">The
Author-Practitioner’s Materials and Tools</h3>
<p>In order to distinguish the author-practitioner’s own tools and
materials from the several hundred he invokes across the manuscript—and
to thereby reconstruct his working conditions with greater certainty—we
can look to his use of first-person pronouns.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a>
In general, the entries of Ms. Fr. 640 were written using a combination
of third-person descriptions (e.g., <em>ilz font</em>, <em>aulcuns
prennent</em>), impersonal constructions (e.g., <em>il fault</em>),
imperatives (e.g., <em>faictes bouillir</em>, <em>broye le</em>), or
statements directed at either indefinite subjects (<em>on y mesles</em>,
<em>on faict</em>) or undefined addressees (<em>tu pourras</em>, <em>tu
y mectras</em>).<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> We find first-person pronouns,
whether personal, reflexive, or possessive, used somewhat rarely—they
appear in only seventy-five of the nearly one thousand entries in the
manuscript. These seventy-five predominantly address techniques of
casting (forty-five entries) but also discuss gemstones (eight),
painting (six), and medicine (two).<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> A third of the entries
that feature first-person pronouns seem to relate either the
author-practitioner’s own observations about the practices of founders,
gunpowder makers, painters, goldsmiths, master life-casters, and
peddlers (e.g., <em>ainsy l’ay je veu employer</em>, <em>j'ay veu
que</em>, <em>en ma presence</em>, etc.) or his speculations about
potential improvements to processes he is otherwise describing
impersonally (e.g., <em>je croy(s)</em>, <em>je cuide</em>, <em>j’ay
opinion</em>, <em>a mon advis</em>, etc.).</p>
<p>Most helpfully, forty-four entries appear to relate his personal,
hands-on experience with specific tools and materials.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a>
Even here, his use of first-person pronouns is often restricted to short
passages embedded within larger impersonally constructed entries; as a
result, we cannot take for granted that the author-practitioner had
first-hand experience of all materials, tools, or processes mentioned in
those full entries.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> The most conservative
interpretation, drawing only on those passages in which first-person
pronouns describe first-hand experience, provides us with the following
glimpse of his inventory.</p>
<p>The author-practitioner’s personal material inventory reflects his
overwhelming first-person engagement with casting and the more
specialized tasks of mold-making, lifecasting, and metal and alloy
preparation. Thus, for mold-making, he uses various kinds of clay
earths, sands, minerals, and salts<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> as well as finely
pestled materials,<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> calcined materials,<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a>
and smokes.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> His experiments, especially his
lifecasting, bring him into contact with plants and animals of greater
and lesser specificity.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a> He uses luting materials,<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> waters and solvents,<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a>
binders and fats,<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a> various resinous products,<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a> and wax. He also makes use of
mineral pigments,<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24" role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a> semi-precious stones,<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25" role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a> and tripoli to polish.</p>
<p>Finally, there are the metals. He uses gold leaf and silver of
various kinds<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26" role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a> as well as varieties of copper.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27" role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a> He reports using mercury, tin, and
lead, often noting the purity and fineness of the last two. Yet he was
most interested in alloys, whether those he acquired ready-made<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a> or the lead-tin alloy he was
continually and carefully adjusting for the purposes of finely detailed
casting and lifecasting in particular.</p>
<p>In addition to housing a goldsmith’s forge, the author-practitioner’s
workshop appears to have accommodated other furnaces (c.f., “<em>mon
fourneau</em>,” on fol. <a href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/86v/f/86v/tl"><u>86v</u></a>),
including a <em>four à vent</em>, which he uses on fol.&nbsp;<a href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/132v/f/132v/tl"><u>132v</u></a>.
His own fire-based work relied largely on charcoal as a fuel.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29" role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a> Perhaps Etienne Delaune’s 1576
engraving of a goldsmith’s workshop, in which a young man attends a
furnace constructed with firebricks set within a larger forge can give a
clue to how these various heating elements might have coexisted in the
same space (<i><u>Fig.
1</u></i>).<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30" role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a> Moreover, he reports having
adjusted his furnace with tiles when making imitation rubies, raising it
“two tiles all around” (fol. <a href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/100v/f/100v/tl"><u>100v</u></a>)
from the charcoal fire so as to create greater heat and covering the
crucible itself with a tile “in order that heat reverberates better
there” (fol. <a href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/101r/f/101r/tl"><u>101r</u></a>).
The author-practitioner also reports having used casting equipment, such
as crucibles, iron caskets and trivets, mold frames, and even a press
for molds. In fact, the author-practitioner even illustrates a press for
large molds on fol. <a href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/160r/f/160r/tl"><u>160r</u></a>
(<i><u>Fig.
2</u></i>). While it is unclear if his own press was of this kind, he
notes that presses could be heavy to move near the&nbsp;forge&nbsp;for casting.
Such repositioning might have been easier with the help of an assistant.
Though the author-practitioner advises using the help of a
<em>garson</em> (workshop boy) elsewhere in the manuscript (fols. <a href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/123v/f/123v/tl"><u>123v</u></a>,
<a href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/135v/f/135v/tl"><u>135v</u></a>),
it is unclear if he took this advice himself. Additionally, the workshop
would have housed at least one large working surface or more. The
author-practitioner mentions constructing a mold on a very clean and
smooth table (fol. <a href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/84v/f/84v/tl"><u>84v</u></a>),
a requisite for his precision work. We can begin to imagine a workshop
space large enough to accommodate a forge, various furnaces, a somewhat
sizable press that could be moved about, and perhaps room for an
assistant to work alongside the author-practitioner at a large
table.</p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/staging061825-0/images/ann_304_ie_19/1TO-_eBRwOnWE3W5V0FwzHlmeHrNKWhox.jpg" alt="fig. 1"><figcaption>Fig. 1. Étienne Delaune (1518/1519–1583), <em>A Goldsmith’s

<p>The workshop also included a range of tools, some acquired on spec
from other craftspeople but others bespoke or made by his own hand to
accommodate particular needs. Accordingly, the author-practitioner
possessed some tools in multiple varieties and materials, such as his
grinding surfaces,<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31" role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a> pestles and mortars,<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32" role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a>
tools for sifting,<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33" role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a> vessels,<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34" role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a>
brushes,<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35" role="doc-noteref"><sup>35</sup></a> and candles.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36" role="doc-noteref"><sup>36</sup></a>
He also reports using a lead wheel for polishing, a diamond point,
glassworkers’ solder, iron wire, a silver spoon, linen cloths, napkins,
a sponge, knives, (tallow) candles, and even a birdcage.</p>
<p>The preceding is but a very conservative list of materials and tools
that can be securely linked to the author-practitioner through his
first-person reports of use, which are comparatively few. Most
certainly, the workshop also housed a much larger range of items.
Indeed, as stocked and equipped as his workshop appears to have been,
the extent of this inventory pales in comparison with the hundreds of
additional materials and tools mentioned across the manuscript.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37" role="doc-noteref"><sup>37</sup></a> The full list shows the
author-practitioner had enough familiarity to describe the use of a
range of additional specialized materials (e.g., storax for a gout cure,
bread crusts to rid linseed oil of grease, lye of quicklime and litharge
for a black dye, and gold leaf to make rubies) and tools (e.g., plumb
line, compass, and ruler for drawing in perspective, looms for weaving
horsehair sieves, a mustard mill for grinding earth).<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38" role="doc-noteref"><sup>38</sup></a>
Surely, he possessed far more than can be ascribed to him based on his
own pronoun use.</p>
<h3 id="the-material-culture-of-the-french-goldsmith">The Material
Culture of the French Goldsmith</h3>
<p>Having established the baseline contents of the author-practitioner’s
workshop (and admitted that he will have handled a far greater range of
items than his explicit reporting implies), we can draw comparisons with
the materials and tools used by early modern French goldsmiths as
documented in contemporary inventories and visual sources. From the
second half of the sixteenth century, artists began to depict craft
practices and artisanal workspaces with greater frequency. Capitalizing
on the healthy market for technical literature and books of secrets that
had been in vogue for a half century, these artists offered buyers a
pictorial counterpart, and they developed conventions of representation
that would come to define the burgeoning genre and its task of
articulating the cultural inflections of artisanal work.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39" role="doc-noteref"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
<p>A wealth of information is contained in Étienne Delaune’s 1576
engraving of a goldsmith’s workshop (Fig. 1), and its companion piece,
which may illustrate the silversmithing end of the same workshop (<i><u>Fig.
3</u></i>). Delaune (1518/19–1583) was an esteemed goldsmith and
designer who worked for a time at the royal mint in Paris, produced
works for Henri II and the French court, and is today best known for his
many surviving prints and drawings for metalwork ornament.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40" role="doc-noteref"><sup>40</sup></a> Diane Lee Carroll has discussed
Delaune’s set of engravings of the goldsmith’s workshop in detail,
identifying the many specialized materials and tools, depicted with
special care, as well as the activities of the ten men shown at work.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41" role="doc-noteref"><sup>41</sup></a> She notes the presence of coils of
wire, crucibles, bellows, a flux dispenser, hammers, mallets, stakes,
anvils, punches, mortars and pestles, nippers, cutters, shears, pliers,
clamps, vises, tweezers, drawing plates, gravers, dividers, rasps,
brushes, and candles. This list is only marginally different from the
items recorded in the probate inventories of contemporary Parisian
goldsmiths, which have been extensively studied by Michèle
Bimbenet-Privat.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42" role="doc-noteref"><sup>42</sup></a> She notes a similar range of basic
tools for the activities of holding, cutting, pounding, piercing, metal
drawing, and measuring, though fewer related to heating processes and
more related to finishing techniques, such as goldsmiths pickle
(<em>bouture</em>; cf., <em>bouteure</em> in Ms. Fr. 640), burnishing
stones, pumice, and tripoli.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43" role="doc-noteref"><sup>43</sup></a> Studies of goldsmiths’
tools in New France reveal remarkable similarities.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44" role="doc-noteref"><sup>44</sup></a></p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/staging061825-0/images/ann_304_ie_19/1PKCQiKXAV7mmsnZUhPqqPs_a_nXJ4j8v.jpg" alt="fig. 3"><figcaption>Fig. 3. Étienne Delaune (1518/1519–1583), <em>A Goldsmith’s Workshop

Museum, London, 1863,1114.778. © The Trustees of the British Museum (<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"><u>CC BY-NC-SA

<p>All of the above-mentioned tools from the Delaune engravings and the
Parisian inventories make an appearance in Ms. Fr. 640, albeit with
slight variations here and there.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45" role="doc-noteref"><sup>45</sup></a> On the other hand, a
few items in Delaune’s engraving go entirely undiscussed in the pages of
the manuscript, including a wire-drawing bench, pitch bowls to support
punching and chasing, drills, balances, and calipers.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46" role="doc-noteref"><sup>46</sup></a>
Additionally, some of the core activities of the goldsmith are mentioned
only in passing in Ms. Fr. 640, notably raising (see fol. <a href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/32r/f/32r/tl"><u>32r</u></a>).
These differences are inconclusive, since neither Delaune’s depiction
nor Ms. Fr. 640 aims to be an exhaustive treatment of the goldsmith’s
art. More conclusive, perhaps, is the author-practitioner’s lack of a
tell-tale tool. Bimbenet-Privat has put forth the <em>bigorne</em>, a
double horn anvil, as the most emblematic tool of goldsmiths—those
working in Paris often possessed these anvils in multiples. This tool is
illustrated in the lower right of Delaune’s goldsmith’s shop, set into a
cylindrical stump, and it is nearly ubiquitous among the inventories of
goldsmiths working in New France.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47" role="doc-noteref"><sup>47</sup></a> While the
author-practitioner mentions an anvil (<em>enclume</em>) four times in
the manuscript, there is no mention of its more specialized variety, the
<em>bigorne</em>.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48" role="doc-noteref"><sup>48</sup></a> If he were a goldsmith, then he had
a sub-specialty that took him away from some of the more recognizable
activities of the trade.</p>
<p>Unusual points of contact between Ms. Fr. 640, Delaune’s engravings,
and probate inventories are more illuminating, perhaps, and the
author-practitioner’s focus on making sand molds for casting is worth
underscoring. As Carroll notes, this technique was relatively
undocumented at this time, though it would have been known by
pewterers.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49" role="doc-noteref"><sup>49</sup></a> While Biringuccio and Cellini had
related the technique in some detail in the <em>Pirotechnia</em> (1540)
and <em>I Trattati dell’Oreficeria</em> (1568) respectively, Delaune
contributes to this discourse with the earliest known depictions of
casting flasks.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50" role="doc-noteref"><sup>50</sup></a> These hang from pegs at the very
left edge of the goldsmith’s print and from pegs in the upper right
corner of the silversmith’s print (<i><u>Fig.
4</u></i>, <i><u>Fig.
5</u></i>). The author-practitioner’s preoccupation with making sand
molds and lifecasting placed him within a rarified circle of skilled,
erudite, and self-promoting artisans experienced in the arts of
fire.</p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/staging061825-0/images/ann_304_ie_19/1XiMROx7aFsEGvVIUT9WHfFlJKKmm1kmd.png" alt="fig. 4"><figcaption>Fig. 4. Étienne Delaune (1518/1519–1583), detail of casting flasks in

<p>If it is difficult to characterize the author-practitioner as a
goldsmith <em>tout court</em>, this may reflect the great freedom
afforded to this category of artisan, who could not only raise, chase,
and set an object with gems but could perform the functions of other
professionals—they could gild and cast even though there were
professional gilders and founders.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51" role="doc-noteref"><sup>51</sup></a> In Provence,
goldsmiths were unregulated by guild statutes until the early sixteenth
century; a 1498 probate inventory of a goldsmith from Draguignan
suggests how wide the range of materials and tools might be in an
independent workshop.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52" role="doc-noteref"><sup>52</sup></a> In addition to owning a large
collection of tools of the various kinds discussed above—including five
<em>bigornes</em> and a wire-drawing bench—this artisan’s workshop
contained finished objects, gold and silver coin for melting, various
measures of colored cloth, a pound and a half of coral, numerous
unmounted gemstones<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53" role="doc-noteref"><sup>53</sup></a> as well as stones explicitly
labeled as imitations.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54" role="doc-noteref"><sup>54</sup></a> If the professional autonomy of
this goldsmith afforded him an ampler inventory than his guild-bound
brethren elsewhere in France, then we might infer that the
author-practitioner was also an independent artisan.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55" role="doc-noteref"><sup>55</sup></a>
The entries of Ms. Fr. 640 suggest he enjoyed a greater professional
freedom still, with his interest not only in fine metalwork and
imitation gemstones but in alchemical secrets, weapons and military
strategy, optical effects, and experimental transformations of natural
materials. Moreover, it seems likely that he acted on these interests,
not simply collecting recipes and the know-how of other artisans but
experimenting in his workspace with tools and materials well beyond
those appropriate to the goldsmith’s trade.</p>
<h2 id="the-workshop-unbounded">The Workshop Unbounded</h2>
<p>In the first half of this essay, we considered the space of the
author-practitioner’s workshop. By isolating those passages in which the
author-practitioner gave first-hand accounts of his making experiences
(distinct from his first-hand witnessing or opinions), I offered a
conservative survey of the equipment, tools, and materials in his
workspace. I used his passing mention that he owned a goldsmith’s forge
to assess the material culture of his workshop against what is known of
contemporary French goldsmiths more generally. In spite of any
specialized training the author-practitioner may have had, he does not
fit the description of a goldsmith in any conventional, guild-regulated,
and commercial sense of the term.</p>
<p>In the second half of this essay, we will pull back from the narrow
investigation of the working space proper. The manuscript offers ample
evidence that the author-practitioner’s broader interests, alongside his
drive toward experiment and virtuosity in casting, required access to a
series of spaces, ever-widening in scope. These spaces extended from the
domestic and its close environs to the urban landscape, the countryside,
and the world beyond. Collectively, these spaces stand as an extended
supply chain of materials and expertise that support the activities of
the workshop. It is to these concentric circles of space and place, and
to the itineraries linking them, that we now turn.</p>
<h3 id="the-home-and-estate">The Home and Estate </h3>
<p>In the sixteenth century, it was common for an artisan’s workshop to
be integrated into the home. Accordingly, various rooms and areas in and
around the estate constitute an intimate part of the
author-practitioner’s working environment, field of inquiry, and
intended destination for crafted works.</p>
<p>Among the domestic spaces that appear in the manuscript we find
cellars and deep wells used to keep casting powders humid and items
cool; draft-proof rooms and roof drains used to help preserve fruit and
nuts long term; ovens from of which one takes freshly baked bread to
serve as a quick and ready molding material or to make room for small
animals to dry; fireplaces of big kitchens to harvest the best greasy
bister, a black soot pigment; and pantries where one finds the fattest
flies most suitable for casting from life.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56" role="doc-noteref"><sup>56</sup></a>
There is also implied access to more intimate spaces: private chambers
with ornate furniture, such as beds encrusted with counterfeit jasper
and stucco ornament or bedecked with valences decorated with stamped tin
sheets. Additionally, those entries that treat the decoration of grottos
(fols. <a href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/110r/f/110r/tl"><u>110r</u></a>
and <a href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/118r/f/118r/tl"><u>118r</u></a>)
suggest an implied familiarity with the fashionable estates of the
social elite. The intersection of workshop, home, household, and estate
reveal the interweaving stories of professional and daily life that
invest these spaces with meaning.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57" role="doc-noteref"><sup>57</sup></a></p>
<p>The author-practitioner can hardly refer to discrete places within
the estate without bringing them into animation as spaces for larger,
coordinated activity.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58" role="doc-noteref"><sup>58</sup></a> For instance, in the entry “Keeping
fruit for the entire year” on fol. <a href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/50r/f/50r/tl"><u>50r</u></a>,
we note the need for “a room where there is not a drop of air &amp; of
wind.” Despite the need for stillness, this room bears witness to
various comings and goings. One must carefully place there, upside down
on an even table, the glass ampuls one has already boiled (i.e.,
sterilized), which will eventually receive the fruit, as well as their
wax stoppers, made to measure; these have been presumably prepared
elsewhere beforehand (in the kitchen, perhaps?). One also returns to the
draft-free room to dexterously pack and stopper the ampuls with fruit
after a summer’s jaunt outdoors: we read about the need to carefully
hand pick seasonal fruits—cherries, plums, or whatever fruit one
wants—on a warm, dry day. Storage instructions for the bottled fruit
invoke further spaces and seasonal conditions around the estate: the
filled ampules are kept in a vat of water in the cellar through the
summer, but—anticipating that the vat of water might freeze in the
winter—one moves the bottles into a weighted basket lowered into a deep
well, where the water will “be like river water” (i.e., moving). In this
entry, the unfolding stories of activity temporarily transform the
draft-free room, the kitchen, the orchard, the cellar, and the well into
spaces of artisanal production.</p>
<h3 id="the-city">The City</h3>
<p>This animation of places continues as we reconstruct the movements of
the author-practitioner between his workshop and the city, which allowed
him to observe, record, and reimagine the work of other artisans for his
own ends. Mentions of the tiler’s oven, the potters’, furbisher’s, and
glassworker’s furnace, the blacksmith’s forge, the goldsmiths’ bench,
the pewterer’s wheel, fuller’s earth, currier’s water, gunpowderers burn
salve, etc., all evoke the stories of workshops, skilled craftspeople,
and their practices, as well as the author-practitioner’s privileged
access to all three. Artisanal workshops were found in nearly all
neighborhoods of sixteenth-century Toulouse, with craft workers often
clustered by profession, as they were in many early modern cities.
Archival records allow us to trace something of the
author-practitioner’s movements in Toulouse, especially along the right
bank in the six districts (<em>capitoulats</em>) of the city
(<em>cité</em>) proper (<i><u>fig.
6</u></i>).<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59" role="doc-noteref"><sup>59</sup></a></p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/staging061825-0/images/ann_304_ie_19/1Lq5oWa935SETcaUBcuW3JeWMLLvVcxI4.jpg" alt="fig. 6"><figcaption>Fig. 6.

<p>The author-practitioner’s references across the manuscript’s recipes
to flours, perhaps ground in the city’s mills, place him along the
Garonne, perhaps at the famous Bazacle mills to the north of the city or
at those along the edge of the island of Tounis. This island, which was
absorbed into the fabric of the city in the eighteenth century and is
today the city’s edge on the river, was home to dyers and starchers,
and, at its north end to slaughterers, butchers, and curriers who were
supported by neighboring abattoirs; this was but one of the various
places in the city where butchers clustered or an abattoir
(<em>affachoir</em>) could be found. It is in this neighborhood,
perhaps, that the author-practitioner sourced horn for his counterfeit
jasper or the ox foot bones he calcined as an ingredient in his
molds.</p>
<p>Crossing the <em>pont de Tounis</em> onto the mainland and into the
<strong>Dalbade</strong> district, the author-practitioner might have
encountered gold beaters and <em>orpailleurs</em>—panners for gold—who
lived on the <em>petite rue de la Dalbade</em>, from whom he could have
sourced the gold leaf and spangle gold that appear in the pages of Ms.
Fr. 640. On the nearby <em>rue des polinaires</em>, one wonders whether
he encountered any of the remaining polishers and burnishers of metals
for whom the street once took its name. Elsewhere in the Dalbade
district, he might have encountered the chair caners of the <em>rue du
coq-d’Inde</em>, the carpenters and wood merchants on the then <em>rue
des Fustières</em> (the southern half of today’s <em>rue des
Paradoux</em>), or the various bladeworkers (<em>espasiers,
taillandiers</em>, <em>esperonniers</em>, <em>couteliers</em>, and
<em>razoriers</em>) of the <em>rue des Couteliers</em>.</p>
<p>Walking east and crossing the <em>rue de Pharaon</em> into the
district of <strong>Saint-Barthélemy</strong>, the author-practitioner
could have observed on the <em>rue des Filatiers</em> the practices of
the city’s fashion workers (<em>tailleurs</em>, <em>boutonniers</em>,
<em>chaussetiers</em>, <em>couturiers</em>, <em>gantiers</em>,
<em>perruquiers</em>, and <em>brodeurs</em>). On the <em>rue de
Chapeliers</em>, then known as the <em>rue de Ugnères</em>, he might
have sourced some of the oils and suet for his workshop from the sellers
of fats (<em>ugnères</em>), whose shops were being slowly replaced by
those of the hatters, from whom the street would come to take its new
name. Around the Carmelite convent, <em>place des Carmes</em>, were
numerous small merchants and artisans; from the author-practitioner’s
time, goldsmiths began to take up shop in this neighborhood. Just as
eclectic was the <em>rue de Fleurs</em>, where he could have seen the
work of locksmiths, candle makers, and button makers, among others.</p>
<p>In the <strong>Pont-Vieux</strong> district, he could have seen
cauldron makers, crossbow makers, and doublet makers along the <em>rue
Peyrolières</em>, or spoken to lantern makers in their guild house on
the eponymous <em>rue Lanternières</em>. Some of the city’s many drapers
were to be found in the <em>rue de la Bourse</em> and the <em>rue
Cujas</em>.</p>
<p>In the <strong>Daurade</strong> district, along today’s <em>rue des
Blanchers</em> were found the leather bleachers, tanners, and
<em>chamoiseurs</em> as well as many of the city’s numerous fishermen,
from whom, perhaps, he might have sourced his cuttlefish bones or
materials for fish glue—or perhaps he got these from the fish hall in
the Pont-Vieux district. Of especial interest must have been the <em>rue
d’Argentières</em>, today the <em>rue Gambetta</em>, where he could have
found his artisanal kinsmen, the silversmiths and goldsmiths who
prepared the prizes of lifecast flowers for the city’s <em>jeux
floraux</em>.</p>
<p>The author-practitioner may have been privileged enough to enter the
arsenal, enclosed within the city hall complex in the
<strong>Saint-Étienne</strong> district, on the site of today’s
<em>Square Charles-de-Gaulle</em>.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60" role="doc-noteref"><sup>60</sup></a></p>
<p>Nevertheless, in the sixteenth century, it must have been the
eclectic <em><strong>Pierre</strong></em> district that captivated the
author-practitioner the most. There, in what is today the <em>rue des
Tourneurs</em>, he could have met artisans as varied as makers of arms,
makers of wooden troughs (<em>grazaliers</em>), turners, and
doublet-makers. Oil merchants and oil bearers were to be found in the
<em>rue Fourbastard</em>, and in today’s <em>rue des Arts</em>, part of
which was known in the sixteenth century as the <em>rue
Estagnères-Vielles</em>, he would have encountered the tinsmiths and tin
founders, in whose work he surely took a great interest.</p>
<p>As a larger-scale analog to his own experiments in small-scale
casting, the author-practitioner’s intense interest in the work of the
city’s founders is instructive: he weaves in and out of various
workshops and sites of production, observing, documenting, and
performing something akin to an ethnography of craft practice. He
records in detail the practices of various kinds of founders (artillery
founders, founders of large casts for statues, bell founders, founders
of small works of tin), noting their alloys, their mold materials, and
their heating practices. He even sketches the birds-eye view of a
founder’s “furnace for melting a large quantity of metal” on fol. <a href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/48v/f/48v/tl"><u>48v</u></a>
(<i><u>fig.
7</u></i>), schematically mapping out the infrastructure required for
large-scale casting. His engagement with founders is also personal in
nature—he discusses by name one family of founders active at the
Toulouse arsenal, the Poncet, observing that they use a different alloy
than is commonly used for the cannons of France, and he even records the
superstitions of founders (casting is unlucky on Monday, Wednesday,
Friday, and Sunday). A marginal inscription on <a href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/49r/f/49r/tl"><u>49r</u></a>
notes that the Poncet “cast with solder that <del>pewterers</del>
<sup>glassworkers</sup> use.” His correction here suggests his
familiarity with pewterers and glassworkers, setting up an implied
itinerary among workshops in the city.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61" role="doc-noteref"><sup>61</sup></a></p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/staging061825-0/images/ann_304_ie_19/158c-khJN7rDFRseIOkDE67IFXfI06OKQ.png" alt="fig. 7"><figcaption>Fig. 7.

<p>The founders and allied artisans of Toulouse were rich sources for
the author-practitioner, and he used his observations of their practices
to his own ends, hypothesizing, experimenting, and refining his way
toward ever-better mold-making materials and techniques. On <a href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/80v/f/80v/tl"><u>80v</u></a>,
in the entry “Founders of small works of tin,” he describes their work
in the third person, yet he makes three annotations in the left margin
that reveal his thought process as he shifts towards his own workshop
practice. The first marginal note gives advice to an unnamed or
impersonal “you:” “Make sure the&nbsp;pegs&nbsp;of your&nbsp;frame&nbsp;enter easily so
that&nbsp;<del>in opening</del> the frame will easily open without shifting
anything, and that your&nbsp;frames&nbsp;fit well together, &amp; the&nbsp;table is
quite even.” The next two are experimental exhortations: “Try to etch
with distilled vinegar.” “Try calcined oyster&nbsp;shells. They are said to
be excellent for molding.” In the entry “Method of casting in bronze” on
fol.&nbsp;<a href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/82v/f/82v/tl"><u>82v</u></a>,
as he describes the bronze founders’ process, he cautions that the high
heat makes the crucible prone to breaking, but, he writes, “you can lute
it as you know founders do,” an assumed knowledge for an assumed
reader—who may be none other than the author-practitioner himself.
Across these two entries, just a few folios apart, we see the
author-practitioner moving back and forth between a description of the
tin founder’s work and a reflection on his own, between their materials
and his equipment, between the bronze foundry and the workspace of his
manuscript’s addressee. We are left with an implied itinerary in and
around Toulouse that helps us to map his professional project.</p>
<p>The author-practitioner’s interaction with founders, particularly the
Poncet, may suggest his participation, however peripheral, in an
epistemic “trading zone.” These sites of innovation and knowledge
exchange among scholars and practitioners were often facilitated by
those with political power and economic means. Pamela O. Long has argued
that early modern arsenals as well as cities themselves were
paradigmatic trading zones, where textual and technical experts
commingled with political elites to further a common enterprise.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62" role="doc-noteref"><sup>62</sup></a> It is significant that, in this
period, Toulouse was host to a royal arsenal enclosed within the city
hall complex. A vibrant and localized knowledge exchange among scholars
from Toulouse’s university, metalworkers, and civic and royal
representatives clearly took place within the arsenal, yet conversations
must have, at times, continued outside its walls. The series of entries
in Ms. Fr. 640 on cannon caliber, mortars, and siege strategy record
surprisingly up-to-date information, and they may have been informed by
the author-practitioner’s interactions with the Poncet, with others
working in the arsenal, or with close associates of either.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63" role="doc-noteref"><sup>63</sup></a></p>
<p>These entries notwithstanding, there is little to suggest that the
author-practitioner had access to the arsenal himself. Rather, his
trading zone, the one in which he was an active contributor, was the
city of Toulouse writ large. As we have seen, he moves in and out of
various complementary spaces of making and knowing. He interacts with
artisans across the city’s neighborhoods, and he uses the information he
has gathered to innovate in his own workshop. Though we have no record
of the craft insights that he shared with his artisan interlocutors, he
most certainly brought something to the table. After all, on fol. <a href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/162r/f/162r/tl"><u>162r</u></a>,
he acknowledges the transactional nature of knowledge exchange and his
desire to both contribute and profit. In the entry “For the workshop,”
which seems to include prefatory material for the eventual publication
of his manuscript, he writes: “I, from a desire to learn, am exposing
what little is in my workshop to receive, through a common commerce of
letters, much rarer secrets.”</p>
<h3 id="the-countryside-and-beyond">The Countryside and Beyond</h3>
<p>As we have seen, Ms. Fr. 640 documents the author-practitioner’s
intense experimentation in his own workshop as well as his exploration
of the workspaces of artisans across Toulouse. The manuscript also
reveals much about the author-practitioner’s efforts to source materials
in the countryside and from regional and global trade networks. These
materials range from the generic to the specific, and the sites whence
he sources them range correspondingly from the implicitly unremarkable
to the highly particular and from the local to the global.</p>
<p>The manuscript abounds with references to natural and pastoral
environments, including hills, mountains, mines, quarries, rock caves,
gravel banks, sandy paths, the countryside, forests, meadows, fields,
vineyards, gardens, rivers, riverbanks, and the sea. Such generic
environments are often invoked as places to find generic materials, as
in the case of rivers, where one can source river water, river sand, and
river pebbles, all of which appear in the manuscript. Such generic
environments could also denote a metaphorical “anyspace.” In the entry
“Fountains” on <a href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/80r/f/80r/tl"><u>80r</u></a>,
the author-practitioner draws a bent-around cornet in the margin, a
device meant to work as a perpetual fountain. He notes that such a
device can be inserted into “some rock,” without bothering to tell us
anything more about its type, its finish, or its placement. Above, he
draws a charming mountainous landscape spanning the width of the folio,
with a pipe zigzagging from the mountain’s lower left to its upper right
(<i><u>fig.
8</u></i>). The mountains in this drawing, used to illustrate how “to
make water rise higher than its source,” are conceptual overkill; the
hydraulic principle in question presumably would hold at smaller scales
more common in fountain construction, and the entry itself discusses the
principle in isolation from any specific environment. Nonetheless, the
author-practitioner uses a slice of nature, here a mountain, to stand
indexically for anywhere that has a change in elevation.</p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/staging061825-0/images/ann_304_ie_19/1C_LLAUYzhTAKCEZqbzw4UHOn5C6CMWXh.png" alt="fig. 8"><figcaption>Fig. 8. Drawing of a water-raising device in a mountain landscape.

gallica.bnf.fr.</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>In rare cases, the author-practitioner is extremely specific about a
particular mine or a particular vineyard. When he is, he means to
emphasize that the location in question yields not merely a usable
material but the ideal resource for a given process of making—something
worthwhile seeking out from a particular palace. For instance, in “Sand
from Thoulouse” on fol. <a href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/87r/f/87r/tl"><u>87r</u></a>,
the author-practitioner notes: “The usual <em><del>bo</del></em>&nbsp;good
one is the one which is found in a vineyard near Puy David, but the one
which is most excellent is the one from the Touch, near Sainct Michel
&amp; toward Blagnac, in a vineyard that is quite high up.” When he is
relatively specific in his description of the source or site, he is
practicing a form of quality control over his workshop materials.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64" role="doc-noteref"><sup>64</sup></a></p>
<p>At the broadest level, the author-practitioner’s entries tell the
story of expanding global trade networks, with his references, for
example, to cochineal, pipes for smoking, and the “medicine of
Orientals.” In these references, materials, tools, and recipes travel
great distances before reaching the author-practitioner, who in turn
accommodates them in his workshop, the pages of his manuscript, and his
material imaginary. References to non-local materials tell spatial
stories of a pan-European community of professional artisans that
produce, trade, and use specialized and high-quality items, such as
“paper from Florence,” “chalk from Champaigne,” “glass from Lorraine,”
“lead from Germany,” “tripoli of Brittany,” “Cardona salt,” and
“Flanders blue.” Moreover, this community of artisans also practice
regionally specific techniques like “the work of the Flemish,” “the work
done in Algiers,” and “the work of Colchis,” which the
author-practitioner documents with interest. It is unclear from his
words whether many of these more distant places have lived meaning for
the author-practitioner or whether they exist only as part of a mental
map that helps him roughly distinguish near from far, his practice from
that of others, exempla with which to vie, and his world from worlds
beyond. In such attempts to distinguish, we can discern the
metageographies by which the author-practitioner ordered his knowledge
of the world.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65" role="doc-noteref"><sup>65</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="nature-as-storehouse-and-workshop">Nature as Storehouse and
Workshop</h3>
<p>As the author-practitioner explores the countryside around Toulouse,
sourcing materials for his artisanal experiments, we see him conceiving
of the space of nature as an environment and nature itself as an agent
that provide him with workshop supplies. For instance, in his singular
quest to find the ideal sands for mold-making, the author-practitioner
sources various material samples to be calcined and pulverized in his
workshop—some of which he would need to purchase but most of which he
could collect himself in and outside of the city. The natural materials
he eventually calcines include alabaster, slate, white pebbles, black
pebbles, pumice stone, horse bones, ox bones, human bones, cuttlefish
bones, river shells, oyster shells, sand, walnut wood, and vines. In his
forge and furnaces, he heats these materials to high temperatures until
they transform into a more friable substance or turn to ash. He then
grinds them finely, until they are impalpable, and either adds a binder
to simply cast with these experimental powders or uses them as additives
to improve the casting qualities of natural sands.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66" role="doc-noteref"><sup>66</sup></a>
In essence, the natural world, its fields, riverbanks, and forests were
stockrooms for goods.</p>
<p>The countryside around Toulouse functions as a storehouse of
materials when it comes to natural sands themselves, a critical
ingredient in the author-practitioner’s artisanal making. The
author-practitioner takes care describing the various qualities of
sands, and he has a sophisticated vocabulary of technical descriptors,
such as fatty, lean, the ability to take body, etc., that helps him
convey the desirable characteristics of sands and earths. Fortunately,
as he notes in a rare first-person statement, “the&nbsp;sand&nbsp;near my area&nbsp;is
very excellent” (fol.&nbsp;<a href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/69v/f/69v/tl"><u>69v</u></a>).<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67" role="doc-noteref"><sup>67</sup></a> He offers more specifics about
where to find that sand as the entries go on:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One can find an excellent one&nbsp;on the little hill&nbsp;of&nbsp;Puy David near
Thoulouse for lead, tin &amp; copper. (<a href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/81r/f/81r/tl"><u>81r</u></a>)</p>
<p>The&nbsp;sand from&nbsp;Thoulouse, which is taken, from the&nbsp;depths of the
earth, from the small hill of Puy David, is excellent in itself, but to
make it withstand several castings, I mix it with pulverized
sandever&nbsp;&amp; moistened, which hardens it, &amp; takes body &amp; bond
with it, &amp; makes it withstand&nbsp;<del>more than five</del>&nbsp;as many
castings as you wish.&nbsp;(<a href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/84r/f/84r/tl"><u>84r</u></a>)</p>
<p>The usual&nbsp;<em><del>bo</del></em>&nbsp;good one is&nbsp;the one which is found
in a&nbsp;vineyard&nbsp;near&nbsp;Puy David, but the one which is most excellent is&nbsp;the
one is from the&nbsp;Touch, near&nbsp;Sainct Michel&nbsp;&amp; toward Blagnac, in
a&nbsp;vineyard that is quite high up. (<a href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/87r/f/87r/tl"><u>87r</u></a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As these passages report, although the Puy David sand is good on its
own for casting in some metals and can be given greater longevity with
certain additives, it is surpassed in quality by that found in the
vineyard near the river Touch.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68" role="doc-noteref"><sup>68</sup></a> The
author-practitioner makes explicit the advantage of seeking out such
good sand a few folios later:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Artisans who work on big works&nbsp;&amp; to save time, do not need to
grind &amp; seek the curiosities of&nbsp;artificial sands, benefit from
seeking some ready-made by&nbsp;nature, which has the finest grain possible,
&amp; for small works, they only pass it through a&nbsp;sieve. (<a href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/88v/f/88v/tl"><u>88v</u></a>)</p>
<p>Artisans who work in big works, &amp; who need to further their
profit, by seeking things already prepared in nature, because she does
not sell her wares to her children, and to also save the time they would
use for grinding finely &amp; for artificially preparing&nbsp;sands, seek&nbsp;the
one of the&nbsp;<em><del>s</del></em>&nbsp;mine<del>s</del>, which is not too fat,
the one that is a kin of&nbsp;earth, not too lean &amp; consequently without
bond, but rather which is pulled&nbsp;from the depths of the sand-bed&nbsp;[...].
And because the latter is only found&nbsp;near the rocks in mountainous
areas, or&nbsp;lean territories&nbsp;&amp; akin to the&nbsp;<em>arene</em>, it cannot
be found&nbsp;<del>in</del>&nbsp;in the surroundings of all the&nbsp;<em>bonnes
villes</em>, where&nbsp;artisans&nbsp;willingly gather themselves. And thus, if
they do not have it&nbsp;close to their house, they prefer to have it come
from afar, like from Lyon, Venise, Parys near the Sainct Chappelle&nbsp;&amp;
similar places, rather than prepare it. However, you can be certain that
in all places you can render the&nbsp;sand from a&nbsp;mine good &amp; proper for
molding. (<a href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/90r/f/90r/tl"><u>90r</u></a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These two excerpts impart something more than a space animated
through narratives of activity. They hint at something like a
metageography that structures the author-practitioner’s understanding of
craft, commerce, and nature. It is useful here to draw on political
geographer John Agnew’s notion of the “sense of place,” which he defines
as an “identification with place as a unique community, landscape, and
moral order.”<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69" role="doc-noteref"><sup>69</sup></a> We have already seen how the
author-practitioner’s concept of Toulouse and its surrounds is wrapped
up with his artisanal enterprise. The community, as the
author-practitioner experiences it, is rich with practical expertise,
which he exploits as best he can through a lively exchange of knowledge;
presumably Toulouse ranks among the <em>bonnes villes</em> where
artisans of all stripes “willingly gather themselves.” Moreover, the
urban and exurban landscapes are abundant with materials, whether the
good sands and other such things found in the countryside or the
specialized commodities that could be imported into the cosmopolitan
city from preferred centers such as Lyon, Venice, or Paris. Together,
the community and landscape of Tououse offered a highly particular space
in which to source, observe, imitate, experiment, produce, and
exchange.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the values that underpin the author-practitioner’s
sense of place—that is, the moral order—emerge most clearly when he
discusses nature. For him, nature is not an abstract and extended space
abundant with materials and goods; the concept of nature as a place is a
later development in the French language.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70" role="doc-noteref"><sup>70</sup></a>
Rather, nature is a force of creation.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71" role="doc-noteref"><sup>71</sup></a>
It is a nurturing mother who gives freely so that “her children” might
economize time, labor, and costs. As Rebecca Zorach has shown, in the
sixteenth century, France was conceptualized as
Cybele/<em>Natura</em>/Artemis of Ephesus—a female body with endless
milk flowing from her (many) breasts (<i><u>fig.
9</u></i>). By extension, France and nature were understood as limitless
sources for the nourishment of the people and the production of
wealth.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72" role="doc-noteref"><sup>72</sup></a> The author-practitioner
participates in this discourse, whether knowingly or not. He personifies
nature both as the artisan-merchant, who makes and sells her wares, and
as mother, the inexhaustibly giving female body. He thus emphasizes
labor as a principle of material transformation and profit on the one
hand and appropriates the value of that labor as the righteous
entitlement of a child from its mother. As a result, the natural
environment functions not only as a storehouse of generic materials but
as the locus of an active mechanism, nature herself, that renders sand
“good &amp; proper for molding” by her processes. (After all, the
materials that an artisan finds available “already prepared” or
“ready-made by nature” were still made nonetheless.) Put otherwise, for
the author-practitioner, the materials found in the Toulousain
countryside are not raw as we might be accustomed to think of them today
but in various states of process—in preparation by a workshop assistant
who is also a mother figure. She dutifully gives to her artisan children
without asking anything in return so that they might “further their
profit” through her invisible labor, “to save time” “rather than
prepare” artificial sands themselves.</p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/staging061825-0/images/ann_304_ie_19/1SUHipYHMp6voaTb88dlnJWajTaKV_tOO.jpg" alt="fig. 9"><figcaption>Fig. 9. Niccolo Tribolo (1500–1550), <em>Nature</em>, ca. 1528/1529.

<p>The hill of Puy David, the vineyard of Touch, and the Toulousain
countryside are thus extensions of the workshop not simply in a loose
sense as sites where the author-practitioner gathers supplies for his
craft but more strictly as spaces where nature does the grunt work of
preparing materials for more specialized use by her master-artisan son
for the benefit of the “family” business. In this interpretation, the
author-practitioner’s sense of place evinces a moral order governed by
Christian virtue, here of selfless maternal charity, and a
proto-capitalist commodification of time, labor, and knowledge for use
in “common commerce”—of letters as well as goods. It is a sense of place
that elides the norms of patriarchal Christianity, domestic divisions of
labor, and guild-regulated hierarchy while it subtly foreshadows
centuries of extractive capitalism to come.</p>
