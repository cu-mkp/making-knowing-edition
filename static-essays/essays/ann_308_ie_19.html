        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <div>
            <p>BnF Ms. Fr. 640 offers a unique glimpse into the production and
                consumption of late sixteenth-century arms and armor. Most
                period sources, such as guild regulations, court documents,
                commissions, and inventories, provide only hints about the
                materials, techniques, cultural experience, and tacit knowledge
                that clearly once existed. A more vivid picture emerges from Ms.
                Fr. 640, which is discussed in this essay&nbsp;alongside
                surviving objects. The essay first addresses the craft of the
                furbisher or sword cutler discussed over four folios (fols. <a
                   href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/94r/f/94r/tl"><u>94r</u></a>–<a
                   href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/97r/f/97r/tl"><u>97r</u></a>),
                and then the use and maintenance of firearms, their projectiles,
                and plate armor referenced in several entries. Ms. Fr. 640
                reveals an industry reliant on a myriad of specialized
                sub-trades,&nbsp;where no single craftsmen can be credited with
                the finished product and sale of a sword, and a world in which
                plate armor and heavy cavalry were steadily giving way to
                advances and standardizations in firearms.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>Within BnF Ms. Fr. 640, arms and armor represent more than five per cent
        of the total entries. This includes extensive discussion of artillery,
        its use and material, which is interpreted in another essay by Pascal
        Briost.<a href="#fn1"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref1"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> The focus for this essay is on
        personal arms and armor, both civilian and military, a subject that can
        be organized around two main areas of interest dispersed in the text.
        The largest of these is a distinct section on the trade of the furbisher
        (sword cutler or retailer) (fols. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/94r/f/94r/tl"><u>94r</u></a>–<a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/97r/f/97r/tl"><u>97r</u></a>).
        The second represents practical notes on the use and maintenance of the
        arquebus (firearm) (fols. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/43v/f/43v/tl"><u>43v</u></a>–<a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/45v/f/45v/tl"><u>45v</u></a>,
        <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/55r/f/55r/tl"><u>55r</u></a>),
        together with scattered references pertaining to plate armor (fols. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/32r/f/32r/tl"><u>32r</u></a>,
        <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/56r/f/56r/tl"><u>56r</u></a>).
    </p>
    <p>These are not instructions for teaching entry into a craft. All of this
        content, as arranged by the anonymous author-practitioner, appears to be
        aimed at a reader or readers from the burgeoning middle and/or noble
        class in the late sixteenth century, instructing how to discern quality
        workmanship, as in the furbisher and armor entries, or conveying
        practices, as in the entries relative to firearms care and shooting.</p>
    <p>In the text of the manuscript, there are hints that the
        author-practitioner was not a “practitioner” per se of the art of
        furbishing, but experienced the craft through direct conversation with
        or observation of a local member of that trade. In one instance on fol.
        <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/94r/f/94r/tl"><u>94r</u></a>
        he references information given “according to the most competent,”
        undoubtedly a practicing furbisher. These notes on the furbisher in
        particular are perhaps found nowhere else in surviving sixteenth-century
        records.<a href="#fn2"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref2"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> Conversely, on the practical
        notes on firearms the author-practitioner might very well have had
        personal experience cleaning, maintaining, and handling firearms as well
        as producing projectiles. Though rarely written down so explicitly, this
        realm of knowledge would not be out of character in the period for a
        gentleman or noble, in touch with all things military or pertaining to
        civil defense. In the discussion of firearms, the author-practitioner’s
        voice is discernibly factual and authoritative.</p>
    <h2 id="the-furbisher">The Furbisher </h2>
    <p>The section of Ms. Fr. 640 dedicated to the craft of the furbisher or
        sword cutler occupies over four folios (fols. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/94r/f/94r/tl"><u>94r</u></a>–<a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/97v/f/97v/tl"><u>97v</u></a>).
        Fundamentally, furbishers—as conveyed in the manuscript text— were not
        makers but purveyors and refiners of swords, as in the English verb “to
        furbish.” They retailed and refined the semi-finished parts produced by
        specialized sword makers. That is, furbishers fitted/refitted or sold
        swords, daggers, and their hilts or guards, blades, and scabbards. This
        is made clear on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/94v/f/94v/tl"><u>94v</u></a>:
        “Those who create sword guards are artisans separate from furbishers.”
        On the next page (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/95v/f/95v/tl"><u>95v</u></a>)
        the author-practitioner notes that unfinished or partially finished
        guards can be bought by the furbisher by the dozen and then mentions
        several types that are available. The furbisher was also reliant on
        specialized craftsmen who prepare beech-wood scabbard halves called
        <em>estelles</em>, sold by the hundred (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/95v/f/95v/tl"><u>95v</u></a>).
        Leather for scabbards and grips were also purchased in bulk. The
        author-practitioner mentions not only the costs of various skins, but
        also how many scabbards they might yield (fols. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/94r/f/94r/tl"><u>94r</u></a>
        and <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/96v/f/96v/tl"><u>96v</u></a>).
        Further still, the text states that semi-finished blades were imported
        by the dozen—presumably by the furbishers of Toulouse, where the
        author-practitioner worked—from Spain, but also from Vienne in
        southeastern France (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/95r/f/95r/tl"><u>95r</u></a>).
    </p>
    <p>Like so many urban professions of the early modern period, furbishers
        came together as a guild, a corporation with a governing body that kept
        officers, controlled enrolment and rules for advancement from apprentice
        to journeyman (or companion of the guild) and, for some, to master
        furbisher. The guild also could offer aid to members and family members
        in need. Statutes or articles of the guild survive for Paris and, closer
        to the context of Ms. Fr. 640, for Toulouse.<a href="#fn3"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref3"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> These documents are similar for
        both cities, with those surviving from Toulouse dated to the early to
        mid-seventeenth century. Little information about actual techniques and
        skills is given in these sources, making the information recorded by the
        author-practitioner all the more unique and important.</p>
    <p>Fortunately, there are some contemporary visual sources that grant a
        glimpse of the furnisher’s work. Most notable is a fresco in the
        vaulting of the Uffizi palace in Florence, painted within a decade of
        Ms. Fr. 640 (<i><u>Fig. 1</u></i>). In the center foreground a master
        furbisher or journeyman is seen furbishing (i.e., polishing) a sword
        blade clamped into the very sort of bench described and illustrated by
        the author-practitioner on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/94v/f/94v/tl"><u>94v</u></a>.
        In the background is another worker spinning a large wheel powering a
        grinding wheel on which another furbisher grinds a sword blade. Along
        the back wall, men are found working at a forge and anvil. The text of
        Ms. Fr. 640 provides a means of understanding the postures and actions
        of all these men, and more.</p>

    <h2 id="the-culture-of-the-sword-in-late-sixteenth-century-france">The
        Culture of the Sword in Late Sixteenth-Century France</h2>
    <p>Despite the present popular image, swords were not commonly worn in the
        Middle Ages. It was not until the second half of the sixteenth century
        that, throughout Europe, a new civilian form of longer-bladed sword—the
        rapier or sword of the robe—was developed and carried by various levels
        of society.<a href="#fn4"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref4"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> Precisely at the time the
        author-practitioner was writing, France was in the thick of the Wars of
        Religion between political factions of Catholics and Protestants
        (1562–98). Conflict and its material culture were widespread and
        commonplace, experienced by all levels of society. Weapons and armor in
        this age were not just tools for self-protection and defense, but
        finely-made objects of personal adornment and fashion. Schools teaching
        gentlemen the art of defense also grew in popularity. For example, in
        1573 the Provençal fencing master and military professional, Henri de
        Sainct-Didier, published a treatise in Paris on the use of the sword.<a

    <p>Carrying the sword and knowing how to use it were integral to a
        gentleman’s social status. The diaries of an English gentleman, John
        North, from around 1578, show that his sword and its fittings were
        important parts of his wardrobe.<a href="#fn6"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref6"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> He records expenses for upgrading
        his swords, for example for covering his scabbard in velvet, having his
        dagger, rapier, and belt (girdle) russeted (that is either varnished or
        heat-treated to a dark color), also for having his sword gilded and
        fitted with a new scabbard and for having other swords re-gilded.
        Another entry shows buying iron hilts for use in swordplay practice as
        well as paying for fencing lessons. The furbisher’s trade grew to
        accommodate the needs of bourgeoning middle-class gentlemen such as
        these, just as they served the urban elite (patricians) and nobles for
        centuries.</p>
    <p>The text of Ms. Fr. 640 offers the ability to discern quality among the
        products of this essential trade through the strata of materials and
        refinement of a sword relative to the client’s wealth and social status.
        Whether your sword guard was heavily worked and burnished with thick
        gold leaf, custom fit and garnished with a calf leather scabbard and a
        silk and gold-threaded grip, or a simple sword with a hilt varnished in
        black and a grip covered in iron wire, fitted to a ready-made
        scabbard—this is all accounted for in the author-practitioner’s text,
        along with the relative costs of the associated materials for the
        furbisher. In the period there were many who complained, like the
        Elizabethan gentleman Philip Stubbes, of those aspiring middle-class men
        who carried “swords, daggers, and rapiers guilte, and reguilte,
        burnished, and costly ingraven. With all things else that any noble of
        honorable, or worshipfull man doth, or may weare, so as the one cannot
        easily be discerned from the other?”<a href="#fn7"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref7"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> There is an acknowledged wide
        range of products, something that resonates with our own modern age of
        production and consumption, just then flowering in this trade of
        self-defense and personal adornment. Social status was gauged and, on
        occasion, falsely gauged by the details of the furbisher’s art.</p>
    <h2 id="the-late-sixteenth-century-sword-and-its-design">The Late
        Sixteenth-Century Sword and its Design </h2>
    <p>As techniques of fencing gradually developed in the sixteenth century, so
        too did the sword. Form and function were entirely intertwined. For
        military use, general trends preferred the cut over the thrust, while
        the reverse was true for civilian purposes. Debates between contemporary
        fencing masters over this principle were many and often regionally
        driven.<a href="#fn8"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref8"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> Personal preferences aside, the
        shape and length of the blade along with its point of balance together
        with the hilt dictated how the weapon was to be used. Shorter blades of
        two feet or longer and with broader maximum widths of about three inches
        were generally intended for cutting blows in close compact formations of
        military engagements. In civilian one-on-one combat, like duels, longer,
        slender blades of three feet length or more, and a width of one to two
        inches or so were designed in favor of thrusting with linear movements
        intent on keeping distance from an opponent in open space. In the period
        both forms were generally known as swords without distinction. However,
        the term rapier began to find currency in the sixteenth century as a
        sword to wear with your civilian robes—literally as a contraction of the
        Spanish <em>espada ropera</em> or robe sword—rather than a military
        sword.<a href="#fn9"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref9"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
    <p>The term rapier has garnered some confusion since its broader use in
        modern times has associated it more with the hilt form—swords with
        guards that comprised many complex iron or steel branches—rather than
        considering the entire sword (hilt and blade) and its proportions. The
        manuscript text, however, does not use the term nor make such
        distinctions, and the small sketch of a sword guard or hilt drawn in the
        margins on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/94r/f/94r/tl"><u>94r</u></a>
        could be either military or civilian. As the sixteenth century
        progressed, hilts developed ever more complex arrangements of bars meant
        to guard the unarmored user’s hand against an opponent’s cuts and
        thrusts. Addressing these design elements, the author-practitioner
        provides the terms for various parts of the hilt (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/94r/f/94r/tl"><u>94r</u></a>).
    </p>
    <p>In modern translation, some terms remain an interpretation based on the
        author-practitioner’s order and association between the parts. The
        diagram in Fig. 3 pictures a contemporary late sixteenth-century rapier
        labeled with the author-practitioner’s terms in red beside modern
        English terms in parentheses (<i><u>Fig. 3</u></i>).</p>

    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>The term <em>pontet</em> or “bridge”
        likely refers to the forward ring or port ring of the guard. In the text
        it is described as a strip of iron that connects the rings, as well as
        the part that prevents thrusts from entering into the guard (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/94r/f/94r/tl"><u>94r</u></a>).
        Beginning around the 1580s, the period of this manuscript, the port ring
        could be fitted with a steel plate to close the ring and prevent thrusts
        from entering. This added further protection to the user’s hand,
        especially when attempting certain attacks commonly found in
        sixteenth-century fencing manuals. In modern fencing, such a movement is
        termed a counterattack in opposition, that is, simultaneously diverting
        or parrying an opponent’s thrust by sliding against their blade while
        thrusting towards the opponent’s body. Though not the main focus, the
        text offers this one brief insight into the intended function of the
        hilt’s design.</p>
    <p>The author-practitioner also defines three types of blades. Those with a
        sharp ridge running down their middle, those with flutes or channels
        called fullers, and those with beveled edges but with a flattened center
        (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/94r/f/94r/tl"><u>94r</u></a>).
        The latter he deems the least likely to break, whereas the other two are
        both difficult to polish and break more easily. Many blades in this
        period use a fuller or series of fullers in what is called the forte or
        the heavier third of the tapered blade closest to the hilt. This is the
        part that must be strong and stiff to successfully push aside or parry
        an opponent’s blade. Fullers as well as the sharp ridge are designed to
        act like corrugations to brace the blade. Without them, the blade is too
        wobbly to maintain point control in fencing. The third type, although
        devoid of a fuller, would have a diamond cross-section in some parts of
        the blade that acts in a similar way.</p>
    <p>There was a fashion precisely in the time of Ms. Fr. 640’s composition
        and into the early seventeenth century for sword and dagger blades with
        elaborate groupings of fullers, some even pierced. Considering the
        author-practitioner’s note on how these are prone to breaking, these
        fullers were perhaps a decorative expression of the furbisher’s art
        rather than a useful advantage as a weapon. A means of showing
        virtuosity in their trade as well as displaying wealth for the consumer.
        To achieve a bright polish in the crevices of these deep fullers, a
        specially shaped attachment was applied into the polishing stick called
        the <em>fustée</em>. An extreme example of a pierced blade with three
        fullers of about 1600, formerly in the armory of the Duke-Elector of
        Saxony, is now in the collection of the Victoria and Albert Museum (<i><u>Fig. 4</u></i>). The forte of the blade may be elaborately
        worked, but the remainder of the blade is shaped like the
        author-practitioner’s preferred type with a flattened center. Many
        blades exhibited a combination of the types described.</p>

    <p>Another essential part of sword design discussed in the manuscript is the
        handle or grip. The binding materials of the grip varied widely, though
        they were all applied over wooden pieces, or”scales,” cut with a hole
        for the blade’s tang or <em>queue</em> (tail) to pass through. Gummed
        wax or a wax mixed with pitch was used to stick down the bindings. Iron
        wire is described as the cheapest but also the most hard-wearing. Finer
        silk cord stranded on a spinning wheel and mixed with gold and silver
        threads were most costly, but certainly more fragile (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/94r/f/94r/tl"><u>94r</u></a>).
        Relatively few period grips remain with silk binding as the organic
        material is extremely light sensitive and shatters over time. An example
        of a surviving grip with a mix of green silken cord and copper with iron
        wire from a later period, about 1630, is in the collection of the Art
        Institute of Chicago (<i><u>Fig. 5</u></i>).</p>

    <p>An unexpected, more durable option for sword grips discussed in the text
        is made from the dried skins of dogfish, a type of sand shark found
        throughout the Atlantic. It apparently “gives a good grip even if the
        hand is sweating” (Fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/94r/f/94r/tl"><u>94r</u></a>).
        This quality is due to the fine wart-like bumps, the calcified papillae
        of the dried skin, similar to stingray skin commonly known as shagreen.
        This material was often used in South East Asian arms and armor,
        particularly in China and Japan. Whether its use was developed
        independently in Europe or spread from China via trade with the Ottomans
        in the Mediterranean, it is difficult to be sure. Among the earliest
        examples of daggers and swords with shark- or ray-skin grips are those
        produced for the Duke-Electors of Saxony to equip their personal guard
        unit. Ordered by the hundreds from blade smiths and assembled by court
        cutlers for the Duke-Elector, these pieces were exceptionally preserved
        in the Dresden armory and are now dispersed in many public and private
        collections. An example of a rapier with a shark- or ray-skin grip
        nearly contemporary with Ms. Fr. 640, held in the Art Institute of
        Chicago (<i><u>Fig. 6</u></i>), was used as the basis for the diagram
        above (Fig. 3).</p>

    <p>Outside of the Dresden armory group, period shark-skin grips seem
        exceptionally rare, though relatively few late sixteenth- and early
        seventeenth-century swords and rapiers are as well preserved and intact
        with all their fittings as this group. The survival rate is vastly
        disproportionate to what once existed. Ms. Fr. 640 fills a considerable
        void in understanding the materials, as well as the tools and techniques
        of the furbisher, to which this essay now turns.</p>
    <h2 id="furbishing-a-late-sixteenth-century-rapier-tools-and-techniques">
        Furbishing a Late Sixteenth-Century Rapier: Tools and Techniques</h2>
    <p>With some helpful sketches as well as material descriptions, the
        author-practitioner of Ms. Fr. 640 goes to considerable lengths in
        laying out the tools of the furbisher’s trade. Among the first pieces of
        notable equipment is the <em>chameau</em>, a long parallel bench used to
        clamp down a sword blade while polishing (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/94v/f/94v/tl"><u>94v</u></a>).
        This important device and its use with the polishing tool or stick
        called the <em>fustée</em> is depicted in the center foreground of the
        furbisher’s workshop in the fresco from the ceiling of the Uffizi
        galleries in Florence mentioned above (Fig. 1). The author-practitioner
        notes that this bench was made of rowan or mountain ash, a hard,
        even-grained wood. Balanced on four legs connected to a long plank or
        body it resembles a quadruped, hence the name <em>chameau</em> or camel.
        This low bench made it possible for the furbisher to use their upper
        body while adopting a forward posture over the clamped blade. Some rare
        depictions of the <em>chameau</em>, as in a blackwork enamel design
        print for a sword fitting, shows a furbisher using the long plank to
        rest the knee as an anchor for more leverage while polishing (<i><u>Fig. 7</u></i>).</p>

    <p>These postures, pieces of tacit knowledge particular to this trade, are
        all but lost aside from these few depictions and this text. One note in
        Ms. Fr. 640 mentions that a sword is given a better cutting edge by the
        motion of “pulling upward [with the burnishing tool] from the point [of
        the blade]” (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/94v/f/94v/tl"><u>94v</u></a>).
        The polishing tool used in this operation, called the <em>fustée</em>,
        is also sketched and described in detail. It appears to have an upper
        and lower half—the stick and the arson—that acts like a bow-shaped clamp
        to hold a piece of square boxwood “three fingers thick,” used in
        conjunction with oil for lubrication and emery as an abrasive (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/94v/f/94v/tl"><u>94v</u></a>).
        Presumably the hard boxwood would take hold of a film of emery and rub
        it flat against the beveled edges and sides of the blade. For fullers or
        grooves, as noted above, a specially made <em>fustée</em> with a narrow
        boxwood insert would be used (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/94r/f/94r/tl"><u>94r</u></a>).
        Other tools for polishing are mentioned: the <em>grateau—</em>described
        as of steel, square in section, used to remove grinding marks as well as
        honing a cutting edge; the <em>fresil—</em>a willow stick used with iron
        scale, the ferrous material collected from a blacksmith, as an abrasive
        for cleaning off rust; then two sketches in the margins show a
        <em>bruisson</em> or burnisher and a bloodstone, the hardstone
        burnishing tool used for a glass-like polish. At the top of folio <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/94v/f/94rvtl"><u>94v</u></a>,
        there is also a sketch of a scabbard bench, that appears to be a large
        plank lifted on two legs at one end used for hand-planing or shaping the
        <em>estelles</em>, that is, the two beechwood halves that form a
        scabbard. The procedure for using this bench and making the scabbard is
        detailed on folios <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/95v/f/95v/tl"><u>95v</u></a>–<a

    <p>On fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/95r/f/95r/tl"><u>95r</u></a>,
        the author-practitioner gives a step-by-step account of the process of
        furbishing a sword, that can be broken down as follows:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <blockquote>
                <p>The first step is drawing out the <em>queue</em> (tang) of
                    the acquired semi-finished blade, either by the furbisher
                    himself if he has a forge, or contracting a farrier
                    (blacksmith) or locksmith to do it for him. This will be
                    covered by the grip and topped by the pommel on the finished
                    sword.</p>
            </blockquote>
        </li>
        <li>
            <blockquote>
                <p>The blade is then passed over to the grinding stone likely to
                    establish the cutting edges and rough shape.</p>
            </blockquote>
        </li>
        <li>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Next, the blade is set into the <em>chameau</em> (furbishing
                    bench) where fine flour-like emery powder “soaked in oil to
                    make it hold” is used with the <em>fustée</em> to remove the
                    striations left by the grindstone.</p>
            </blockquote>
        </li>
        <li>
            <blockquote>
                <p>A drop or two of oil is applied to give the blade luster.</p>
            </blockquote>
        </li>
        <li>
            <blockquote>
                <p>The furbisher begins polishing the blade again on the
                    <em>chameau</em> with a <em>felin</em>—another kind of
                    burnishing stick that has a hardstone mounted on it.</p>
            </blockquote>
        </li>
        <li>
            <blockquote>
                <p>With the oil already on the blade, a fine polish is given
                    with chalk followed by wiping the blade down and a dry
                    (oil-less) polish with chalk.</p>
            </blockquote>
        </li>
        <li>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Once the blade is completely mounted, the final sharp hone is
                    given with the <em>grateau</em> or square-section steel
                    burnisher.</p>
            </blockquote>
        </li>
        <li>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Before the final mounting, the polished blade is tried on the
                    intended hilt, passing the tang through the opening on the
                    <em>escusson</em> (quillon block) and holding it in the hand
                    to assess the weight of the complete sword. Though not
                    discussed in depth in the text, this step is likely intended
                    to feel the balance of the blade and hilt together.</p>
            </blockquote>
        </li>
        <li>
            <blockquote>
                <p>The blade is placed between two pieces of wood and tightened
                    into a vise while the pierced opening of the quillon block
                    is widened with a file to fit the tapered tang of the blade.
                </p>
            </blockquote>
        </li>
        <li>
            <blockquote>
                <p>To complete the process, the finished hilt, and—although not
                    mentioned in the text—also the completed grip, is passed
                    over the tang of the blade that is fixed in the vice. To
                    clench or peen the tang over the pommel, described as
                    riveting, the furbisher uses a piece of wood over the button
                    or top of the pommel, and then, “with a&nbsp;hammer, one
                    beats on it to align &amp; secure the pommel well” (fol. <a
                       href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/95r/f/95r/tl"><u>95r</u></a>).&nbsp;
                </p>
            </blockquote>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The procedure of riveting the tang is similar to forging the head of a
        nail, and some furbishers facet the head of the riveted tang into a
        diamond point similar to decorative nail heads of the period. The
        author-practitioner warns that these are not as good as round heads, as
        the facets are more likely to break (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/95r/f/95r/tl"><u>95r</u></a>).
        Most riveted tangs on extant rapiers of the period are rounded or
        flattened at the button end of the pommel, though many rapiers and
        daggers of the group produced for the court and guard unit of the
        Dukes-Electors of Saxony, about 1590–1600, have tangs filed into a
        diamond shape on top of the button.<a href="#fn10"

    <p>From these concise step-by-step notes, a better picture of the labor
        involved in polishing and assembling swords and rapiers emerges. Not
        unlike a woodworker hand-planing wood, the furbisher uses a series of
        ever finer steps including heavy polishing with abrasives (emery, then
        chalk together with oil, then polished dry without oil), and then with
        burnishers (the hardstone <em>felin</em> and the hardened steel
        <em>grateau</em>), for a final polish and hone. Few sources give as much
        detail. In article seven of the Toulouse furbishers’ guild (1625), a
        sword submitted as a masterpiece for judgment by the guild officials was
        to be “well polished like silver.”<a href="#fn11"

    <h2 id="furbishing-sword-guards">Furbishing Sword Guards</h2>
    <p>The text of Ms. Fr. 640, details another important aspect of the
        furbisher’s trade, the finishing and decoration of sword guards or
        hilts. Furbishers relied on the guard makers to forge-weld the complex
        arrangement of barred guards mentioned in the text. The
        author-practitioner gives some account of how guards could be bought by
        the furbisher “by dozens,” either in a cheaper semi-finished state or
        “worked,” which costs more, “depending on its fashion” (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/95v/f/95v/tl"><u>95v</u></a>).
        A list of the various types of guards is given with descriptions:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Worked</p>
        <p>Guttered, which is with round moldings</p>
        <p>Pearled</p>
        <p>Scarfed, when the bands are crosswise</p>
        <p>Onioned, which is with a flat head</p>
        <p>In the&nbsp;King’s manner, which are plain</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>These short but alluring descriptions are
        difficult to pair with surviving hilts. Nevertheless, they give a rare
        view into a late sixteenth-century world of defined styles and trends.
        Rapier hilts are now generally difficult to attribute to any particular
        nationality or region, though distinctions certainly existed.<a

    <p>Some of the most substantial information on the craft of the furbisher
        given in Ms. Fr. 640 concerns the furbishing or finishing of sword
        guards. They include instructions for achieving the “color of water”
        which is a heat treatment to turn the polished steel hilt a dark, almost
        iridescent blue-black (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/96v/f/96v/tl"><u>96v</u></a>),
        several colors of varnished finishes (fols. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/4v/f/4v/tl"><u>4v</u></a>,
        <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/96v/f/96v/tl"><u>96v</u></a>),
        and lastly, the technique of mechanically plating the steel surface of a
        guard with silver or gold, a process known as “false” damascening (fol.
        <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/97r/f/97r/tl"><u>97r</u></a>).
        The purpose for all these finishes were twofold: to protect the iron or
        steel of sword guards from corrosion due to moisture and the sweat of
        those who handle them, and to ornament or decorate the hilt and other
        fittings, as these weapons also functioned as fashion accessories
        indicating one’s wealth and place in society.</p>
    <p>Plain steel hilts were used, especially for practice weapons that would
        receive considerable dents and mars that would damage even a
        hard-wearing finish; but for daily dress and even military use,
        protective finishes were more practical. Today, many swords and rapiers
        survive from the late sixteenth and the first half of the seventeenth
        century in a plain steel state. Occasionally, traces of a finish might
        be found in some of the deepest crevices between branches and hidden
        nooks in pommels. These finishes generally do not survive well through
        the centuries. The contemporaneous group of rapiers from the Dresden
        court of Saxony are unique in their excellent preservation, and coupled
        with the text of Ms. Fr. 640, it becomes clear that these finishes were
        much more commonplace. An example is the rapier in Fig. 8. It shows some
        minute traces of silvering, a mechanical plating of the entire hilt with
        a layer of silver leaf, almost entirely rubbed off apart from some
        tarnished traces at the base of the pommel and at the join of some
        branches. Considering this, it is evident that this rapier looks
        appreciably different now than it did when it left the late
        sixteenth-century furbisher’s hands. Indeed, we know from some period
        sources that gentlemen might send their rapiers to be re-silvered or
        re-gilt as they would have worn down with wear and excessive
        polishing.<a href="#fn13"

           id="fnref13"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> Looking at sixteenth-century
        male portraits shows why this is the case, as the left hand is often
        found in a posture engaging the grip or resting along the side of the
        hilt. One documented case of an Englishman, Arthur Throckmorton,
        highlights the importance of these finishes: in 1583 he had his plain
        steel rapier silvered for the first time in preparation of attending
        court, no doubt concerned about a decorous appearance.<a href="#fn14"

        accounts, Ms. Fr. 640 provides a rare means of understanding the other
        side of the story: the work done in repairing or adding finishes to

    <p>The author-practitioner discusses the black varnish used on guards very
        early on in the manuscript on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/4v/f/4v/tl"><u>4v</u></a>
        and then cross-references to his section on the furbisher and fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/97r/f/97r/tl"><u>97r</u></a>.
        This varnish, used on guards as well as other iron objects, trunk bands,
        and plate armor, was intended to resist rust and seal the iron or steel
        off from moisture. The essay by Celine Camps in this edition explores
        this recipe in great detail, attempting a reconstruction and showing
        that a fair amount of experience and judgment of heat and materials was
        required to successfully produce the desired even and glossy-black
        surface.<a href="#fn15"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref15"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> The recipe calls for boiling
        linseed or walnut oil with garlic, hog’s fennel or bread crumbs to
        degrease the oil, then adding pitch and grains of wheat until the pitch
        is fully melted. This mixture is then applied with a brush or feather
        over the steel guard heated in a charcoal fire. In several coatings, the
        varnish is burned on until it “no longer smokes” (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/4v/f/4v/tl"><u>4v</u></a>).
        Some extant sword hilts and armor have traces of this or a similar black
        varnish. Here again, a large subgroup of swords from the guard unit of
        the Duke-Electors of Saxony are coated in a black varnish (<i><u>Fig. 9</u></i>). Along the swelling bulge of the pommel on the sword
        in Fig. 9, some of the lustrous varnish has rubbed away revealing the
        “gray” color achieved by the preparatory heat treatment detailed on fol.

    </div>
    <p>The most basic, yet labor intensive, finish is to use heat through a
        charcoal fire to oxidize the steel surface of the guard. Though not
        understood on a molecular level by furbishers and blacksmiths of the
        period, heating the surface of steel produces a film-like oxide layer
        causing a refraction of light to appear. Depending on the temperature
        reached on the steel surface, the depth of this layer of oxide refracts
        the light differently, ranging from straw color (about 204°C) to purple
        (about 282°C) to blue (about 310°C) then to gray (about 371°C).
        Fittingly, the author-practitioner refers to this temperature index as
        “passing” from one color to another (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/96v/f/96v/tl"><u>96v</u></a>).
    </p>
    <p>Aside from adding an attractive color to the hilt or guard, this
        technique has the benefit of oxidizing the steel surface, thereby
        forming a protective barrier to resist rust. The barrier, however, can
        be rubbed off and broken down if not cared for or maintained. Therefore,
        varnish was a more practical but less attractive alternative, as relayed
        in the text: “grey is the lesser color [to blue] after varnish” (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/96v/f/96v/tl"><u>96v</u></a>).
        There was an evident hierarchy of hilt colors relative to the color’s
        brilliance as well as the expense of labor and maintenance required, a
        part of the visual language of conspicuous wealth and status in the
        period.</p>
    <p>The simplest to achieve was the color grey, used as a base layer for the
        varnishes as well as for applying gold and silver leaf in the process of
        false damascening (discussed below). The author-practitioner warns not
        to go beyond the gray color as, in the furbisher’s empirical experience,
        it will “throw off filth” and is then unable to accept the layers of
        applied precious metal plating or any of the surface colors (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/96v/f/96v/tl"><u>96v</u></a>).
        This can be interpreted as reaching so thick a layer of oxide on the
        surface of the guard—at a temperature beyond perhaps about 390°C—that it
        can no longer refract light and appears opaque or “filthy” and perhaps
        difficult to work.</p>
    <p>The first step in producing a heat treatment finish on the guard and
        pommel is to polish all the parts bright. This provides a mirror-like
        base to increase the depth of refraction in the oxide layer. Then, the
        furnace or charcoal fire must burn for one-to-two hours to produce the
        hot ash into which the hilt is placed (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/96v/f/96v/tl"><u>96v</u></a>).
        Once covered in the hot ash and visibly passed to a blue or gray color,
        the guard is rotated. In an age before thermometers, achieving an even
        color finish by maintaining a level temperature on surfaces of variable
        thicknesses must have presented a significant challenge, perfected only
        through experience. If the color “passed” beyond gray, presumably the
        whole process would have to start again, laboriously polishing down the
        surface to bare metal.</p>
    <p>To obtain what the author-practitioner refers to as “the color of water,”
        the process is even more labor intensive, according to the text: “One
        needs almost one&nbsp;day&nbsp;for preparing, softening &amp; setting in
        the color of water” (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/96v/f/96v/tl"><u>96v</u></a>).
        From the description, the color may be interpreted as a deep iridescent
        blue-black that resembles the sunlight color of deep ocean water. What
        might correspond to this finish is preserved on some of the rapiers from
        the Dresden group, for example on the pommel of the rapier in Fig. 3 and
        <i><u>Fig. 10</u></i>. The labor was not only in filing and burnishing
        the guard bright or “white” in the first stage, but also after passing
        the guard to blue or almost gray. In the process, the guard is taken
        while still “moderately hot” to a vise and burnished with a bloodstone
        (heliotrope) burnishing tool. This is done in multiple passes of heating
        and polishing until the depth of finish is obtained. So sensitive and
        fragile is this finish that, as the author-practitioner warns, the
        surface of the guard must remain hot while burnished or
        “the&nbsp;bloodstone&nbsp;would scrape &amp; undo the color” (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/96v/f/96v/tl"><u>96v</u></a>).

           role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> One detail that Ms. Fr. 640 adds
        is the importance of working or burnishing the layers of gold or silver
        while the steel surface of the piece is still hot. The
        author-practitioner even elaborates on how one should bring the guard
        close to the nose to judge the temperature from the radiant heat. As
        with the technique of burnishing the brilliant blue in the “Color of
        water,” the text suggests that the heat helps in the burnishing process.
    </p>
    <p>What is so striking about the author-practitioner’s text regarding the
        profession of the furbisher is how connected and reliant the trade was
        on the work of a wide range of specialized sub-trades: guard makers,
        bladesmiths, scabbard blank makers, in addition to possibly blacksmiths,
        locksmiths, those in the trade of textiles and velvets for grip and
        scabbard coverings, as well as those who made charcoal or oils and
        produced polished hardstone burnishers, among others. Even fishmongers
        were likely involved to obtain dried dogfish or sand shark skin for
        grips. The network was complex and far reaching as much as local.
        References to trade amongst craftsmen, costs relative to the distances
        materials traveled, as well as the compensation for the degree of
        refinement are scattered throughout the text. The author-practitioner
        has given a picture of an industry where no single craftsmen can be
        credited with the finished product. In museums and collections
        everywhere, there is an attempt to identify the bladesmith or, in some
        cases, a goldsmith or cutler (furbisher) responsible for certain swords.
        This is perhaps a misleading emphasis. In truth, the production of these
        weapons, especially those of the finest craftsmanship, are products of
        complex collaborative processes. The more elaborate in the decoration
        and materials, the more compound in their execution. Understanding the
        nature of the production of these pieces goes a long way in interpreting
        their material composition and explain the inability to generally
        attribute these pieces, aside from their occasional—and sometimes
        fraudulent—bladesmith and goldsmith marks.</p>
    <h2 id="firearms-and-armor">Firearms and Armor</h2>
    <p>In the folios of Ms. Fr. 640 that discuss firearms or armor, the
        narrative is not one of trade or production, but of consumption. The
        author-practitioner is recording practical knowledge useful to military
        men as much as the middle-class bourgeoisie who might be part of civic
        militia or called upon to defend the city. Although perhaps not
        intentionally, the author-practitioner’s scattered entries also record
        the tensions between two technologies: an arms race between the
        ascendance of offensive firearms versus the tradition of defensive plate
        armor which was in gradual decline at the time. Considering the context
        of the wars that consumed France in the period of the manuscript’s
        composition, the presence of entries on firearms and armor are not
        surprising.<a href="#fn18"

        one form of long-barreled gun—the arquebus. After a few hundred years of
        development since the end of the thirteenth century, gunpowder
        production in sixteenth-century Europe was becoming regularized, as were
        ordnance sizes (for artillery) and standards in firearms. The
        author-practitioner refers to at least two sizes of firearm as well as
        the appropriate measure of powder relative to the weight of the bullet
        (lead ball). These were: <em>l’harquebus de chasse</em>, a
        longer-barreled fowling piece associated with hunting (<em>chasse</em>)
        with a long range of about 66 yards (80 paces), and the
        <em>harquebus</em> or <em>haquebute</em>, the arquebus, a slightly
        shorter-barreled gun with a range of about 50 yards (60 paces) that was
        in common military use for most of the sixteenth century (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/43v/f/43v/tl"><u>43v</u></a>).
        Concepts of standards had been developing gradually for some time,
        mostly specific to regions, but here there is a clear intent.</p>
    <p>On fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/45v/f/45v/tl"><u>45v</u></a>,
        the author-practitioner provides a sketch of what is described as an
        arquebus, with a long barrel fitted or inlaid into a hook-shaped wooden
        stock. In the period, this distinct form of stock shape with its
        hook-butt end was also referred to as a petronel in both English and
        French. The term derived from the French for
        <em>petrinel</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em>poitrinal,</em> referring to the
        chest. The hook shape of the butt end was pressed against the breast or
        sternum of the shooter to fire, rather than the shoulder as in modern
        long-barreled firearms (<i><u>Fig. 12</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 13</u></i>).
        Early arquebuses from the late fifteenth century into the first half of
        the sixteenth century were fired from the cheek. By the middle of the
        sixteenth century, as the sizes of the projectile, charge of black
        powder, and relative recoil (back-shock from the explosive power)
        gradually increased, stocks with breast hooks were an improvement to
        help a shooter both aim down the barrel and absorb the recoil. Firing
        from the chest, however, was relatively short-lived as a design solution
        to this problem. Shooters or <em>harquebusiers</em> would experience
        chronic pain and bruising of their sternum. Consequently, this stock
        shape was only in common use from about 1560 to 1590, supplanted by
        shoulder stocks found on heavier muskets and shorter carbines that
        developed around the same time.</p>

    <p>Ms. Fr. 640 was written precisely in the time and place when this form of
        hook-shaped stock was particularly favored, but not without recording
        its associated issues. In multiple entries, the text recommends a means
        to reduce recoil. Rather than attributing the issue to the design of the
        stock, the entries diagnose other features. On fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/43v/f/43v/tl"><u>43v</u></a>,
        the author-practitioner suggests that the culprits were barrels made
        with chambers—smaller cavities to accept the charge of black powder—that
        caused a stronger explosive force, and recommends barrels without
        chambers, the alternative being a flat breech plug or end to the barrel
        tube. He also suggests reducing the fouling—that is, the filth or
        burned-up residue of black powder—by shooting with oiled linen wadding
        (the plug inserted to keep a bullet or lead ball packed behind the
        powder charge), cleaning one’s gun with oil every eight days (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/44r/f/44r/tl"><u>44r</u></a>),
        as well as a peculiar form of ramrod that charges the powder down the
        barrel without sprinkling it around the walls of the barrel. This is
        accomplished with a ladle-like device that screws into the end of the
        ramrod, similar to the method used for charging powder into a cannon
        barrel. The author-practitioner suggests that different sizes should be
        available for different ranges. To load, one fills the small pipe-like
        ladle with powder, points the gun muzzle downwards and loads the rod
        vertically without spilling the powder (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/45v/f/45v/tl"><u>45v</u></a>).
        Once in place, the arquebus is turned right side up and the rod is
        removed, leaving the powder at the breech. To this writer’s knowledge
        there are no extant examples of late sixteenth-century arquebuses with
        this type of ladle-tipped ramrod, though perhaps they were more common
        in the period. Nevertheless, it seems an impractical means of reducing
        fouling especially in the heat of battle where space could be a
        constraint as well as the additional time it would take to load in this
        fashion.</p>
    <p>Among the most noteworthy information concerning firearms are the entries
        and sketches on “hail shot,” a cartridge prepared in paper tubes with
        layers of lead shot or pellets—rather than a single lead ball or
        bullet—separated by wads or patches of cardboard, felt, leather, or
        linen. Of these, the author-practitioner notes, if strong wadding
        material is used, the cartridge “barely scatters &amp; makes for great
        piercing against a door, cuirass body [breastplate] and others” (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/45r/f/45r/tl"><u>45r</u></a>).
        In this statement, the arms race to defeat heavy plate armor with
        improved projectiles is evident. This hail shot was like a modern
        shotgun shell without its self-contained charge of explosive powder;
        instead, the powder charge had to be loaded down the barrel first with
        the hail shot cartridge packed over it. In the instructions for
        producing these cartridges on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/45r/f/45r/tl"><u>45r</u></a>,
        the wooden mandrel for creating the paper tubes as well as the cutter
        for producing the wadding is illustrated in detail and even labeled with
        letters referenced in the text (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/45r/f/45r/tl"><u>45r</u></a>).
    </p>
    <p>Experimentation on whether such shot was indeed effective against
        breastplates and at what ranges would prove a worthy investigation.<a

           id="fnref20"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> From the late sixteenth century
        well into the seventeenth, some breastplates were tested or “proofed” by
        armorers to show whether they could withstand the shot of a pistol,
        arquebus, or larger musket at close range. The dents found to the left
        or right center of various surviving breastplates attest to these
        measures. Some metallurgical scientist-historians, such as Alan
        Williams, have posited that most of these so-called “proof” marks were
        likely the result of undercharging the powder producing a weaker
        explosive force behind the projectile, or even faked altogether, thus
        giving a false impression to wearers and consumers.<a href="#fn21"

    <p>In 2017–18, the Art Institute of Chicago embarked on an experiment to
        reproduce one of the armors in its collection and test it with a .60
        caliber lead ball, modern black powder, and a reproduction matchlock
        musket. The breastplate of the armor was a copy of one produced at the
        royal workshops of Greenwich, England around 1588. It was made of
        smelted medium-carbon steel resulting in a similar metallurgical
        composition to the original.<a href="#fn22"

           role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a> It also closely matched the
        weight of the original within a pound (about 14 pounds total, 6.35
        kilograms) plus an over breastplate, known as a plackart, that added an
        additional “shot-proof” layer weighing an additional ten pounds (4.5
        kilograms). The result of the test, shooting the matchlock musket at
        sixteen yards, produced about a half-inch or 1.2-centimeter dent on the
        outer breastplate and a slight mar to the surface on the inner
        breastplate (<i><u>Fig. 14</u></i>).</p>

    <p>The experiment showed that armor could be effective in stopping a lead
        ball projectile from even the largest of personal firearms—the
        musket—comparable if not more powerful than an arquebus. The reality,
        however, is that not all late sixteenth-century soldiers could afford
        such protection, nor would they necessarily desire to carry the
        requisite weight, the breastplate alone weighing about 20–25 pounds. In
        an extreme case from the period, the Duke de Guise’s siege armor weighs
        in excess of about 88 pounds or 40 kilograms, and has three bullet dents
        on the breastplate (<i><u>Fig. 15</u></i>).</p>

            be very precisely hollowed &amp; adjusted in order that the movement
            may be free. Cuirass bodies must be very evenly beaten &amp; driven

    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>The armor of the Duke de Guise is an
        example of the highest quality custom-made armor available in France at

           id="fnref23"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a> The pauldrons (shoulder
        defenses) and <em>brassard</em> (arm defense or vambrace) are indeed
        “precisely hollowed” with overlapping segments called lames that overlap
        and articulate in such a way that they present minimal gaps between
        them. The plates are generally evenly hammered on this armor, though the
        breastplate is intentionally forged thicker at the front where impact is
        most likely. Strategically, armorers spared weight for where it was most
        practically necessary. As with swords, judging quality relative to
        wealth and social position was important not only for appearance but to
        protect life and limb. Lesser forms of plate armor might be made of
        thinner metal, weigh much less, and be sold in sizes of small, medium,
        or large. These common or munitions pieces of plate armor might protect
        from sword cuts and thrusts and even projectiles from long range, but
        were of little protection from firearms at closer ranges of twenty yards
        or less. Considering the entry in Ms. Fr. 640 on dented gun barrels,
        “cannon” and an imperfect means of adjusting them with a hammer on the
        outside on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/45v/f/45v/tl"><u>45v</u></a>,
        these firearms were not particularly accurate beyond a range of twenty
        or thirty yards, and some much worse than others.<a href="#fn24"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref24"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a> Blanket fire, or gunfire en
        masse, was the more effective means of defense, and consequently the

    <p>Quality in manufacturing processes for armor is commented on in one other
        note after discussing the breastplate on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/32r/f/32r/tl"><u>32r</u></a>,
        mentioning morions, the most common open-faced steel helmet of the
        second half of the sixteenth century: “Morions from&nbsp;Milan&nbsp;are
        all in one piece &amp; thus better than those that are of two” (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/32r/f/32r/tl"><u>32r</u></a>).
        The morion, with its characteristic sweeping brim and rounded comb of
        raised fin-like projection at the top was first produced in two halves
        down the center rather than raised from a single flat billet of steel in
        France around 1550–60.<a href="#fn25"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref25"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a> This method not only allowed
        armorers to produce morions in the French style with higher combs—four
        or five inches (10–13 centimeters) tall—without breaking through and
        overstretching the metal, but also cut down significantly on production
        time. It allowed an armorer to produce several rather than one a day.
        Significantly, the author-practitioner of Ms. Fr. 640 is warning against
        local production, advising the reader to turn to the armor making center
        of Milan, Italy, where morions were extensively exported and generally
        made in one piece throughout the period (<i><u>Fig. 16</u></i>). Without
        a seam running end to end, it is conceivable that one-piece morions
        could better withstand swords and even projectiles.</p>

    <p>Ms. Fr. 640 draws one other connection to the technological arms race
        between firearm projectiles and plate armor: tempering steel. In this
        metalworking technique, iron or steel is heated to red hot allowing
        carbon to be absorbed into the surface, producing a hard-crystalline
        structure when quenched or submerged into water or oil. The result is
        carbon steel. For some applications, quenching might produce a steel
        that is too brittle or hard and so the piece can be tempered, reducing
        some of the hardened carbon crystal structure on the surface, by heating
        it back up to a certain temperature judged by the colors
        straw-to-purple-to-blue-to-grey—as discussed with guards above—and
        allowed to air-cool more slowly. Molecularly, this process was not at
        all understood in the period, and so the text of Ms. Fr. 640 reveals the
        empirical nature of experimentation. An entry entitled “Excellent
        tempering bath for&nbsp;cuirass bodies [breastplates]” (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/56r/f/56r/tl"><u>56r</u></a>)
        includes such ingredients as earth, pigeon dung, and horse dung among
        other organic material to be mixed in water. Presumably, this was the
        water used as the bath for quenching a breastplate after heating it in a
        forge.<a href="#fn26"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref26"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a> This is reminiscent of the
        twelfth-century recipe for quenching steel tools in the urine of a
        red-headed boy from the treatise of the goldsmith-monk Theophilus.
        Whether or not this or other recipes for the quenching bath helped to
        harden the steel is debatable, though the organic material present in
        the water may or may not have had an effect on the subsequent carbon
        absorbed in the steel.<a href="#fn27"

    <p>Experiments to find a better tempered steel were undoubtedly many and
        idiosyncratic from craftsman to craftsman. Surprisingly, the
        author-practitioner gives a recipe for tempering projectiles—addressing
        the other side of the arms race—in an entry on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/55r/f/55r/tl"><u>55r</u></a>,
        “For tempering a ball that will pierce and&nbsp;will make healing
        difficult”: “Mix&nbsp;fat&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;strong vinegar&nbsp;&amp;
        throw your ball very hot into this mixture.” It is not specified if the
        ball or bullet is made of lead or iron. Earlier in the sixteenth century
        it was not uncommon for projectiles to be produced in forged iron, in
        which case an iron bullet could have been case-hardened and tempered
        into steel by quenching in such a liquid. However, if a lead ball was
        intended, as a nonferrous metal this recipe would have had no effect, if
        not melting the ball in the process. Aside from piercing armor, the
        added advantage mentioned of inflicting a worse wound, real or
        perceived, underscores the ominous nature of these materials and the
        culture of conflict at the time of writing.</p>
    <p>Aside from a thriving arms industry, the period of Ms. Fr. 640 was rife
        with changes in battlefield tactics and advancements in firearms. This
        gradual development of weapons and armor underpins the choice of arms
        discussed by the author-practitioner. For example, it is telling that
        plate armor is only given a cursory mention in a few places,
        particularly in regard to firearms.<a href="#fn28"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref28"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a> Armor and the heavy cavalry that
        generally used it was just then in decline. The weight and performance
        of plate armor were steadily giving way due to advances in firearms.
        Thicker plates were required to offset the higher firepower and larger
        charges in muskets or harquebuses, the ranges of which are commented
        upon on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/44r/f/44r/tl"><u>44r</u></a>.<a
           href="#fn29"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref29"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
    <p>The sixteenth-century military—infantry and cavalry—tactics are not
        broached in the text of the manuscript aside from some few comments such
        as the note on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/45r/f/45r/tl"><u>45r</u></a>
        on the use of hail shot intended to damage breastplates. Perhaps the
        author-practitioner was aware of these developing tactics but not
        concerned with recording that type of knowledge. Treatises on warfare
        and the development of tactics were already well published by the
        period, especially in the genre of <em>Kriegsbücher</em> in Germany
        beginning in the late fifteenth century.<a href="#fn30"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref30"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a> Conversely, these treatises on
        warfare and tactics give only passing reference, if any, to the
        production and maintenance of armor and weapons, and are more concerned
        with training and tactics. Against that backdrop, Ms. Fr. 640 becomes an
        important complementary resource.</p>
