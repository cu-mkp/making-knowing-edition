        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <div>
            <p>In an attempt to decipher a puzzling marginal note, “Try burnt
                oysters,” on fol. <a
                   href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/84v/f/84v/tl"><u>84v</u></a>,
                hands-on reconstruction in the laboratory, paired with textual
                research and analysis, opened several avenues for exploration.
                Our findings suggest that the author-practitioner knew or
                speculated about promising properties of oyster shells for
                making sand molds, but had yet to perfect a procedure for their
                successful use. In contrast to other more confidently phrased
                imperatives, such as in “Casting in frames” on fol. <a
                   href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/118v/f/118v/tl"><u>118v</u></a>,
                in which the author-practitioner writes in the first person, on
                fol. <a
                   href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/84v/f/8v4/tl"><u>84v</u></a>
                he offers no tips, warnings, or reminders that would suggest a
                hands-on familiarity with the processes.</p>

    <p>Fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/84v/f/84v/tl"><u>84v</u></a>
        contains four entries, all to do with moldmaking and casting, one of
        which is entitled “<em>Eau magistra</em>” for a binding agent for sand
        molds made from elm roots and wine (which we have explored in the
        research essay, “‘<em>Eau magistra</em>:’ Investigating Binders for Sand
        Molds”).<a href="#fn1"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref1"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> To the left of “<em>Eau
            magistra</em>” sits a marginal note that reads “Try burnt oysters”
        (<em>Essaye huitres bruslees</em>). As it turns out, these three words
        open up many avenues of exploration.</p>
    <p>While this marginal note is written directly to the left of “<em>Eau
            magistra</em>,” it may also belong with the other three marginal
        notes above it on sands for moldmaking and casting. These all belong
        with the entry on “Sand” (<em>Sable</em>), above “<em>Eau
            magistra</em>.” The puzzle of the placement of “burnt oysters”
        cannot be solved by visual inspection alone, and it is further
        compounded by the fact that there are only two other references to
        oysters in Ms. Fr. 640 which also appear as marginal notes. A note on
        fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/80v/f/80v/tl"><u>80v</u></a>
        in the entry “Founders of small works of tin” reads, “Try calcined
        oyster shells. They are said to be excellent for molding..” On fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/49r/f/49r/tl"><u>49r</u></a>,
        next to an entry entitled “Casting of Lead,” another note mentions
        oyster shell, though the meaning is even less clear:</p>
    <p>“Poncet. They cast with solder that <del>pewterers</del>
        <sup>glassworkers</sup> use.</p>
    <p>Lump of iron</p>
    <p>Calcined <del>iron</del> oyster shell.”</p>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>These additional mentions of calcined
        oysters raise the question of what relationship they have to the texts
        they abut? Is it useful to consider these in the light of Michael
        Camille’s work which has called attention to both the value of
        marginalia and the relationship between the author and reader of a
        text?<a href="#fn2"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref2"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> Much recent scholarship explores
        the early modern reader’s interaction with texts by way of notes,
        annotations, and images in marginalia, making clear the diverse
        functions of marginal notes, from directing attention to particular
        sections, to exegesis, to engaging in dialogue with the author.<a
           href="#fn3"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref3"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> However, these discussions of
        authority and mediation do not precisely fit the marginalia of Ms. Fr.
        640 because the author is both reader and writer (and practitioner). In
        this case, the marginalia may reflect a second or later iteration of his
        experiments or a reflection on his experience. Did the
        author-practitioner of Ms. Fr. 640 actually try to work with oyster
        shells, or did he observe someone else perform this technique?<a

        should they be considered an invitation to experiment?<a href="#fn5"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref5"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> If so, this implicitly raises the
        issue of the manuscript’s intended audience. This line of inquiry may
        help shed light on the larger mystery of the author-practitioner’s
        identity and his composition of the text.</p>
    <h2 id="reconstructing-for-meaning">Reconstructing for Meaning</h2>
    <p>To determine the best interpretation of the marginal note “Try burnt
        oysters,” we decided to reconstruct it on the basis of both readings (<i><u>Fig. 1</u></i>).<a
           href="#fn6"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref6"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> Two of the
        references to oyster shells in Ms. Fr. 640 mention calcining
        (<em>calcinee</em>), while the third speaks of burning
        (<em>bruslee</em>). According to Cotgrave’s 1611 French dictionary,
        <em>Calciné</em> is defined as “calcinated, turned into dust, reduced by
        fire, unto pouder” and the verb <em>calciner</em> means “to calcinate,
        burne to dust, reduce unto pouder, by fire, any mettal or minerall.”<a
           href="#fn7"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref7"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> This makes it likely that these
        calcined or burnt oyster shells were being used in making sand molds. No
        further information on the actual process of calcining, except the
        application of fire or heat, can be found in Ms. Fr. 640 or other early
        modern sources. This raised the questions of how the shells should be
        prepared and heated (at what temperature, and for how long?), and how
        the oyster shells would be transformed by this process.</p>

    <p>Ms. Fr. 640 mentions calcination is several places. On fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/100r/f/100r/tl"><u>100r</u></a>
        in “Vitrified saltpeter,” the author-practitioner describes calcining
        other stones, suggesting that different heat sources and processes can
        lead to different levels of purity. In “Molding with cuttlefish bone” on
        fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/91r/f/91r/tl"><u>91r</u></a>,
        a marginal note reads, “When the lead gets too hot, it calcines.” On
        fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/83r/f/83r/tl"><u>83r</u></a>,
        in “Another for lead” (<em>Aultre pour le plomb</em>) about preparing
        molding sand for lead casting, the author directs the reader to “℞
        finely pestled slate &amp; <del>calcined</del> pumice stone, mixed
        together. Calcine them in a well covered pot, &amp; thrice stoppered
        over a good fire, &amp; each time mix them with varnish.” Other
        materials in Ms. Fr. 640 that are calcined include stone, glass, bone,
        and other kinds of shells, for example, on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/92v/f/92v/tl"><u>92v</u></a>
        an entry “Sand from river tellins and mussels” notes that “The long
        shells that one finds in fresh water rivers, being calcined, make an
        impalpable white sand, which molds very neatly.”</p>
    <h2 id="calcining">Calcining</h2>
    <p>Scientific scholarship has studied oyster shells as a problem of shells
        in landfills, as well as their potential antifungal properties. Raw
        oyster shells principally consist of calcium carbonate (CaCO3), while
        calcination of oyster shells yields calcium oxide (CaO). The “optimal
        temperatures for calcination” in one modern calcination experiment was
        900°-950°C (1472°-1562°F).<a href="#fn8"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref8"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> Another experiment exposed oyster
        shells to 1050°C (1922°F) and reported that the resultant powder had
        “turned completely into CaO after the treatment,” and that in order to
        produce this result, the “shell was washed several times and dried in an
        oven at 60°C (140°F) for twenty-four hours.”<a href="#fn9"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref9"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
    <p>To prepare our oyster shells, we boiled them in water and cleaned them by
        removing any remaining adductor muscle.<a href="#fn10"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref10"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> We then removed the barnacles
        and other attached shells with hammers and pliers. After the shells had
        been rinsed in water several times, we contained the shells in a large
        towel and broke them into smaller pieces with a hammer. We attempted the
        calcination several times: the first time, we used a small jewelry kiln
        heated to 1500°F, exposing just a few pieces of shell to the heat.<a
           href="#fn11"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref11"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> After ten minutes, the shells
        had turned to white, very fine ash.<a href="#fn12"

        we were able to produce a crushed oyster ash that was gray in color
        (thus not fully calcined), the shells finally calcined after heating
        them over a 9-hour period, in which they reached a maximum temperature
        of 1800°F for an hour. The resulting powder was pure white, smooth, and
        silky, quite similar in feel to talcum powder. In the pseudonymous
        Alessio Piemontese’s sixteenth-century <em>De Secreti</em>, this kind of
        sand—“very soft, as if impalpable”—is described as perfect for making
        molds in which to cast metal.<a href="#fn14"

           role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> This fully-calcined oyster shell
        powder was the material we used in two experiments: in the first, we
        interpreted the oyster ash as an ingredient in a binding agent used to
        moisten a sand in a making a sand mold; in the second, we used the
        oyster ash as the sand itself.</p>
    <p>In the first process, which produced a decoction of calcined oyster
        shells and wine, we sought to examine the performance of the decoction
        as a binder in comparison to the other binders tested.<a href="#fn15"

        creating the elm root decoction in fol. 84v, “<em>Eau magistra</em>,” we
        boiled two teaspoons of calcined oyster shells with one cup of
        inexpensive Cabernet Sauvignon on a hot plate. Upon contact with the
        wine, the powder immediately turned a teal green, then briefly became a
        clear emerald green, which then transitioned into a dull, opaque olive
        green. More research is needed to determine if the dramatic color
        changes were due to an oxidation reaction (<i><u>Fig. 2</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 3</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 4</u></i>). We poured the mixture into
        an airtight glass container. After a few minutes, the mixture separated
        into a watery brown liquid on top and a muddy green mixture on the
        bottom. A half cup of this decoction was then added to two cups of
        sifted sand and used for making sand molds.</p>

    <p>In preparing our sand for molds, we pulverized and sifted previously used
        molds made of a 2:1 mixture of plaster and pulverised bricks. After
        stirring the oyster ash and wine decoction, we gradually added
        approximately half a cup of it to two cups of sifted sand. It was easy
        to achieve the desired texture for sand molds; the mixture would hold
        together when squeezed into the palm of the hand, but broke apart with
        the pressure of a fingertip (<i><u>Fig. 5</u></i>).<a href="#fn16"

        only be used once (<i><u>Fig. 8</u></i>).  Our test of this entry

    <p>In our second experiment, we used the sifted calcined oyster shells as
        the sand. Two cups of calcined oyster shells were mixed with the whipped
        egg whites of two eggs. This did not seem to moisten the oyster shell
        sand sufficiently; the sand seemed to absorb the moisture much more
        quickly that the brick dust molds—it would not “clump” enough to be a
        useful packed mold material. Since we ran out of eggs in the lab, we
        used some of the remaining elm root emulsion we had on hand.<a

        exothermic reaction that occurred when the lime present in the CaO
        reacted with moisture from the air resulted in a mold that “puffed up”
        and disintegrated. The heat of the exothermic reaction melted and

    <p>In retrospect, the success of our first experiment of using oyster ash as
        a liquid binder for sand molding might have been a result of the fine
        oyster ash mixing with the brick dust and plaster of pulverized molds
        from previous castings. This could have produced a finer sand that could
        take a better impression. The manuscript does not say explicitly to mix
        the oyster shells with another sand, but this was part of the successful
        molding material. The reaction that produced the brilliant green color
        in the wine perhaps holds the key to the success of the experiment. The
        calcined oyster shells had already been exposed to moisture, so they had
        already undergone a reaction. Meanwhile, the wine still acted as a
        binding agent in the mold.<a href="#fn20"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref20"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> It would be interesting to
        determine if the oyster ash that produced the exothermic reaction could
        be used again as a sand in a box mold; perhaps this sand would be
        capable of hardening and maintaining an impression in which to cast
        metal. Further experimentation with oyster shell ash is worth pursuing.

    <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>A hands-on approach in the laboratory, paired with textual research and
        analysis enabled us to explore the ways in which the oyster marginalia
        might illuminate the compilation of the text and the
        author-practitioner’s role as both writer and reader of his own text.
        Our findings suggest that the author-practitioner knew or speculated
        about the promising properties of oyster shells, but he had yet to
        perfect a procedure for their successful use. The presence of distancing
        language, phrases such as “try” or “it is said to be” indicate that the
        author-practitioner was probably less personally familiar with the use
        of oyster shells as a material. Perhaps he heard it suggested, or had
        observed the properties of calcined oyster shells in another context.
        But in contrast to other more confidently phrased imperatives, such as
        in “Casting in frames” on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/118v/f/118v/tl"><u>118v</u></a>,
        in which the author-practitioner writes in the first person, on fol. 84v
        he offers no tips, warnings, or reminders that would suggest a hands-on
        familiarity with the processes. Perhaps these notes were untested by the
        author-practitioner and instead intended as suggestions for future
        experiments, as is perhaps the case with a list of processes on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/169r/f/169r/tl"><u>169r</u></a>,
        where the author-practitioner lists many processes, appearing to mark
        those he has “put” (<em>mis</em>), or even “put and seen” (<em>mis et
            veu</em>), perhaps indicating those he has actually observed or
        tried and included in the manuscript, and those he may “try” in the
        future.</p>

                    with ingredients and procedures, substituting ingredients,
                    changing the amounts specified, and even pronouncing them
                    useless in their experiments found them so.” William Eamon,
