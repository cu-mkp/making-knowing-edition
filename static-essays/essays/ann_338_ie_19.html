        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <div>
            <p>Toulouse has long been an attractive city for goldsmiths. The
                author-practitioner of Ms. Fr. 640, who owned a goldsmith's
                forge (fol. <a
                   href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/12v/f/12v/tl"><u>12v</u></a>)
                and made multiple references to goldsmithing in the entries of
                his manuscript, was probably in contact with several masters
                from Toulouse. This profile resembles that of the merchant and
                goldsmith Raymond Masse. Active in Toulouse from 1585 to 1631,
                Masse’s activity, collaborations and relationships, both on a
                local and international level, bear many similarities with the
                concerns of the author-practitioner and shed light on several
                passages of the manuscript. Cliquez ici pour la version

    <p>As early as the fifteenth century, Toulouse began to attract goldsmiths,
        owing to its ardent Catholicism, its many religious sites, its
        celebrated relics, and the power of its clergy and lay brotherhoods.<a

        particularly renowned in the Midi region around Toulouse.</p>
    <p>One of them, Raymond Masse, was active from 1585 to 1631, and his
        business can be related to several references and concerns in Ms. Fr.
        640. It is therefore tempting to speculate that Masse was in touch with
        the author-practitioner, who was interested in goldsmithing and used a
        goldsmith’s forge of his own (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/12v/f/12v/tl"><u>12v</u></a>).
        In 1585, Masse became a master goldsmith, but he quickly turned to trade
        and undoubtedly enjoyed financial success, considering his connections,
        his businesses, and his influential clients.<a href="#fn2"

    <p>At the onset of the seventeenth century, two journeymen, Jean Coste and

    <p>Raymond Masse also surrounded himself with foreign journeymen like

        of Cahors. He offered to sell it to Raymond Masse and they agreed on the
        price of 100 gold <em>écus</em>. Masse promised to buy it on the sole
        condition that the stone be removed “from its setting” and assessed
        “without delay” by the members of his shop. One of them, Jean Caillou,
        was master goldsmith of the city.<a href="#fn8"

        and journeymen alike, assessed its quality. The deal fell through
        because “the said stone was not a ruby […] but only a doublet.”</p>

    </h2>
    <p>Throughout his career, Raymond Masse was in touch with Parisian
        goldsmiths. He sometimes travelled to Paris, at least during the first
        decade of the seventeenth century, to meet with the Targier brothers,
        two powerful bourgeois merchants and business associates to whom he owed
        large sums of money.<a href="#fn9"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref9"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
    <p>Being quite well-off, Raymond Masse helped his colleagues and regularly
        lent them money. In 1604, he assisted Richard Richaudeau, a Parisian
        goldsmith “suffering from some bodily ailment,” bedridden in the upper
        room of his home.<a href="#fn10"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref10"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> It seems that, in Paris, Masse’s
        confidential agent was the goldsmith François Audry. He was sometimes
        charged with collecting the money owed to the Toulouse artisan.<a
           href="#fn11"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref11"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> Both men also had business
        links. In 1610, Masse sent Audry “three cast gold ingots weighing
        [nearly] 22 ounces, with a bundle of letters.”<a href="#fn12"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref12"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
    <p>These links were not unique to the Masse family: in the 1600s, the
        Toulouse goldsmith Pierre Lefèvre settled in Paris where his
        brother-in-law, Monsieur Faguier, was a surgeon.<a href="#fn13"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref13"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> Lefèvre had previously taken on
        as “a servant to the said state of goldsmith” Baptiste de Fréchain, a
        journeyman from Paris. This illustrates the willingness to move that was
        inherent to apprenticeship, as well as the job opportunities offered by
        Toulouse.<a href="#fn14"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref14"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
    <p>These points show that the references to the three Parisian masters on
        the first folio of Ms. Fr. 640 should perhaps not be surprising. The
        political, artistic, and literary links between the kingdom’s capital
        and Toulouse were both intensive and constant throughout the
        Renaissance.</p>
    <h2 id="the-emeralds-of-brissac-fol.-2v">The “Emeralds of Brissac” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/2v/f/2v/tl"><u>2v</u></a>)
    </h2>
    <p>Other of Raymond Masse’s business relations can shed light on some
        entries in Ms. Fr. 640. It is attested that Masse was surrounded with
        German and Flemish fellow workers, and that he travelled “to traffic in
        Spain and purchase merchandise for his work as a goldsmith” in 1593 with
        his brother François, also a goldsmith (doc. 1547–†1616). His business
        also led him to turn to Switzerland.</p>
    <p>In November 1603, Antoine Jean, a “<em>merchant lapidaire de Brissac en
            Suisse</em>” (gem merchant from Brissac in Switzerland), appointed
        his servant Jean de Lisle as his proxy to recover:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>each of the sums and parts of moneys which are, may, or will be owed
            to the said constituent in the land and kingdom of France by any
            persons whoever they may be, be it for the sale of merchandise, the
            loan money, or otherwise.<a href="#fn15"
               class="footnote-ref"
               id="fnref15"
               role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>Raymond Masse gave him one-hundred and
        sixty-two <em>livres</em> for the purchase of twenty-seven turquoises
        and sixty-five dozen “small white crystal square cut stones.”</p>
    <p>Masse was not the only goldsmith in the city to be in touch with the
        Swiss gem merchant’s servant. In 1605, Pierre Lefèvre promised to pay
        eighty-one <em>livres</em> to Jean de Lisle, gem merchant from Geneva,
        “for the sale of certain stones used for goldsmithing.”<a href="#fn16"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref16"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> The money was to be remitted to
        a merchant-goldsmith from Lyon, Marc Perachon, two months later. In
        1606, the gem merchant Jean de Lisle, acting as Antoine Jean’s servant,
        delivered the sum of eleven <em>écus</em> owed by two goldsmiths from
        Agen, Jean Barthe and Pierre Probas, to the Toulouse goldsmith Daniel
        Thomas.<a href="#fn17"

           id="fnref17"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
    <p>These privileged commercial ties developed little by little from Paris to
        Switzerland via the central trade node of Lyon. All through the
        sixteenth century up to the early seventeenth century, this former
        capital of the Gauls sponsored fairs which brought merchants from
        France, Castille, Aragon, Germany, and all over Europe. These merchants,
        including goldsmiths, bought, sold, and settled their debts.<a
           href="#fn18"

           role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> The ties between Toulouse

        640.</p>
    <h2 id="the-blanques">The <em>Blanques</em></h2>
    <p>One of Raymond Masse’s more lucrative activities was the
        <em>blanque</em>, a type of lottery invented by the Italians that,
        according to Étienne Pasquier, was the “game most suited that one could
        imagine to discreetly cheat the rabble,” usually being played during
        fairs.<a href="#fn19"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref19"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a> If the <em>blanque</em> appears,
        in Pasquier’s words, to be one of the “subtle means [of extorting] gold
        and silver out of France,” a topic already mentioned by Jean Prévost
        about sleight of hand, it was in reality controlled and monitored.
        Played in various ways, this game of chance consisted in selling
        hundreds or even thousands of tickets enclosed in a box, several days in
        a row. The losing tickets were white (<em>blanc</em>), hence the name of
        the lottery, while a small proportion of black ones entitled their
        purchasers to prizes such as jewelry, paintings, and woodwork, of
        various values, which were listed in a register and exhibited.</p>
    <p>These lotteries spread throughout Europe in the sixteenth century.<a
           href="#fn20"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref20"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> First created to fund public
        works, they also depended on private investors expecting profitable
        returns. They fostered the circulation of works of art, luxurious and
        simple, including gold plate, jewelry, precious stones, mirrors,
        paintings, and even weapons. These lotteries gave craftspeople like
        Raymond Masse the opportunity to sell their merchandise and offered
        ticket buyers the chance to win prestigious and desirable objects.
        Interestingly, Ms. Fr. 640 mentions most of these objects. Moreover, in
        the early seventeenth century, Pierre de Brun, a Flemish merchant with a
        royal license, organized such a lottery in Toulouse.<a href="#fn21"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref21"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
    <p>The <em>blanques</em> held in Pézenas, near Montpellier, gave Masse the
        opportunity to team up with one of the more renowned painters of the
        city, Jacques Boulbène (doc. 1575–1576; 1586–†1605), who worked for the
        <em>capitouls</em> on numerous occasions in the late sixteenth
        century.<a href="#fn22"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref22"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a> In August 1601, Raymond Masse
        drew up a contract to share the gains linked to the sale of “certain
        merchandises of goldsmithing and painting” with the painters Pierre
        Delon and Jacques Boulbène, and the goldsmith Arnaud Cornayre.<a
           href="#fn23"

        professional, political, and economic aspects of these lotteries with
        the entries in Ms. Fr. 640.</p>
    <p>Another connection to the entries of Ms. Fr. 640 is a document dated
        August 31, 1609, which shows evidence of a direct link between Raymond
        Masse and the d’Ouvrier family and highlights the financial benefit that
        could be reaped from their relationship with the merchant-goldsmith.<a

        Jean Bobelièvre, from Toulouse, and Maturin Rouaut, a native of Amboise.
        The two men owed 5,642 <em>livres</em>:</p>
    <blockquote>

            adorned with silver and painted decorations, 12 dozen pearl buttons,

    <h2 id="masses-customers">Masse’s Customers</h2>
    <p>The last facet of Raymond Masse’s career relevant to Ms. Fr. 640 concerns
        his social standing in Toulouse and the high status of his customers. A
        variety of documents reveal his ties with the social elite, his position
        of having valuable gold or silverware at his disposal, and his ability
        to borrow large sums of money. In 1604, Jean Antoine de Montpezat, baron
        of Ganac and <em>gentilhomme ordinaire de la chambre du roi</em>,
        acknowledged a debt of 2,500 <em>livres</em> to Raymond Masse, “for the
        sale and delivery of a necklace with brilliants and 125 diamonds, and a
        gold chain adorned with engraved and enameled pearls.”<a href="#fn27"

    <p>Masse’s reputation as a respectable citizen is quite obvious in the part
        he played in 1610 as a witness to the purchase of a commission of
        councilor, signed by the widow of Jean de Pins, Souveraine de Portal,
        and Jean de Senaulx, for 10,500 <em>livres.</em><a href="#fn30"

    <p>Lastly, Masse worked for the Béthune family. Philippe’s niece, Louise,
        married in 1620 to Alexandre de Lévis, baron of Mirepoix, placed an
        order with Raymond Masse in 1625, through Claude Valentin, the Duke of
        Sully’s secretary, for the making of “two imitation faceted sapphires,
        one white and the other green, to be set on picks and worn in the
        hair.”<a href="#fn32"

    <p>Raymond Masse’s shop, his businesses, and his connections illustrate the
        social role, the vitality, as well the scope and variety of activities
        that a merchant-goldsmith could aspire to in Toulouse at the end of the
        Renaissance. His field of expertise and his working connections
        intersect with many of the author-practitioner’s concerns.</p>
