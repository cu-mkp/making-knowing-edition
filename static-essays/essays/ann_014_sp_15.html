        describes in detail the process for making stone molds and casting metal
        into them. Stone mold making and casting, like cuttlefish bone casting,
        does not receive as much attention from the author-practitioner of Ms.
        Fr. 640 as other forms of casting such as sand mold casting and
        lifecasting (carried out in plaster molds, regarded by the
        author-practitioner as a form of sand mold). Stone mold casting is
        alluded to a few times in the manuscript, but only fol. 80v contains
        instructions for the technique of making the mold.<a href="#fn1"

        hundred sand mold making and casting recipes in the manuscript. Despite
        being the only set of instructions for stone mold making in the
        manuscript, the recipe is richly detailed. It describes a mold making
        and casting process used to produce tin and lead pilgrim badges in large
        numbers, a procedure for which few comparable contemporary written
        sources exist. This essay describes our attempts to reconstruct and
        document the stone mold making and casting technique described in Ms.

    <h2 id="stone-mold-carving">Stone Mold Carving</h2>
    <p>If, as seems likely, the author-practitioner collected the stone mold
        making information from practitioners, this oral tradition might help
        explain the lack of recipes in other technical writings. Cennino Cennini
        (ca. 1360– before 1427), writing at the end of the fourteenth century,
        gives instructions on how to mold tin foil with stone molds in <em>Il
            libro dell’arte</em>, but these directions bear little resemblance
        to the technique described in Ms. Fr. 640<em>.</em><a href="#fn6"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref6"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> In his sixteenth-century treatise
        <em>Pirotechnia</em>, Vannoccio Biringuccio (ca. 1480–ca. 1539) writes,
        “indeed, [tin] is an easily melted metal, in common use for the utensils
        which are made for human needs, it is an art known not only to skilled
        men but almost to children, wherefore I could proceed without telling of
        it.”<a href="#fn7"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref7"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> As Biringuccio notes, casting
        metal objects in stone molds was a relatively simple process. First, the
        practitioner sought out stones of the best consistency to make their
        carving. This means they should be “close-grained,” without large
        inclusions of differing hardness.<a href="#fn8"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref8"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> Once two stones of adequate
        density were found, they were ground down, perhaps one against the
        other, or on a flat surface, until they fit tightly together (a stone
        used for an open-face mold did not require grinding). Using a pointed
        tool made from a hard metal, such as iron, the practitioner then carved
        a design into the stone as well as a venting and gate system, applied a
        separating agent, and then joined the stones together. Finally, the
        molder poured molten metal, typically a mixture of tin and lead, into
        the mold and, once the metal had cooled, separated the stones, and
        removed the object.</p>
    <h2 id="reconstruction">Reconstruction</h2>
    <p>Thus, the first step in reconstructing this process was selecting
        appropriate stones.<a href="#fn9"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref9"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> The author-practitioner writes:

    <blockquote>

    <p>In order to determine what type of stone to use in our reconstruction, we
        had to follow the author-practitioner’s approach and consider stones by
        their material properties rather than by their modern classifications.
        He specifies that the stones used by tin founders are those “of which
        are made the sharpening stones or files of barbers, which are found in
        great flakes near the mountains, &amp; resemble slate” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/80v/f/80v/tl"><u>80v</u></a>).
        The comparison with the materials used for sharpening blades suggests
        that these stones had a highly uniform texture. And, “close-grained...
        [and] fine-grained” medieval stone molds do exist.<a href="#fn12"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref12"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> We originally intended to use
        slate since the author-practitioner specifically mentions that the
        stones he used resembled slate. The slate samples we obtained displayed
        a uniform texture and density throughout, however, they proved
        impossible to use because of their awkward shape. Based upon these
        observations of grain, we decided to use two types of common stone with
        the finest texture we could find, namely, limestone and soapstone,
        although limestone is much more granular than soapstone (<i><u>Fig. 6</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 7</u></i>).</p>

    <p>As inexpert stone carvers, we soon discovered that stone is hard,
        especially when we attempted to carve precise details. At first, our
        progress was slow, especially with the limestone. It took us over three
        hours to complete the relatively simple design we chose for this type of
        stone, using various files, chisels, and brushes (<i><u>Fig. 9</u></i>,
        <i><u>Fig. 10</u></i>). This was partially due to our novice skill
        level, but the hardness of the stone was also a factor. Achieving cuts
        with any depth in the stone required patience and force. Early modern
        artisans, as the author-practitioner writes, used specific instruments
        to do this work: “with a little compass &amp; little matching iron
        fittings, they engrave their figures” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/80v/f/80v/tl"><u>80v</u></a>).
        Sixteenth-century compasses and calipers were precision instruments.<a

        high degree of artisanal skill are found in museum collections (<i><u>Fig. 11</u></i>), many stone molds are relatively simple,
        indicating that the hardness of the stone may have been a limiting
        factor then, too (<i><u>Fig. 12</u></i>).</p>

    <p>We also used distilled vinegar in our attempts to carve, as the
        author-practitioner suggests in a marginal note on fol. 80v: “Try to
        etch with distilled vinegar.” The vinegar made the limestone easier to
        carve, but we did not notice much difference when we used it with
        soapstone. Limestone undergoes a chemical reaction with vinegar, and it
        may be that the resulting dissolution of the stone facilitates carving.
        If this is the case, it would suggest that the stone described in the
        recipe was likely limestone or a stone chemically similar (<i><u>Fig. 13</u></i>).<a href="#fn15"

    <p>Vinegar is used frequently throughout Ms. Fr. 640. In “Counterfeit coral”

        rinsing the mouth with vinegar is advised to neutralize dangerous vapors

        vinegar is used to temper glue. Vinegar is clearly an important material
        in the workshop, and, within his material imaginary, the
        author-practitioner seems to have regarded it as an agent that could
        temper and ameliorate other substances.<a href="#fn16"

    <p>Once we finished carving our designs in the limestone with vinegar, we
        drilled plugholes with a drill and filled them with tin-lead alloy. The
        metal forms natural posts which ensure proper alignment and enable
        repeated use of the molds (<i><u>Fig. 14</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 15</u></i>,
        <i><u>Fig. 16</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 17</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 18</u></i>). We
        ensured that the posts could easily release from their recesses, again
        following the advice of the author-practitioner on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/80v/f/80v/tl"><u>80v</u></a>:
        “Make sure the pegs of your frame enter easily so that <del>in opening
        </del> the frame will easily open without shifting anything, and that
        your frames fit well together, &amp; the table is quite even.” Most
        extant molds in modern museum collections have lost their posts, leaving
        only the holes as evidence of a two-piece mold construction, as in the
        pilgrim badge mold shown in Fig. 12. The jewelry mold shown in Fig. 3
        retains its posts.</p>

    <p>To the soapstone mold, we also added an extraction hole, as described in
        the manuscript: “They pierce a hole in some place on the medal that is
        least visible. And then with a borer they pierce the mold on the side of
        the medal. And if they want their work to stay pierced in any place,
        they drive in a bit of cork at this place in the mold. And the lead or
        tin will not attach to it” (<i><u>Fig. 19</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 20</u></i>). Generally, the extraction hole worked well—the cork was only slightly
        singed, and it greatly aided the release of the metal. The use of an
        extraction hole seems like a very specific detail, suggesting that the
        author-practitioner likely practiced stone making and casting himself
        and appreciated the tricks of the stone molder’s trade.</p>

        with a brush (<i><u>Fig. 21</u></i>,<i><u>Fig. 22</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 23</u></i>). The heat from the mold melted the tallow, “which

    <p>Our next step was to select the separators. The author-practitioner
        specifies two different materials to be used as powdered separators in
        the recipe: quicklime and calcined oyster shells. The quicklime is
        mentioned in the main body of the recipe: “then, taking fine powder of
        quicklime in a linen, they pounce the mold while beating with the linen
        on top, then blow a little on top to prevent it from becoming porous.”
        This observation may represent the recipe as collected from tin founders
        or pewterers. The calcined oyster shells are mentioned in a marginal
        note “Try calcined oyster shells. They are said to be excellent for
        molding,” which the author-practitioner likely added after the main
        recipe was written, perhaps as a note to himself or after collecting
        further information.<a href="#fn17"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref17"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> Both recommendations for
        separation materials appear to be collected from other sources rather
        than originating from the author-practitioner’s own experience. After
        considering the author-practitioner’s suggestions and reflecting on our
        own prior experience of casting with sand molds, we decided to conduct
        the experiment with three different separators (charcoal, quicklime, and

    <p>To fully evaluate the differences between the quality of the casts
        produced using different separators, we first had to understand exactly
        what a good cast meant for the author-practitioner. He often praises
        molds for being of good or easy “release,” for example, in “Pewterer” on
        fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/30r/f/30r/tl"><u>30r</u></a>.
        Further, on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/49r/f/49r/tl"><u>49r</u></a>,
        in “Casting of lead,” he refers to “very neat lead casts.” We therefore
        concluded that the author-practitioner aimed for the metal releasing
        easily from the mold (which would preserve the mold for repeated use)
        and the cast object taking on the precise detail of the impression in
        the mold with minimal loss. By these standards, charcoal was the least
        effective of the three separators (<i><u>Fig. 28</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 29</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 30</u></i>). It left a grainy texture
        over the entire surface of the badge, more than the other separators.
        Pieces of charcoal became embedded in the metal itself and were still
        present even after repeated cleanings, giving the metal a dark hue.<a
           href="#fn20"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref20"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> It was also associated with the
        largest failure of all the pourings, where over half of one mold failed
        to fill at all (<i><u>Fig. 31</u></i>).<a href="#fn21"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref21"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a> By contrast, the quicklime and
        calcined oyster shells both performed well. These separators made the
        metal appear brighter and smoother than that with the charcoal. In all
        cases—charcoal, quicklime, and calcined oyster shells—the metal released
        easily from the molds, and the molds were left undamaged, ready to be
        used again.</p>

    <p>Our reconstruction of the stone mold technique found in Ms. Fr. 640 is by
        no means comprehensive. Many questions remain, such as how different
        stones and metal alloy types might affect the process. In addition, more
        research is needed on the trade and social status of pewterers.
        Nonetheless, this recipe adds an unusually detailed description to the
        extant primary sources on stone molds. Its singular appearance in Ms.
        Fr. 640 may reveal the author-practitioner’s relative lack of interest
        in a process of molding that did not involve changing the state of the
        materials (by mixing different sands and binders) and that resulted in
        simple and static forms—as opposed to the lifelike nature casts, on
        which, in other recipes, we see him working so intensively.</p>

                    In <em>The Book of the Secrets of Alchemy</em>, Constantine
                    of Pisa instructs the reader on the tempering qualities of
                    vinegar in several instances: “take quicksilver and boil it
                    in a pan with vinegar and salt, which will purify it of its
                    blackness,” “the mercury should be washed by cooking it in
                    vinegar in which sal ammoniac has been dissolved, boiling it
                    for one day,” and “kill the mercury with vinegar and white
                    lead in a mortar.” See Constantine of Pisa, <em>The Book of
                        the Secrets of Alchemy</em>, ed. and trans. Barbara
                    Obrist (Leiden: E. J. Brill. 1990), 277, 281, 292.
                    Theophilus describes vinegar as a tempering agent: “When
                    [the ashes and the blood of a red-haired man] have been
                    compounded, they are tempered with sharp vinegar in a clean
                    pot.” See Theophilus, <em>On Divers Arts</em>, trans. John
                    G. Hawthorne and Cyril Stanley Smith (New York: Dover,

                    After pouring the metals, we tested the excess quicklime and
