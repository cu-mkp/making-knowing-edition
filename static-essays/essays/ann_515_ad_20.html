            <p>Five entries on fol. <a

                of Ms. Fr. 640 offer instructions for dyeing wood, without
                detailing the type of wood in question or the use to which the
                dyed wood is to be put. These entries are part of a larger
                cluster on the coloring of wood, bone, and horn that spans fols.
                73r to 79r. This essay reconstructs the recipes for dyeing wood
                red and green, and it situates them in the context of wood inlay
                and marquetry, decorative techniques in vogue in early modern
                Europe.</p>

    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
    <p>A cluster of entries in Ms. Fr. 640 on techniques for coloring wood
        starts on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/73r/f/73r/tl"><u>73r</u></a>
        and ends about halfway down fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/79r/f/79r/tl"><u>79r</u></a>.
        The recipes in the section include dyes for coloring wood, bone, and
        horn, colored varnishes to use on wood and other surfaces, various
        techniques for coloring metals, colored “gums” (<em>goume</em>) made
        from wax and resin, and <em>goumiche</em> (seemingly a colored glue),
        methods to gild wood and other materials, as well as a few pigment
        recipes, including one for vermilion and an unusual recipe for making
        “very beautiful color of gold &amp; of little expense” that calls for
        mixing grated orange peel with sulfur.<a href="#fn1"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref1"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> Interestingly, except for three
        entries on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/77r/f/77r/tl"><u>77r</u></a>,
        this entire section is written in a scribal hand—Hand D—in contrast to
        most of the rest of Ms. Fr. 640. The recipes in this section are very
        clean, containing almost no deletions, interlinear additions, or
        marginal comments. This hand also appears sporadically on fols. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/57r/f/57r/tl"><u>57r</u></a>–<a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/58r/f/58r/tl"><u>58r</u></a>.
        In both sections where this hand occurs, the scribe seems to have been
        uncertain about some terms: on fols. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/57v/f/57v/tl"><u>57v</u></a>,
        <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/58r/f/58r/tl"><u>58r</u></a>,
        <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/73r/f/73r/tl"><u>73r</u></a>,
        <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/75v/f/75v/tl"><u>75v</u></a>,
        and <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/79r/f/79r/tl"><u>79r</u></a>,
        he left gaps for words presumably to be inserted (with one term inserted
        in a different hand on fol. 73r), and on fols. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/77v/f/77v/tl"><u>77v</u></a>,
        <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/78r/f/78r/tl"><u>78r</u></a>,
        and <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/79v/f/79v/tl"><u>79v</u></a>,
        the scribe clearly had trouble with the word <em>sandarac</em>. He made
        a couple of tries, writing <em>Sang de Rai</em> and <em>Sang da Rag</em>
        which was then corrected in a different hand (probably that of the
        author-practitioner) to <em>Sang Da Rac</em> (and <em>Sangdarac</em> on
        fol. 79v). On fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/78r/f/78r/tl"><u>78r</u></a>,
        the scribe also wrote <em>trois</em> (three) for <em>bois</em> (wood).
    </p>
    <p>These scribal mistakes indicate that these recipes were almost certainly
        taken down by dictation rather than by copying from another source. The
        gaps and mistaken terms might have been caused by the scribe taking
        dictation in a noisy workshop environment or by a general unfamiliarity
        with common materials such as sandarac. It is hard to guess what might
        be the import of this somewhat unified section of Ms. Fr. 640 being
        written down by a scribe, thus this essay leaves aside speculation about
        this point. Instead, it discusses possible uses for the dyed woods and
        gives an account of reconstructing some of the recipes on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/76r/f/76r/tl"><u>76r</u></a>
        for coloring wood.</p>
    <h2 id="intarsia">Intarsia</h2>
    <p>By the late sixteenth century when Ms. Fr. 640 was compiled,
        sophisticated forms of inlay work employing artificially colored
        materials were common throughout Europe. While woodworkers had used the
        natural shades of various woods to produce inlay art since antiquity, by
        the late fifteenth century, artisans in Italy began to experiment with
        dyes and stains to obtain new chromatic effects or to imitate the
        appearance of expensive or otherwise difficult to obtain woods.<a
           href="#fn2"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref2"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> Concerning the masterful intarsia
        work of Fra Damiano da Bergamo in the sixteenth century, Sabba
        Castiglione wrote, “I even think that the colours of these woods are
        more vivid, brilliant, and beautiful than those used by painters, so
        that these most excellent works may be considered as a new style of
        painting without colours… [by] dyeing woods in any colour that you may
        wish, and in imitation of spotted and marbled stones” (<i><u>Fig. 1</u></i>).<a href="#fn3"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref3"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> In 1568, Giorgio Vasari expressed
        a similar sentiment regarding the highly pictorial intarsia work of his
        time in the preface to <em>Lives of the Most Eminent Painters,
            Sculptors, and Architects</em>, stating that “the art of inlaying
        and making pictures with coloured woods… is painting.”<a href="#fn4"

        so-called Eglantine Table, ca. 1567, originally from Hardwick Hall,
        Derbyshire, England, show how the combination of natural and colored
        woods could produce complex, naturalistic depictions of scenery and

    <p>These and other “paintings in wood” provide a historical material context
        for this essay’s reconstruction of two recipes for coloring wood on fol.
        76r.</p>
    <h2 id="coloring-wood">Coloring Wood</h2>
    <p>In the loosely related recipes stretching from fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/73r/f/73r/tl"><u>73r</u></a>
        to <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/79r/f/79r/tl"><u>79r</u></a>,
        several recipes contain instructions for coloring wood, bone, and
        horn—materials that were used in inlay work. These recipes give no hint,
        however, of any purpose or use for these colored materials. As in other
        entries in Ms. Fr. 640, many of these recipes are brief, containing no
        information on types of wood to use, nor on how to prepare it for
        coloring. Among the larger group of recipes, five on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/76r/f/76r/tl"><u>76r</u></a>
        make up a unified series on coloring wood. Beginning with a method “For
        making wood green,” all recipes in the sequence use the same protocols
        for mixing, heating, soaking, and boiling established in the first
        entry, with ingredients and proportions varying according to the
        different colors being produced (red, blue, violet, yellow).</p>
    <p>Although the use of artificially colored woods in intarsia was
        increasingly common in the sixteenth century, there is little textual
        documentation of the ingredients and procedures used in dyeing from this
        period. Even as late as 1774, nearly three centuries after Fra Damiano
        began coloring woods for his intarsia, André-Jacob Roubo recorded that
        artisans and workshops tended to keep their methods of dyeing secret,
        and as a result the quality and visual properties of finished products
        varied widely according to the place of production.<a href="#fn6"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref6"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> It is thus not surprising that
        early recipe collections, such as the manuscripts of Jehan Le Begue
        (compiled ca. 1431) or the Brussels Manuscript (1635), contain only a
        few recipes for coloring wood, bone, and horn.<a href="#fn7"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref7"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> Conservators have remarked,
        however, that recipes for dyeing woods are often similar to those for
        dyeing textiles and may have been developed by artisans in the textile
        industry.<a href="#fn8"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref8"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> The use of textile dye methods
        may help account for the lack of wood dyeing recipes before the
        eighteenth century.</p>
    <h2 id="reconstruction">Reconstruction</h2>
    <p>The first challenge I faced was the type of wood to source for the
        reconstruction.<a href="#fn9"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref9"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> The author-practitioner makes no
        mention of it, and objects in museum collections are often of little
        help, as a single article of elaborate inlay might contain many distinct
        species of wood, hence many catalog entries for marquetry furniture
        simply record the materials as “various woods.” Beyond the difficulty of
        identifying wood species, the visual and material properties of veneers
        produced from the same log would vary as a result of the method of
        manufacture (e.g., sawing thicknesses and cutting angles) as well as
        post-cutting treatments. According to furniture curator Pierre Ramond,
        wood veneers were exclusively produced by skilled workers using large
        frame saws to cut sheets as thin as 1–2 mm until the nineteenth century,
        but, with the advent of industrialization, new mechanized methods such
        as slicing or rotary cutting came into wide use.<a href="#fn10"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref10"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> These new manufacturing methods
        allowed for quicker sheet production; however, they also required
        extensive pre- and post-treatments, including steaming or boiling logs
        for varying lengths of time according to the hardness of the wood as
        well as open air or kiln drying after cutting. The sawed veneers of the
        sixteenth century required no such treatments, and they are still
        considered to be of superior quality because the natural color and fiber
        of the wood has not been altered by the treatments.<a href="#fn11"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref11"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> Due to lower manufacturing costs
        and faster production times, the majority of veneers produced today are
        sliced or rotary cut. In addition, modern treatment methods of steaming,
        drying, and seasoning cause changes in the levels of tannic acids in the
        wood that can affect the dyeing process.</p>
    <p>For the purpose of my reconstruction, I used three different hardwoods
        commonly used in marquetry and furniture making, all varying in hardness
        and natural lightness of color: basswood (also called lindenwood),
        mahogany, and cherry, with all sheets cut to a thickness of 1/16”
        (roughly 1.6 mm). I assume the sheets were manufactured according to
        modern methods, and thus quite different from those of the sixteenth
        century.</p>
    <p>After sanding the veneers (<i><u>Fig. 4</u></i>), I considered how to
        prepare the wood for the dye bath, as the author-practitioner gives no
        direction on this. Conservators Maarten van Bommel and Enrica Fantini,
        in their attempts to recreate early synthetic dyes from the nineteenth
        century, note that the acidity and porosity of wood will affect the
        final dye result; therefore, they soaked their woods in either plain
        water, a solution of 5% ammonia, or salt water.<a href="#fn12"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref12"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> With this in mind, I divided
        each type of wood into two groups and soaked one group in water for a
        period of 48 hours before dyeing and left the other group dry to be
        added to the dye bath (<i><u>Fig. 5</u></i>). For woods being dyed
        before nineteenth-century methods of manufacture, one probably would
        have followed instructions such as those of William Salmon’s 1675
        publication, <em>Polygraphice</em>, that instructs to boil in alum water
        all materials to be dyed, or Godfrey Smith’s 1770s compilation, <em>The
            Laboratory, or, School of the Arts</em>, which directs that “the
        wood is first to be thoroughly soaked in alum water.”<a href="#fn13"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref13"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> After soaking half the wood for
        48 hours in water, I briefly wiped them down and allowed the excess
        water to absorb on a paper towel about 30 minutes before adding dye.</p>

    <p>The next challenge was presented by the instructions to “put the pot in a
        dung heap for fifteen days.” Because thermophilic bacteria colonize
        manure, keeping the pot in a manure pile would be an effective method
        for keeping it at a relatively warm, stable temperature for a long
        period of time. Procuring a sufficiently large pile of composting manure
        in New York during the winter proved impractical, necessitating an
        alternative means of incubating the soaking wood. I found that my
        crockpot maintains water at a temperature of roughly 66°C when set to
        “warm,” which is within the upper bounds of temperatures expected in
        composting manure, thus I kept the wood in its dye bath in this covered
        pot (<i><u>Fig. 6</u></i>).<a href="#fn14"

    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>I added 14 g of verdigris (copper acetate)

        wine vinegar.<a href="#fn15"

           role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> Prior to the experiment, I
        tested the solubility of the verdigris by adding 0.5 g to 20 ml of white
        wine vinegar in a beaker. While some of the verdigris dissolved and gave
        the vinegar a light green tint, after ten minutes of soaking and
        stirring, most of the copper acetate failed to enter into solution (<i><u>Fig. 7</u></i>). Briefly heating the beaker on a hot plate,
        however, almost immediately caused the rest of the verdigris to dissolve
        in the solution and changed the color of the liquid to a darker hue (<i><u>Fig. 8</u></i>). Stirring constantly, I brought the vinegar and
        verdigris solution to a temperature of around 60°C to ensure no crystals
        remained and slowly added 14 g of potash alum (<i><u>Fig. 9</u></i>).
        The alum was slower to dissolve than the verdigris, but after ten
        minutes of stirring with a glass rod, no hard crystals remained. The dye
        was heated to about 80°C for a period of ten minutes, then added to each
        of the two 6-oz mason jars containing the pre-soaked and dry wood
        samples. The jars were then set in the hot water bath (<i><u>Fig. 10</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 11</u></i>). After fifteen days, the jars were removed
        from the bath and the contents boiled in separate beakers for a period
        of three hours. The wet veneers were then dried for 48 hours and,
        finally, lightly sanded with 1000 grit sandpaper.</p>

    <p>On removing the wood from the dye bath, I realized I should have strained
        the ground madder root from the dye before adding the wood.<a

        caused by particles of madder root affixing to the wood during the final

        the veneers that were added to the dye without soaking and those that
        were soaked in water for 48 hours prior to dyeing.</p>
    <p>The basswood veneers, which had the lightest natural color of the three
        wood varieties, took on a brighter red color than the mahogany and
        cherry woods, which both turned a darker shade of red. Contrary to my
        expectations, there was no difference in the dye penetration between the
        two sample groups. In fact, upon cutting away a 1 mm strip from the edge
        of each veneer I was surprised to see how shallow the penetration of the
        dye was for each veneer. While I had certainly succeeded in producing
        red wood, there was no trace of pigment past the outermost layer of each
        sample, and the samples seemed no different than if I had brushed a
        stain over the surface.</p>

        formed around the rim of the lids, which made unsealing the jars very
        difficult, and after emptying the contents into beakers for boiling, I
        noticed more brown precipitate at the bottom of the containers. Instead
        of green, the veneers all became a rich shade of brown, again with no
        difference between the pre-soaked and non pre-soaked wood. In contrast
        to the madder-dyed veneers, however, the inner layers of these samples
        did appear slightly darker than the original wood color, possibly
        indicating that some of the pigment penetrated past the surface layer.

    <p>More experimentation would be necessary to determine the cause of failure
        in the green dye trial. In the sixteenth century, green was apparently
        difficult to obtain through dyeing and staining. As Flavia Perugini
        Philip and others have noted, verdigris oxidizes and changes from
        varying shades of green to dark brown when exposed to light or air,
        which may explain the presence of dark brown leaves and vines
        occasionally seen in examples of floral marquetry.<a href="#fn19"

        the fifteenth century, artisans may have avoided the problems of fading
        or oxidizing with verdigris-based dyes by using wood infested with the

    <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>An obstacle to advancing our knowledge of early modern wood coloring
        techniques is the inherent difficulty of analyzing the materials used in
        intarsia or marquetry works. Many of the dyed woods in extant marquetry
        objects have either completely faded or degraded to other colors. While
        performing conservation and restoration treatments on three pieces of
        furniture with extensive wood inlay from the late eighteenth century,
        Wilma Roelofs noted some of the fine coloring in the wood was only
        visible on the reverse sides of removed pieces of inlay, the only face
        “protected from the influence of light.”<a href="#fn22"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref22"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a> It is often impossible to
        discern which pieces of the inlay were originally dyed without removing
        large sections of the design and viewing the back side of the veneers.<a
           href="#fn23"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref23"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a> Colorfastness may be affected by
        a number of variables in the dyeing process, such as “quality and
        quantity of ingredients… quality of woods to be dyed… duration of the
        dyeing process… and any additional requirements such as heating up the
        dye of boiling woods in it.”<a href="#fn24"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref24"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
    <p>Beyond variables that might arise during the dyeing procedure itself, the
        treatment of inlaid surfaces over time has a great impact on color
        retention in dyed woods. While varnishing could protect certain pigments
        from fading or oxidizing due to air exposure, the application of certain
        varnishes could also accelerate loss of color. The shallow penetration
        of dye into the veneer also causes problems. Because exposure to air and
        ultraviolet light results in fading and degradation of colors, inlay
        artists and furniture conservators alike have often attempted to restore
        the original vibrant colors of wood by scraping away the outer layers to
        expose the color below.<a href="#fn25"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref25"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a> Repeated scraping can destroy
        the marquetry if the veneers become too thin, and this problem is
        magnified in the case of dyed materials. Yannick Chastang has noted that
        as few as three scrapings may be sufficient to almost completely erase
        delicate inlay work, but if dyes are unable to penetrate past the very
        surface of a veneer, it is likely the color could be lost after a single
        scraping treatment.<a href="#fn26"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref26"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
    <p>The reconstruction of historical dye recipes could help shed light on
        gaps in current scholarship and open up new ways of understanding
        artisanal practices and material culture. For example, while VIS
        spectroscopy is an accurate and non-destructive process for analyzing
        the chemical composition of dyes used in inlay work, this method
        requires reference samples to compare with material being tested.<a
           href="#fn27"

           id="fnref27"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a> We can never be completely
        certain of how any particular work looked at the time of making or of
        the original color palette. In their recent work on nineteenth-century
        synthetic wood dyes, Van Bommel and Fantini noted that simply
        identifying dyes through chemical analysis could not help them determine
        the original color of the work being studied, writing “methyl violet
        gives an intense purple colour while malachite green gives a strong
        green….[but] how purple, and how green?”<a href="#fn28"

        conservators and other scholars might be assisted by experimenting with
        the reconstruction of historical wood dyeing recipes. Reconstructing
        different dye recipes roughly contemporaneous with the work being
        conserved could provide reference samples and thus might help to
        identify ingredients used to color the wood and give some hints about
        the color palette.</p>

                <p>The urine used in this experiment was my own, collected over
                    a period of two days and aged in a sealed mason jar for six
                    days. While I was not able to record the pH of the urine at
                    time of collection, when tested right before preparing the
                    dye, the pH was neutral at 7. Previous experiments by other
                    students in the lab to change the pH of urine through aging
                    were similarly unsuccessful. We expected that because stale
                    urine was an alternative to vinegar, it should be acidic.
