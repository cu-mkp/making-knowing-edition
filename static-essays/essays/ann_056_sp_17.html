        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <div>
            <p>Glue is any substance that creates a bond between two separate
                objects or that prepares the surface for subsequent operations.
                In Ms. Fr. 640, fish glue in particular plays an important role
                in glueing delicate items. The author-practitioner, however,
                especially emphasizes two characteristics—clearness and strength
                of the glue—throughout the manuscript. Thus, I reconstructed
                three kinds of fish glue with different parts of the fish based
                on the recipe on fol. <a
                   href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/7r/f/7r/tl"><u>7r</u></a>
                in order to examine the reliability of the author-practitioner’s
                statements about making fish glue and, further, to demonstrate
                his comprehensive understanding of its use.</p>

    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
    <p>The author-practitioner makes frequent references to diverse kinds of
        glue and their applications in BnF Ms. Fr. 640. For example, there are
        entries on fish glue, as well as on such adhesives as mouth glue and
        starch glue,<a href="#fn1"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref1"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> and on such (as yet unidentified)
        glues as “colle de retailles,” “clear glue,” and “strong glue.”<a
           href="#fn2"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref2"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> Glue is also a key element in
        plaster and other materials used in making objects of interest to the
        author-practitioner.<a href="#fn3"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref3"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> His use of glue throughout the
        manuscript indicates that he understood this medium to be a very
        important tool, specifically, as an adhesive and as a surface
        conditioner in various recipes.<a href="#fn4"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref4"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> Interestingly, despite the common
        use of animal glues in artisanal work, the author-practitioner does not
        provide recipes for these kinds of adhesives. In fact, he only gives
        details for how to make fish glue, which is described on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/7r/f/7r/tl"><u>7r</u></a>
        in a recipe entitled “Fish glue or isinglass and mouth glue:”</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>It is made from codfish skin, boiled rather than being salted.
            Joiners glue their masterpieces with it and guitar makers use it for
            delicate works. It wants to be strongly beaten, then soaked gently
            in barely boiling water.</p>
        <p>Mouth glue is made of parchment scrapings and one uses it without
            fire, for glueing paper or similar things, wetting it with the
            mouth.<a href="#fn5"

        is analogous to another premodern fish glue recipe provided by Cennino
        Cennini (ca. 1370–ca. 1440), the Italian artist and author of <em>Il
            libro dell’arte</em>:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>There is a glue which is known as fish glue. This glue is made of
            various kinds of fish. If you put the little piece, or leaf, in your
            mouth, just as it is, until it gets a little wet, and rub it on
            sheep parchments or other parchments, this fastens them together
            very securely … It is good and excellent for mending lutes and other
            fine paper, wooden, or bone objects. When you put it on the fire,
            put in half a goblet of clear water for each leaf.<a href="#fn7"

    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>While both of these recipes for fish glue
        have few specifics, they give the modern reader a general understanding
        of the production and artisanal use of fish glue in the premodern era.
    </p>
    <p>Fish glue shares an important characteristic with other kinds of animal
        glue: it can be rendered back into a liquid form when heated, which does
        not affect its strength or durability upon cooling and solidifying.<a
           href="#fn8"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref8"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> This quality makes it suitable
        for repairing wooden furniture and musical instruments, and both fish
        and animal glues continue to be used in artisanal workshops today,
        especially in those of luthiers. As a woodworker, I have used many kinds
        of glues—including industrial glues and natural hide glue—in making
        table tennis blades, various kinds of pens (e.g., fountain pens, dip
        pens, and pencils), and conductors’ batons. However, I have never used
        fish glue in my work. Thus, a reconstruction of the fish glue recipe on
        fol. 7r provides me with the opportunity to try out a new adhesive; I am
        especially interested to do so, as contemporary artisans recommend it
        highly in their own musical instrument- and furniture-making
        practices.<a href="#fn9"

        how to use this glue in different projects, and the third entry presents
        a descriptive passage about its properties.</p>
    <h2 id="what-is-glue">What is Glue?</h2>
    <p>Glue is generally obtained from boiling animal hides and hooves, or fish
        parts, into a gelatin that hardens into a cement upon drying.<a
           href="#fn10"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref10"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> The essential quality of a good
        glue is twofold: to create a secure bond between the parts that are
        being joined, and to act as a protective layer between a given material
        and the environment. For a sense of how contemporaries of the
        author-practitioner understood glue, we can look to Randle Cotgrave’s
        1611 French-English Dictionary. Here, Cotgrave provides several entries
        under the term <em>colle</em> (glue), including two that are referenced
        in Ms. Fr. 640: <em>colle de bouche</em> (defined by Cotgrave as “mouth
        glue, water glue”), and <em>colle de poisson</em> (which Cotgrave also
        defines as “mouth glue, water glue”).<a href="#fn11"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref11"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
    <p>Fish glue is an organic adhesive made from boiling down the different
        parts of a fish, specifically the skin, air bladder, bones, or meat. It
        dries into a clear yellowish color, and it has been used worldwide in
        artisanal work from ancient Egypt to the present time as a binding
        medium for repairs in wood and in paper conservation.<a href="#fn12"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref12"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
    <p>The author-practitioner is clearly interested in fish glue, as we can see
        in his description on fol. 7r. Despite the brevity of this entry, the
        text contains a reasonable amount of detail regarding materials and
        process. For example, the author-practitioner prefers to use unsalted
        codfish skin; the skins need to be “beaten” and then simmered in “barely
        boiling water,” and he also indicates the length of time it takes to
        make the mixture in the accompanying marginal note: “One beats it and
        soaks it in white wine for one night, then one melts it on a slow fire.”
        Interestingly, this note also references the use of white wine and
        “spirits” in the production process, a term we will encounter again on
        fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/159r/f/159r/tl"><u>159r</u></a>,
        as discussed below.</p>
    <p>The author-practitioner views fish glue as an appropriate adhesive for
        joining the delicate parts of a cast metal rose and for using on the
        molded wings of a fly, on fols. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/155v/f/155v/tl"><u>155v</u></a>
        and <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/156v/f/156v/tl"><u>156v</u></a>
        respectively.<a href="#fn13"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref13"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> Here, he notes that the metal
        parts of the cast tin rose, “being thus thin,” are “is troublesome to
        solder, and may melt some of the leaves and also the cast flowers.”
        Accordingly, he suggests that “one does not take pains to solder, but
        one grafts the pieces to join them &amp; one glues them with fish glue
        that has been a little tempered &amp; thickly melted” (fol. 155v). This
        entry is interesting for the insight it provides into the
        author-practitioner’s material understanding of, and practical
        experience with, fish glue. The instructions about moistening glue given
        on fol. 155v recall details from fol. 7r about mouth glue, which “is
        made of parchment scrapings and one uses it without fire, for glueing
        paper or similar things, wetting it with the mouth.” Interestingly,
        Cennini also gives similar instructions for fish glue: “If you put the
        little piece, or leaf, in your mouth, just as it is, until it gets a
        little wet, and rub it on sheep parchments or other parchments, this
        fastens them together very securely.”<a href="#fn14"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref14"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> The detailed instructions for
        gluing the wings to the body of the cast fly on fol. 156v further
        illuminates uses of fish glue in joining together delicate objects:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>If some flaw happens to the wings of your fly, beat some tin very
            thin, or some gold or silver, if you have cast it in it, &amp; trim
            with some scissors what one needs to reattach there, &amp; next,
            apply it with your small pincers &amp; glue it with fish glue,
            prepared as put below. And before, heat lightly your work, in order
            that its coldness does not refuse the glue, which will be soon dry,
            heating it from afar. Next, cover lightly the joints of the
            reattached thing with some modeling wax, which is white wax mixed
            with a lot of ceruse or lead white, melting it well with a hot iron
            point. You will also cut some small bits of spinet strings &amp;
            glue with the said glue, &amp; once dry, that is to say the feet,
            repair with this. You will thicken them with the same melted wax, to
            render them equal.</p>
        <p>One could even cast it in gold &amp; silver, without the feet &amp;
            without applying it on a flower, by making the gate under the belly
            &amp; reattaching with solder the feet, &amp; if needs be the wings
            with the same metal, &amp; it could be enamelled by fortifying the
            wings a little &amp; the feet, as said.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>Fols. 155v and 156v are essentially about
        molding fragile things, and together they demonstrate how the
        author-practitioner understands the medium of fish glue as a material
        that imparts strength to vulnerable areas.</p>
    <p>A few pages later another entry about “Fish Glue” on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/159r/f/159r/tl"><u>159r</u></a>
        gives a detailed account of the reactions of this adhesive to various
        materials and conditions:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Beat it very fine &amp; thin on a well-cleaned anvil, &amp; next wet
            it with eau-de-vie over hot ashes &amp; a low fire, &amp; it will be
            quickly melted; &amp; if it is not strong &amp; thick enough, add
            eau-de-vie. And take heed not to put it to melt in a fatty vessel,
            but in a new one, if you can. It is melted on the fire &amp; is also
            dried quickly on the fire, but it may be warmed from a distance once
            on the work. It holds strongly. With it one joins flowers &amp;
            delicate things of gold, of silver, of tin, &amp; other materials
            which are in danger of spoiling if soldered.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>Here, the author-practitioner reveals
        interesting information about the properties of fish glue derived from
        the process of its production and the materials involved. This is
        apparent in his directions to use “spirits” (understood here as
        alcohol)<a href="#fn15"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref15"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> in making and tempering the fish
        glue, as it seems he believed this would impart a desirable consistency
        to the glue. Also, the author-practitioner’s reference to breaking down
        the fish glue into very small particles is very likely related to the
        process of its dilution into a clear mixture as it is being boiled down
        in water—as I will demonstrate in my own reconstruction of the fish glue
        recipe on fol. 7r.</p>
    <h2 id="reconstructing-fish-glue">Reconstructing Fish Glue</h2>
    <p>I designed three fish glue experiments, each of which uses a different
        part of the fish. My first experiment was modelled after the information
        provided by the author-practitioner on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/7r/f/7r/tl"><u>7r</u></a>
        and thus renders glue from codfish skin. However, my second and third
        experiments moved to another level of analysis, based on my examination
        of the author-practitioner’s references to “clear,” “very clear” and
        “quite clear” glue in the following group of entries: fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/75r/f/75r/tl"><u>75r</u></a>,
        “Bronze of copper” (“Take some verdet &amp; clear glue &amp; grind it
        together”), fol. 75v, “Gilding wood” (“put down a layer of very clear
        glue”), fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/78r/f/78r/tl"><u>78r</u></a>,
        “Another varnish” (“put down a coat of very clear glue”), fols. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/78v/f/78v/tl"><u>78v</u></a>–79r,
        “For making bronze” (“mix it with very clear glue” and “lay down on it
        one layer of very clear glue, &amp; let it dry”), and fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/79v/f/79v/tl"><u>79v</u></a>,
        “Making varnish” (“lay a coat of quite clear glue”). Despite the
        specificity of these terms (“clear glue,” “very clear glue,” “quite
        clear glue”), any material distinction between these glues remains
        ambiguous, as there is no information within Ms. Fr. 640 to indicate
        what, exactly, clear glue is (i.e., is it a quality, a material, or
        both?).</p>
    <p>The author-practitioner’s emphasis on clear glue and his diverse
        applications of it within the manuscript motivated me to also experiment
        with making fish glue from the air bladder of the fish as well as from
        the membrane encasing it to see if I could produce a glue with the kind
        of clarity that he seemed to be concerned with.</p>

    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>Taken together, these three experiments
        demonstrate that one can, in fact, easily attain various degrees of
        transparency in glue from different fish parts, in this case, with the
        skin, air bladder membrane, and the actual air bladder. However, as my
        research shows, each material produces its own distinct kind of
        transparency and color. Interestingly, each of the three fish glue types
        appears to have comparable strength, as I discuss below. The
        transparency and strength of a given glue were certainly important
        qualities to the author-practitioner, as evidenced in the folios cited
        above. My experiments respond to the ideas and engagement with fish glue
        that the author-practitioner possibly had. The following series of fish
        glue experiments, “Codfish Skin,” “Air Bladder Membrane,” and “Air
        Bladder,” thus deals with and explores a universal tool throughout the
        manuscript—glue.</p>
    <h2 id="experiment-1-codfish-skin">Experiment 1: Codfish Skin</h2>
    <p>My first experiment in making glue from codfish skin constitutes a useful
        starting point in assessing what the author-practitioner was looking for
        in “clear glue.” Could his various references to clear glue actually be
        a product of various kinds of fish glue? Of course the
        author-practitioner mentions mouth glue and starch glue, though not as
        much as he does fish glue. It remains to be seen through further
        research and experimentation whether mouth and starch glue could in fact
        share the qualities of fish glue that he seems to so highly prize.</p>
    <p>During the reconstruction I encountered some hurdles I did not anticipate
        in my textual analysis of this recipe.<a href="#fn16"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref16"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> For example, codfish has a black
        colored tissue that is part of the skin (<i><u>Fig. 6</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 7</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 8</u></i>), which proved very hard to
        remove, and the bits that remained did not in fact dissolve. Indeed,
        some of the skin itself also failed to fully dissolve (<i><u>Fig. 9</u></i>). Nonetheless, I cleaned all the meat residue from the skin, but
        when I cooked it, I noticed that the color of the water in which I was
        simmering the skins quickly turned yellowish—faster than I wished, since
        I had hoped that with this experiment I could produce a very clear glue.
        The end result was not very clear; rather, when the glue cured, it was
        almost opaque and a pale yellowish-brown (<i><u>Fig. 10</u></i>).</p>

    <p>Other unanticipated things occurred during my experiment with the codfish
        skins for which the author-practitioner had not prepared me. Although I
        cooked the skins for approximately eight hours, they still did not
        dissolve (<i><u>Fig. 11</u></i>). However, I could discern that the
        water was getting tackier and tackier as the mixture gradually reduced.
        By the time I decided to turn off the heat, only a little water
        remained, just enough to cover the bottom of the pot where the mixture
        was. I filtered the fish skin residue and poured the resulting
        mixture—the glue in its liquid form—into a baking tin and placed this
        into the oven at 300° F for about forty minutes in order to further
        reduce the water. After more than a quarter of the water had evaporated,
        I took out the baking tin, poured the remaining glue onto foil (<i><u>Fig. 12</u></i>), and let it harden (<i><u>Fig. 13</u></i>).</p>

    <h2 id="experiment-2-air-bladder-membrane">Experiment 2: Air Bladder
        Membrane </h2>
    <p>I was inspired to design this experiment based on a YouTube video
        produced by a fly fisherman entitled “Making Fish (Air Bladder) Glue,”
        which shows his process for making fish glue using an air bladder of a
        fish.<a href="#fn17"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref17"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> However, it was not at all
        apparent to me in watching this video if the person was also using its
        membrane; in fact, I believe either he did not separate the membrane
        from the air bladder or he was only using the air bladder (likely the
        former). I came to this conclusion only after I handled the fish air
        bladder myself and realized that it was encased in a rubbery, clear and
        flexible tissue-like substance (<i><u>Fig.14</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 15</u></i>). It was at this point that I decided to craft a
        separate experiment that used just this membrane, as I believed that
        because of its transparency, it might produce a clear glue.</p>

    <p>The results were perfect. The glue that I made from this membrane is

    <p>My third and final experiment used the air bladder itself, stripped of
        its membrane. The organ was a much tougher material to work with than
        its membrane. It resisted being cut up into small pieces, though I
        succeeded by using strong tailor’s scissors (<i><u>Fig. 17</u></i>).
        This material took around the same amount of time to render into glue as
        did the codfish skins—i.e., approximately eight hours—however, it did
        not dissolve as thoroughly as the membrane did, and its color was
        yellower (though lighter than that of the codfish skin) (<i><u>Fig. 18</u></i>). Its resulting transparency was somewhere between
        that of experiments 1 and 2 (<i><u>Fig. 19</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 20</u></i>).</p>

    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>I was inspired to create this simple jig
        to test the strength of my fish glues by the online article “Science
        Projects for Testing the Strength of Glue” by Jeremy Nicholson<a
           href="#fn19"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref19"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a> as well as by the
        author-practitioner’s directions on fol. 155v, where he advises joining
        the delicate parts of the rose with fish glue instead of solder. I
        recognized in the author-practitioner’s directions in this entry that
        when the leaves would be attached to the stems of the rose (“being so
        thin” and thus so “hard to solder”) they would constitute an angled
        joint. Thus, the angle of my jig mimics the possible angles of these
        delicate parts because a right angle is fragile and difficult to bond in
        woodworking.</p>
    <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The author-practitioner has definite ideas about the use, application,
        and qualities of glue as an adhesive and surface conditioner. He seems
        most concerned with clearness and strength. My reconstructions
        demonstrate how simple it is to make different kinds of fish glue that
        possess various degrees of transparency, and my jig tests show their
        strength. These material discoveries point to possible meanings behind
        the references to “clear glue,” “very clear glue,” and “quite clear
        glue” throughout the manuscript as well as those to strength, such as
        the one made on fol. 159r that fish glue “holds strongly.” My
        observations invite further investigation into the nature of the “clear
        glue” that is mentioned throughout the manuscript. For my part, I am
        impressed by the author-practitioner’s sophisticated understanding and
        handling of this important artisanal tool, and by the transmission of
        craft materials and practices from the Renaissance to the modern age.

                <p>For example, Christian Laborie, a viola da gamba maker
                    currently operating in France, states that “we use animal
                    glue because the bond is strong and reversible. I use fish
                    glue especially for gluing the top (soundboard) and hide
                    glue (used hot) for other operations like setting the
                    fingerboard (ebony wood) on the neck and gluing the neck to
                    the body.” This information was imparted to me by email
                    correspondence with Mr. Laborie on April 5, 2017. It appears
                    that Laborie’s use of fish glue in instrument making has to
                    do with reducing the tension that the tightened strings will
                    place on the joint between the soundboard and the side of
                    the instrument. Therefore, the tensile strength of this
                    adhesive is necessary to connect these parts. Bow making
                    constitutes another example of the benefits of using fish
                    glue to bond different parts together in order to ease
                    possible tension on the joints; see “Topic: Making Fish Glue
