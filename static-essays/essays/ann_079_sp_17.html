    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
    <p>Like many recipes in Ms. Fr. 640, the entry on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/66v/f/66v/tl"><u>66v</u></a>,
        “For preventing teats from swelling,” has several ambiguities, but this
        entry in particular reveals the challenges we face today in clarifying
        such uncertainty. Because it is a medical recipe, a reconstruction
        cannot test the efficacy of the substance due to safety concerns and
        ethical considerations; this means that much of the trial that has been
        so fruitful in other reconstructions is not an option. Moreover, this
        particular entry is also uncommon among the manuscript's medical
        recipes, which limits our ability to resolve ambiguity through a textual
        comparison. Nevertheless, my research shows that even under such
        constraints, reconstruction and close reading can provide valuable
        information about an early modern medical treatment.</p>
    <p>The first challenge we face is that the purpose of this remedy, expressed
        in the title, is not entirely clear. The swelling of breasts is one of
        the ailments that occurs nowhere else in in Ms. Fr. 640. Even though the
        title directly captures the “symptoms” of the ailment, I am unsure how
        to interpret it: is it related to specific gendered afflictions in early
        modern period? Next, the heading suggests that the author-practitioner
        expanded the initial scope of the recipe. The change in hand in the two
        lines of the heading indicates that the author-practitioner likely first
        recorded recipe as a remedy for preventing the swelling of breasts.
        Later, he added an additional line below the main heading, “or to
        diminish overly large ones,” a phrase that is even more ambiguous.</p>
    <p>The second area for investigation concerns ingredients. Most of the
        manuscript’s medical recipes have a relatively small number of
        ingredients, ranging from one to four. This remedy, on the other hand,
        uses eight different ingredients, including five herbs. In this regard,
        it can serve as a lens to examine the herbal remedies used in early
        modern medicine.</p>
    <p>Finally, this recipe is the only one in the manuscript that instructs how
        to make a “plaster.” However, the instructions concerning both
        fabrication and application are not clearly organized, and it is not
        clear whether such ingredients as the bread, for example, is part of the
        plaster or a vehicle of application.</p>
    <p>My research, relying on close reading, exploration of materials, and
        experimental reconstruction in the modern lab, seeks to clarify some of
        the recipe’s ambiguities by investigating the following questions: what
        was the remedy used for? What are the ingredients it refers to? And what
        was a plaster in the context of this recipe?</p>
    <h2 id="textual-evidence-early-modern-medicinal-materials">Textual Evidence:
        Early Modern Medicinal Materials</h2>
    <p>Although the names of most of the ingredients in the recipe are familiar,
        in the early modern period, they may have designated a different species
        or a special source or preparation. Historical understandings of the
        medical virtues of herbs can help us identify the plants required for
        this plaster and may provide further clues to the remedy’s use.</p>
    <p>The first ingredient we encounter is bread.<a href="#fn1"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref1"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> In her research essay on bread,
        Emma Le Pouésard reveals the complexity behind this seemingly
        straightforward substance by discussing three words in Ms. Fr. 640 used
        to refer to bread: <em>pain</em>, <em>rostie</em> and <em>ostie</em>.<a
           href="#fn2"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref2"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> The latter two, which have
        religious connotations, feature in medical recipes on fols. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/37v/f/37v/tl"><u>37v</u></a>
        and <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/79v/f/79v/tl"><u>79v</u></a>
        respectively The remedy on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/66v/f/66v/tl"><u>66v</u></a>,
        however, is the only medical recipe in the manuscript to use the neutral
        and secular term <em>pain</em> to denote bread. The difference lies not
        only in the term but also the application. <em>Pain</em> in this medical
        recipe is for external use, while <em>rostie</em> and <em>ostie</em> are
        for ingestion. This suggests the <em>pain</em> required for the recipe
        on fol. 66v was likely the most common bread available at that time.</p>
    <p>The next required ingredient is Venice turpentine or common turpentine,
        which was made from the resin of larch and pine trees, respectively.<a
           href="#fn3"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref3"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> Turpentine was typically used as
        an astringent and binding material in early modern medical
        preparations.<a href="#fn4"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref4"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
    <p>The remaining ingredients are all herbal: sumac, <em>prunelle</em>,
        quince seed, pomegranate flowers and olive leaves. Sumac is a common
        shrub in Eurasia and the Americas with multiple usages.<a href="#fn5"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref5"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> The local species in southern
        Europe is <em>Rhus coriaria</em>, which grows in stony places and can be
        found in the mountains and woods of Mediterranean regions. This is
        likely the species used by the author-practitioner in the recipe. Its
        medicinal virtues, of both leaves and berries, were acknowledged in the
        early modern period. But which part did the author-practitioner intend
        for this recipe? The 1597 <em>Herball Or Generall Historie of
            Plantes</em> records a remedy that uses sumac leaves in the making
        of an ointment or plaster to cure gangrenes<a href="#fn6"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref6"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> (necrotic ulcerations of the
        skin).<a href="#fn7"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref7"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> It thus seems likely that the
        sumac leaves were the ingredient used in the recipe on fol. 66v.</p>
    <p>The <em>prunelle</em>, or “selfe-heale,” is also known as brunell,
        hookeheale, sicklewort, and carpenter’s herb.<a href="#fn8"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref8"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> The herb grows in the fields of
        Europe. Among its various species, <em>prunella vulgaris</em> is the
        most common. It was used as an astringent by early modern physicians,
        who included it in decoctions for wounds or mouth-related ailments.<a
           href="#fn9"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref9"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
    <p>Quince and pomegranate were two plants commonly grown in the gardens,
        vineyards, and orchards of early modern Europe. Quince seeds can
        “alaieth the sharpness of biting humors” and are “good to be layed upon
        burnings or scaldings”).<a href="#fn10"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref10"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> Pomegranate flowers were also
        used as an astringent.<a href="#fn11"

           role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> Their medical properties were

           id="fnref12"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
    <p>Olive trees were also common in Italy, France and Spain. Their branches,
        leaves and tender buds were described as “cool, dry, and binde.” Olive
        oil was also used to cure swelling, joint pain, inflammation and burning
        ulcers.<a href="#fn13"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref13"

    <p>This brief survey of the herbs applied in this recipe shows they were all
        common plants either growing in fields or cultivated in gardens. The
        general availability of these herbs suggests the remedy was a practical
        therapeutic that could be easily prepared at home. All of the herbs were
        considered either cool or dry, or they were used as astringents. They
        were commonly used in cures for skin afflictions, such as burns, wounds,
        ulcers, inflammation and swelling. Thus, they appear appropriate for use
        in a remedy for “preventing teats from swelling” and “diminishing overly
        large ones,” if we read this affliction as a general swelling of the
        skin.</p>
    <h2 id="sourcing-of-materials-and-reconstruction">Sourcing of Materials and
        Reconstruction</h2>
    <p>Sourcing the materials was the greatest challenge in reconstructing the
        recipe on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/66v/f/66v/tl"><u>66v</u></a>.
        After identifying each ingredient, we started to look for modern
        equivalents or substitutes. I decided to use whole wheat bread to
        approximate <em>pain du commun</em>, and I prepared two kinds of
        turpentines for comparison: larch turpentine and silver fir balsam.</p>
    <p>Sourcing the herbs proved most difficult. Olive leaves and
        <em>prunelle</em> (currently known as “heal-all”) are still used today
        as herbal teas; I bought them from a New York herbal shop “Flower &amp;
        Power.” Quince fruit, which contains seeds, is sold at the market. The
        other three herbs, however, are not currently available from local
        herbal or food suppliers. I started the sourcing in late April, when the
        weather in New York City was still cold. Thus the pomegranate flowers
        were shipped from California. My search for sumac leaves (specifically
        of <em>Rhus coriaria</em>) in different botanical gardens failed; I
        settled on a substitute, the <em>Rhus glabra</em>, found in New York’s
        Morningside Park. Even though it is not the right species, <em>Rhus
            glabra</em> is also used as an astringent and a material for dye,
        suggesting it has similar properties to the <em>Rhus coriaria</em>.</p>
    <p>As the recipe does not specify the amount of each ingredient, I decided
        to use 50 ml of each turpentine.<a href="#fn14"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref14"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> I also used the quince seeds
        from one fruit, which amounted to about 3 grams, as a baseline
        reference, and used the same amount of all the herbs. I mixed and ground
        the herbs in a mortar and then divided them into two batches, one for
        each kind of turpentine (<i><u>Fig. 1</u></i>).</p>

        <li>

        <li>
            <blockquote>
                <p>heating the mixture, constantly stirring with a wooden
                    chopstick, and keeping the temperature around the flash
                    point of the turpentines (larch: 59°C; silver fir balsam:
                    78°C).</p>
            </blockquote>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>The recipe does not provide information about the duration of cooking. I
        thus drew on a nineteenth-century recipe for making a plaster with
        turpentine, which indicates the turpentine should be “boiled to a
        plaster-like consistency” (<i><u>Fig. 2</u></i>).<a href="#fn15"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref15"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> This “plaster-like consistency”
        revealed itself in the process. The larch turpentine was initially very
        viscous and hard to pour and stir, while the silver fir turpentine was
        less viscous and easier to mix with the ground herbs. Nonetheless, after
        heating to their respective flash points, both turpentines became more
        fluid, making them easier to stir and mix with other materials. I cooked
        both plasters for ten minutes and then spread the respective mixtures on
        two pieces of bread. Since the turpentines become viscous again after
        cooling, it is better to apply them to the bread while they are still
        hot (<i><u>Fig. 3</u></i>).</p>

    <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Compared to other medicinal materials explored in the Making and Knowing
        project, such as wax, oil and acid, the herbs underwent relatively
        little transformation during the reconstruction. In this case, the
        herbal preparations were incorporated with the other materials rather
        than transformed into a new state, with the turpentine functioning as a
        binding agent. The reconstruction helps us approximate the visual
        appearance of a medicinal plaster, but the textual research on the
        properties of the various ingredients ultimately shed the most light on
        this ambiguous recipe on fol 66v.</p>

                    also gives “sloe,” which refers to the fruit of the

                    this term in the Project’s Edition as “sloe” was based on
                    the fact that the entire phrase on fol. 66v is “prunelles de
                    buissons,” which, according to Guy Miège, <em>A New
                        Dictionary French and English</em> (London, 1679), s.v.
                    “prunelle,” and the <em>Nouveau dictionaire du voyageur,

                    The ingredients gathered for the reconstruction discussed in
                    this essay were thus based on a faulty reading of the
                    manuscript, and the experiment could be repeated with
                    <em>prunus spinosa</em>.<a href="#fnref8"
