        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <div>
            <p>This critical edition of the late sixteenth-century anonymous
                manuscript cataloged as Ms. Fr. 640 in the Bibliothèque
                nationale de France was created through the work of team
                members, students, and collaborators of the Making and Knowing
                Project at Columbia University. The technical and artistic
                “recipes” contained in Ms. Fr. 640 provide an outstanding
                opportunity to explore the epistemic and historical
                intersections between craft making and scientific knowing,
                especially in light of the emergence of a new science in the
                following centuries. Ms. Fr. 640 provides important insights
                into the material, technical, and intellectual worlds of late
                sixteenth-century Europe, and brings a better understanding of
                how and why nature was investigated, used in art, and collected
                and appreciated in early modern Europe. It sheds light, as well,
                on the type of knowledge possessed by handworkers, known today
                as “practical knowledge,” “how-to,” or “makers’ knowledge.” At
                the heart of the Edition of Ms. Fr. 640, however, lies an
                intriguing puzzle: who was the anonymous individual who wrote
                down (and in many cases tried out) these 930 entries filling 170
                folios, and why did a French nobleman collect and preserve this
                manuscript?</p>

        realms are regarded as separate, the empirical techniques of experiment
        and observation employed in the natural sciences have important origins
        both in the creative labors of Renaissance artists and artisans’
        workshops and in the empirical methods pioneered by Renaissance
        humanists and historians. Over the course of the seventeenth century, in
        the period known as the Scientific Revolution, collaboration and
        experimentation that had taken place within the craft workshop became
        integrated into the practice of the natural sciences. In the eighteenth
        century, however, as the new sciences became increasingly
        institutionalized, these shared origins became obscured, and since then,
        the divisions between the natural sciences and the arts and humanities
        have become ever wider: scientists work in labs, historians in archives,
        and artists in studios. Studying the pre-modern workshop provides an
        opportunity to bridge the modern communities of artists, historians, and
        scientists.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>Drawing on techniques from both laboratory and archival research as well
        as studio practice, the Making and Knowing Project aims to cross the
        science/humanities divide and explore the relationships between today’s
        laboratories and the workshops of the past, and between early modern
        conceptions of natural knowledge and our own understanding of science,
        art, and historical scholarship. Since 2014, this exploration has been
        carried out by means of the Project’s sharp focus on a well-delimited
        object of research: the creation of a digital critical edition of an
        intriguing anonymous sixteenth-century artisanal and technical
        manuscript, Ms. Fr. 640 (see Smith, “Making the Edition”).<a href="#fn4"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref4"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> This manuscript provides
        important insights into the material, technical, and intellectual world
        of the late sixteenth century, and brings a better understanding of how
        and why nature was investigated, used in art, and collected and
        appreciated in early modern Europe. The evidence about pre-modern
        materials and techniques in this manuscript also sheds light on the
        significance of materials and modes of work to the makers of art, a
        crucial part of understanding the meaning of art in its own time. The
        knowledge possessed by handworkers, known today as “practical
        knowledge,” “how-to,” or “makers’ knowledge,” has recently emerged as an
        important area of study for historians both of art and of science,<a

           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref5"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> and the Edition of Ms. Fr. 640
        can shed light not only on what kind of knowledge the manuscript’s
        anonymous author possessed about techniques and materials, but also,
        more broadly, how the work of <em>making</em> was related to
        <em>knowing</em>. Indeed, the overarching theme of the Project and its
        work on the Edition has been to show the ways in which <em>making is an
            epistemic activity</em>, or, in other words, a form of knowing,
        rather than simply an applied form of a higher type of knowledge. Craft
        and skilled making deserve to be taken seriously as a form of knowledge
        in their own right.<a href="#fn6"

    <p>The creation of this Edition has been generously supported by many
        institutions and foundations, and the almost six years of work on the
        Edition created a network of over 400 students and collaborators in the
        humanities, arts, and social and natural sciences at institutions
        worldwide who have worked together with the Project to undertake
        interdisciplinary research, teaching, and knowledge exchange. See all

        The Project’s collaborative approach, combining document-, object- and
        laboratory-based research with digital humanities tools has aimed to
        challenge the separation of pedagogy from original research, the
        division between the sciences and scholarship in the humanities, and
        methodological considerations of historical evidence. It has also
        furthered theorizing and thinking about the nature of craft knowledge.

        <strong>The Manuscript—Ms. Fr. 640</strong>
    </h2>
    <p>Sometime after 1579, an anonymous individual began recording techniques
        for many different processes we would now classify as belonging to the
        fine arts, crafts, and various techniques and technologies.<a
           href="#fn7"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref7"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> Over the course of an unknown
        span of time (probably until 1588,<a href="#fn8"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref8"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> but certainly no later than the
        1620s), this person filled 170 folios (or 340 single pages) with closely
        written text and some hand-drawn figures containing recipes,
        instructions, fragmentary notes, firsthand accounts of trials with many
        materials and techniques, and observations on myriad subjects, including
        drawing instruction, pigment application, dyeing, coloring of metal,
        wax, and wood, imitation gem production, making molds and metal casts,
        arms and armor, plant and tree cultivation, preservation of animals,
        plants, and foodstuffs, distillation of turpentine, and much else. The
        resulting manuscript, now housed in the Bibliothèque nationale de France
        (BnF) as Ms. Fr. 640, has been preserved since the early seventeenth
        century in the binding of Philippe de Béthune, count of Selles and
        Charost, apparently the manuscript’s first owner. Entitled on its spine,
        <em>Choses diverses</em> (diverse things), it entered the King’s Library
        (the core of the later Bibliothèque nationale) as part of the donation
        in 1662 of the family’s library by Philippe’s son, Hippolyte de
        Béthune.<a href="#fn9"

           role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> (<i><u>Fig. 1</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 2</u></i>) Ms. Fr. 640 is a unique record giving insight into
        many subjects, but is focused especially on processes and practices of
        making things from natural materials. Thus, it is an especially valuable
        source for the history of craft and material culture, and for the
        history of art and science in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth
        centuries. Many things about this manuscript are, however,
        extraordinarily intriguing and puzzling.</p>

    <h2 id="the-puzzle-of-ms.-fr.-640">
        <strong>The Puzzle of Ms. Fr. 640</strong>
    </h2>
    <p>The over 900 titles that are set off in larger Italic handwriting from
        the text of the manuscript give the impression that Ms. Fr. 640 is a
        kind of recipe book organized by process and grouped under these neat
        headings (See the List of Entries: <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/entries"><u>https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/entries</u></a>).
        A closer reading of the 170 folios shows this to be a misleading
        impression. In some entries, the text beneath the headings clearly
        matches the subject of the title, but in others it describes instead a
        related process, or a continuation of a previously begun process, or a
        seemingly associated thought of the writer. Moreover, the text below
        each heading by no means forms a set of straightforward recipe-like
        instructions, and it frequently omits important components of the
        processes described, whether from the writer’s ignorance about the
        procedures, or from an assumption that these were common knowledge.
        Although the script of the headings is neatly written and regularly laid
        out on the pages, the content often appears to be disorganized,
        contradictory, and repetitive. Additions and corrections in most of the
        margins and empty spaces around the central blocks of text add to the
        complexity of the text. Every entry requires decipherment, not just
        because it deals with materials and processes that are lost to history,
        but also because the text is not linear and often contains only parts of
        a process. The rest of the process may sometimes be found elsewhere in
        the manuscript (instructions and observations on molding turtles are
        scattered throughout the text in eight different places), but full
        descriptions of processes are also frequently relegated to a shorthand
        statement to carry it out “as you know,” as if the writer expected this
        knowledge to already be familiar to a potential reader. In other words,
        this is far from a tidy recipe book.</p>
    <p>The contents of the manuscript are, as the title on the spine warns,
        extraordinarily diverse. Indeed, they are far too diverse to constitute
        the expertise or artisanship of a single craftsperson. Who was the
        writer of this manuscript? Was the writer a man or a woman? Female
        authorship of Ms. Fr. 640 is not impossible, however, it appears highly
        unlikely in light of the manuscript’s orthography—women and men
        generally used different scripts at this time—as well as the writer’s
        accounts of travel and of other workshops. Thus, this Edition refers to
        the writer of the manuscript as male throughout. Though this individual
        remains anonymous, we have some insight into his interests and
        expertise. By far the area of his greatest interest was the making of
        molds and the casting of metals, and his over 350 entries for such
        processes are scattered throughout the manuscript, though they are
        especially densely clustered from fols. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/79v/f/79v/tl"><u>79v</u></a>–93r
        and <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/106r/f/106r/tl"><u>106r</u></a>–170v.
        What might loosely be called “painting” entries (dealing with pigments
        and paints, applying paints, observations on painting techniques, making
        brushes, and so on) are particularly concentrated on fols. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/56v/f/56v/tl"><u>56v</u></a>–66r.
        Varnish making recurs throughout the manuscript, but a grouping can be
        found on fols. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/3r/f/3r/tl"><u>3r</u></a>–4v.
        The extremely detailed and valuable entries on arms and armor are
        clustered on fols. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/21r/f/21r/tl"><u>21r</u></a>–28r,
        with a remarkable account of the techniques of the <em>fourbisseur</em>,
        or sword furbisher, who assembled swords and rapiers, on fols. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/94r/f/94r/tl"><u>94r</u></a>–97r.<a
           href="#fn10"

        to 79r. There is no apparent overarching order to the entries, with
        recipes for casting, medical remedies, pigment-making, fruit tree
        grafting, dyeing, and other topics interspersed in what appears to be a
        random order. Brief medical instructions are scattered throughout the
        text, and the entire manuscript begins and ends with medical recipes,
        including a prophylactic against the plague and a general health
        preservative.<a href="#fn11"

        supplementary observations, or descriptions of firsthand experience, or
        even with sketches to clarify his words. The many entries on making
        molds for the casting animals and plants from life and the techniques
        for casting into these molds are especially dense with such notes and
        annotations.</p>
    <p>The manuscript’s diverse entries have been grouped by the Making and
        Knowing Project into 26 broad categories loosely corresponding to
        processes and materials that the Project felt represented core
        preoccupations of the writer. These categories are not, it must be
        emphasized, those of the writer of the manuscript, but rather are an
        index created by the Project in order to make navigation of the
        manuscript simpler. <i><u>Fig. 3</u></i> shows a graphic
        representation of the groupings of entries into categories, and gives an

                broad categories loosely corresponding to processes and
                materials that the Project felt represented core preoccupations
                of the author-practitioner. This chart shows the entries grouped
                by percentages of the whole manuscript to give an overview of

        <strong>The Material Text and its Composition</strong>
    </h2>
    <p>The material manuscript—its quires, folios, and binding—bears traces of
        its composition, use, and history, and offers clues about the individual
        who compiled and penned its contents. It appears likely that fol. 170v
        was originally at the beginning of a bound, mostly-blank codex, perhaps
        recording accounts such as those mentioning payments for land of the
        Ouvrier family, a prominent family of Toulouse, that include the dates
        of 1578 and 1579 and that now form the struck-through and upside-down
        text at the bottom of fol. 170v (<i><u>Fig.5</u></i>). It would
        seem that the writer, possibly in the employ of the Ouvrier family,
        struck through this record of accounts, drew a horizontal line, and
        began to record medical recipes and a list of titles under this account
        block. Then, when he ran out of room, he flipped the entire book over,
        and turned it upside down, to continue the list of titles on the page
        that that now forms fol. 1r of the present manuscript.<a href="#fn13"

           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/2r/f/2r/tl"><u>2r</u></a>
        continues with a list of “books to recover” and a medical remedy, and <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/2v/f/2v/tl"><u>2v</u></a>
        lists a single book title, then, in a hand that is much more cursive,
        but likely the same writer as the main hand (Hand A), recipes for making
        imitation emeralds and sapphires. Fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/3r/f/3r/tl"><u>3r</u></a>
        follows in the main hand (Hand A) with a cross at the top of the page (<i><u>Fig. 6</u></i>), perhaps indicating, by this common method
        of marking the first page of a text, that it is in fact the intended
        start of a new text.<a href="#fn14"

        sources of knowledge are mentioned), as well as copious firsthand
        experience. In contrast to the first and last pages, which contain a
        large percentage of medical recipes, the main body of the manuscript
        contains only a few scattered medical recipes. The only folios to depart
        from the practical tenor of the rest of the book are fols. <a

    <p>Although most folios are full to overflowing with marginal notes, the
        manuscript itself is without stains or burns, which makes it clear that
        the writer was working on it away from the space of hands-on workshop
        practice. The fact that headings are written out in Italic cursive, with
        text centered below them (not always correlating very precisely to the
        headings) seems to presuppose a pre-existing set of notes and “recipes”
        that was being organized into a single continuous text in the space of
        this new codex. The writer found it hard to organize his knowledge under
        discrete headings, however, as what seems to have begun as a fairly
        regular spacing of headings in many cases, became instead a sometimes
        palimpsest-like confusion of text (see, for example, fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/3r/f/3r/tl"><u>3r</u></a>
        on <em>Coral contrefaict</em>, fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/66r/f/66r/tl"><u>66r</u></a>–v
        on <em>or mat,</em> and fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/125r/f/125r/tl"><u>125r</u></a>
        on casting). He may have added the many notes and insertions—often
        recording his hands-on trials—nearly simultaneously with the first
        recording of the entry texts, or in subsequent, multiple campaigns of
        returning to the manuscript to make additions and corrections. At some
        points, the manuscript seems no more than a collection of notes. At
        others, it is akin to a commonplace book, a literary technology commonly
        used by scholars to collect materials for use in their writing,
        lectures, and conversations. It might equally be seen as a so-called
        <em>zibaldone</em> or <em>libro di ricordanze</em>, kept by merchants
        and artisans to record prices, observations, and recipes of use to their
        businesses. The manuscript as a whole, however, is not just a collection
        of notes, nor only a commonplace or record-keeping tool (although it is
        <em>also</em> that), but, instead, the clean manuscript and the
        carefully written headings over a centered text block are evidence of
        some overarching plan to organize the material under headings for future
        use.</p>
    <p>At some point after the manuscript came into the Béthune collection,
        probably in the first decades of the seventeenth century, the likely
        soft binding of the manuscript was cut off, the quires were cut apart
        and paper strips glued around the edges of each page. This was a common
        method of protecting the edges of a manuscript when being rebound. In
        the process, some lines of text that had run into the margins were
        obscured, but they remain mostly legible and have been included in the
        transcriptions and translation of the Edition.<a href="#fn15"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref15"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> The 170 folios of the manuscript
        were then rebound to match the rest of the Béthune library in a red
        morocco leather marked with the coat of arms of Philippe de Béthune.
        Such a process of rebinding could lead to the rearrangement of
        manuscript pages, but this does not seem to have been the case for Ms.
        Fr. 640. This process may, however, shed light on the aforementioned
        discrepancies between the end pages and the rest of the manuscript. The
        key here may be the two numbering systems of the manuscript folios, both
        beginning with the numeral 1: one sequence of numbers begins on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/1r/f/1r/tl"><u>1r</u></a>
        (and runs for 170 folios), and the second begins on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/3r/f/3r/tl"><u>3r</u></a>
        (and runs for 168 folios). The numbering that begins on <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/3r/f/3r/tl"><u>3r</u></a>
        is sometimes obscured by the paper strip indicating that it was the
        earlier sequence of pages, and certainly in existence before the
        re-binding campaign. The numbering that begins on <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/1r/f/1r/tl"><u>1r</u></a>
        was carried out when the manuscript was rebound, or afterwards. This
        seems to indicate that fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/3r/f/3r/tl"><u>3r</u></a>,
        where the recording of recipes begins in earnest, was an original start
        to the manuscript. The rather miscellaneous folios—1r–2v and 170v—with
        their medical recipes and lists of books were perhaps not intended to be
        included as integral parts of the text. It is important to emphasize,
        however, that the writer of the recipes on <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/3r/f/3r/tl"><u>3r</u></a>
        and of the lists of authors and books on what are now the end pages was
        the same person.</p>
    <p>Who was this person? Was he a practitioner of one of the arts described
        in the manuscript, trained by apprenticeship, and recording his
        expertise for himself or posterity? Or, was he a scholar and author of
        other types of books, as was the German preacher and polymath Wolfgang
        Sedelius (1491/2–1562), or a collector of recipes like the Huguenot
        physician, Théodore Turquet de Mayerne (1573–1655), both treated in
        other essays in this Edition?<a href="#fn16"

        hedged its bets about the identity of the man responsible for Ms. Fr.

    <h2 id="the-writer">
        <strong>The</strong>
        <strong>Writer</strong>
    </h2>
    <p>The large majority of the manuscript is written by a single individual in
        a clear and competent hand (Hand A). He uses two different scripts
        (French and Italic cursive), sometimes written at higher speeds in
        greater haste (for example, fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/2v/f/2v/tl"><u>2v</u></a>,
        <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/157v/f/157v/tl"><u>157v</u></a>,
        and the marginal note on <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/161r/f/161r/tl"><u>161r</u></a>
        seem to have been scrawled at speed). In addition, there are four other
        hands. Two separate sections in the manuscript show that a scribe or
        collaborator was taking dictation with the main writer making
        corrections to the terms unfamiliar to the scribe (Hand D, some entries
        on fols. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/57r/f/57r/tl"><u>57r</u></a>-58r
        and <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/77r/f/77r/tl"><u>77r</u></a>–79v).<a

           id="fnref17"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
    <p>The writer employs specific technical terms or unusual words in short
        spans of folios, as if he had collected these entries from the same
        informant or text. For example, the Occitan words <em>viron</em> and
        <em>biron</em>, denoting a gimlet, a small boring tool that the writer
        elsewhere names as a <em>guimbelet</em>, appear only in the entry on
        petards on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/168r/f/168r/tl"><u>168r</u></a>–v.
        Similarly, the materials <em>colle bien claire</em> (clear glue) and
        <em>alung de glace</em> (glass alum) are clustered only on fols. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/75r/f/75r/tl"><u>75r</u></a>–78r.
        Some entries appear as a group, likely copied from a textual source or
        collected from an informant, such as those on sleight of hand tricks
        that begin on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/33r/f/33r/tl"><u>33r</u></a>
        and end on 36r,<a href="#fn18"

        entries on oil of sulfur may have been copied from another source is
        that they do not include marginal notes, corrections, or first-person
        comments on process, in contrast to, for example, many of the molding
        and casting recipes. While the processes recorded by the writer are
        found in other how-to texts and certainly were authentic, in the sense
        of being used to produce actual objects still extant from this period,
        the Project—despite much searching—has up to now found no identifiable
        texts from which the writer copied verbatim.</p>

    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>While the two master painters based in
        Paris, Nicolas Cousté and Jean Cousin (ca. 1522–94), are well-known and
        documented, the currier, or leather dresser, Jean Garnier, is only known
        through a document that testifies to his death in 1588, which may
        indicate that the manuscript was completed before that year.<a

           role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a> Jean Cousin, today known as Jean
        Cousin the Younger, was a lettered artisan, documented as attending the
        University of Paris in 1542. He was the son of Jean Cousin the Elder
        (1490–1560), a prosperous artisan from Burgundy, who began his career as
        a surveyor but went on to become a painter, engraver, sculptor, and the
        author of a popular treatise on perspective, <em>Livre de
            Perspective</em> (1560). The son took over his father’s workshop in
        Saint-Germain in Paris, and followed his father in publishing his own
        <em>Livre de Portraicture</em> (contracted 1589, published 1595). Jean
        Cousin the Younger sketched portraits of François de Béthune (father of
        Philippe) and François’s sister. The statement that Jean Cousin “knows
        of the master” is particularly intriguing, as it perhaps indicates the
        master who wrote down the many practical processes of Ms. Fr. 640.</p>
    <p>The mention of these three Paris-based artisans suggests that the
        manuscript originated in Paris and perhaps in close proximity to the
        Béthune family. Such clues are at odds, however, with the many
        references in the rest of the manuscript to towns and villages of the
        Languedoc, to landholding families and other prominent individuals
        residing in Toulouse and its environs, and to the use of Occitan to
        denote some tools and natural materials. Such features all point to the
        manuscript being composed in Toulouse.<a href="#fn23"

        origin for the manuscript in Paris and one in Toulouse is just one of a
        number of discrepancies between the few beginning and ending folios
        (1r–2v, 170v) and the substantial body of the manuscript (3r–170r). The
        fact that the first and last pages, with their lists of authors and
        published books, and the overwhelming majority of the body of the
        manuscript, with its stolidly practical recounting of processes and
        first hand trying and testing, were all written by the same person has
        made a clear understanding of the genesis of the manuscript and the
        identity of its writer an intriguing quest.</p>
    <p>Who was the “author-practitioner” who wrote this text? A scholar—an
        expert in <em>knowing</em>—who recorded the list of artisans and all the
        <em>auctores</em> and books in French and Latin on the first and last
        partial quires of the manuscript, or an artisan—expert in
        <em>making</em>—who recorded the 900 plus practical “recipes” and
        workshop observations of the other 167 folios?</p>

        <strong>The Identity of the Author-Practitioner I: The Artisanal
            Practitioner</strong>
    </h2>
    <p>Was the author-practitioner an artisan, and a member of an artisanal
        guild? In the 167 folios of practical “recipes,” he refers to many guild
        professions in a manner that suggests they are not his own: for example,
        although he makes acute observations about painting and includes many
        detailed instructions on creating lifelike <em>carnation</em> or flesh
        colors, he refers to <em>paintres</em> (painters) and <em>artistes</em>
        (artists) as professions seemingly separate from himself. He does the
        same for glaziers, pewterers, potters, cloth fullers, blacksmiths,
        locksmiths, sword furbishers, crayfish catchers, “those who make
        gemstone foils,” and many others. In total he mentions well over 100
        professions.</p>
    <p>His greatest interest is in moldmaking and casting, the subject of over
        350 entries, many of which are quite long and detailed, and appear to
        have been returned to repeatedly in order to add further information.<a
           href="#fn24"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref24"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a> Entries on substances to make
        metals run fluidly through a mold give evidence that he both collected
        information and carried out firsthand trials, and these passages, too,
        show much repeated engagement.<a href="#fn25"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref25"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a> These entries on making molds
        and casting metals seem to indicate that the author-practitioner
        possessed expert knowledge of founding metals. Nevertheless, he refers
        to goldsmiths and founders in many entries as “they,” rather than “we,”
        although this may indicate a stylistic effort. He also describes various
        precious stones—both authentic and artificial—and their treatments, with
        what appears to be the expert knowledge of a goldsmith,<a href="#fn26"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref26"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a> however his text includes none
        of the raising work that would have been part and parcel of a
        goldsmith’s workshop. It seems probable that he was not a master
        goldsmith (at least not one who wanted to represent his trade in
        writing), but he might have been making medals and other small works,
        perhaps supplying goldsmiths.<a href="#fn27"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref27"

           role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a> Indeed, even masters might
        specialize: Benvenuto Cellini (1500–71) records his meeting in 1525 with
        a certain Perugian Master Lautizio in Rome, who did nothing but make
        seals modeled in wax and cast in bronze, for the bulls of cardinals.<a

           role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a> The author-practitioner might
        have been such a craftsman (perhaps without having reached the position
        of master), making small objects, mostly cast, for he clearly possesses
        firsthand knowledge of casting in a range of metals. He has gathered or
        witnessed working practices from other parts of Europe, and he makes
        frequent mention of German metalworking methods. His reference to “my
        goldsmith’s forge” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/12v/f/12v/tl"><u>12v</u></a>)
        may be the strongest clue to his identity. Sarah Muñoz highlights the
        differences between an early seventeenth-century manuscript fragment,
        apparently associated with Toulouse’s mint, and Ms. Fr. 640, concluding
        that a guild context for Ms. Fr. 640 is very unlikely. Another essay in
        this Edition by Colin Debuiche gives a portrait of the Toulouse master
        goldsmith and entrepreneur Raymond Masse, who provides an intriguing
        comparison.<a href="#fn30"

           role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
    <p>Comparison can also be made with goldsmiths at the Paris court, who
        exhibited very broad interests in a number of different trades: Marin le
        Bourgeoys (ca. 1550–1634), for example, wrote down many observations and
        recipes for a range of processes similar to that of Ms. Fr. 640.<a

        1614. His books were all in the vernacular, with the inventory including
        descriptions of the illustrated works (probably as these were of a
        higher value). This group included, among others, books of architecture
        by Serlio and Alberti, works that detailed ancient iconography, such as
        <em>Discours de la religion des Romans</em>, Vannuccio Biringuccio’s
        <em>Pirotechnia</em> in French, Guillaume Rondelet’s <em>Histoire

        author-practitioner evinces an eye for detail in such a wide variety of
        artisanal techniques that it is thinkable that he could have occupied
        such a position. Moreover, and especially unusually, Ms. Fr. 640
        contains recipes that would have been employed for short-lived art works
        of court festivals and public spectacles, and, this too, might indicate
        that the author-practitioner practiced his artistry within a courtly
        milieu, although he could just have well as made ephemeral art for a
        city, as did Jean Cousin the Younger and Nicholas Cousté.<a href="#fn34"

    <p>The interest of the author-practitioner of Ms. Fr. 640 in metal alloys
        for casting objects ranging from cannons and guns to cast-from-life
        turtles and snakes was acute, and his familiarity with the Royal Arsenal
        in Toulouse and the name of the Arsenal’s master founders in the late
        sixteenth century—the Poncet—suggests a background as a founder of
        metals. His apparent lack of knowledge about the actual casting process
        for cannons—which took place hidden from prying eyes behind the walls of
        the Arsenal—indicates that he was almost certainly not involved in
        cannon founding.<a href="#fn35"

           role="doc-noteref"><sup>35</sup></a> Sculptors and founders were in
        close contact, however. The state foundries in the Venetian Arsenal, for
        instance, were sometimes used by sculptors.<a href="#fn36"

           id="fnref36"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>36</sup></a> Founders often became sculptors.
        For example, Claude Pelhot, who cast the remarkable sculpture of
        <em>Dame Tholose</em> in 1544, was a master founder in the Toulouse
        Arsenal. Pierre Poncet was apprenticed in 1537–40 to Pelhot. The
        author-practitioner mentions a large sculptural portrait of Jesus that
        he made when experimenting with different molding “sands” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/85v/f/85v/tl"><u>85v</u></a>),
        and numerous entries in Ms. Fr. 640 have to do with such experiments in
        making sand molds, especially for portrait medals (<i><u>Vid. 2</u></i>). Whether the author-practitioner was a sculptor with a background in a
        foundry must remain an open question, but he shares many interests with
        the well-documented arsenal founder of Toulouse, Barthélémy Fraysse.<a

        showcase the artistry of the human hand. (<i><u>Fig. 7</u></i>) The
        manuscript’s recipes for objects that demonstrated the imitation of
        nature’s artifice by the human hand, such as those for imitation gems (<i><u>Fig. 8</u></i>) and imitation coral (<i><u>Fig. 9</u></i>), would
        have delighted such a collector, because they gave an exact and
        authentic portrayal—known as a “counterfeit”—of natural materials.
        Indeed, the first entry in the main text of Ms. Fr. 640 on fol. <a

        also contains entries for the coloring of wax, wood, and horn that aimed
        to imitate other materials. The author-practitioner also exhibits a deep
        interest in capturing lifelikeness by human artifice, such as in recipes
        for preserved flowers (<i><u>Fig. 10</u></i>) and lifecast animals and
        plants (<i><u>Fig. 11</u></i>). Especially appealing to a
        <em>Kunstkammer</em> collector would have been those objects in which
        art and nature’s artifice was entwined, for they stimulated
        conversations about the relationship between nature and art. Just this
        sort of object was the aim of Ms. Fr. 640’s entry for “animals dried in
        an oven,” that created lifelike animals embellished by art with horns
        and wings (<i><u>Fig. 12</u></i>).<a href="#fn42"

    <p>Philippe’s interests may also be reflected in the unusually detailed
        attention to arms and armor in the manuscript (fols. <a

           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/94r/f/94r/tl"><u>94r</u></a>–97r).
        In his writings, Philippe noted that a noble needed to understand
        weapons, but not necessarily know how to make them.<a href="#fn44"

           id="fnref44"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>44</sup></a> A close interest in weaponry
        could also have been displayed by a member of the Toulouse bourgeoisie,
        required to serve in the civic militia, who perhaps sought glory and a
        career through battle, for which the Languedoc in the years of intense
        religious strife from the 1560s through to 1621 offered ample
        opportunity. Conflict was especially severe in and around Toulouse in
        the thirty years from 1562 to 1592, precisely during the years of the
        manuscript’s probable composition (ca. 1579–1588).<a href="#fn45"

    <p>Bourgeois householders, scholars, and nobles were all interested in
        practical knowledge for a variety of reasons. The learned and leisured
        son of a London beer brewer, Hugh Plat (1552–1608), collected practical
        knowledge in <em>The Jewell House of Art and Nature</em> (1594) to
        further the economic health of Britain and to protect his countrymen
        from dearth and famine.<a href="#fn46"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref46"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>46</sup></a> The son of a cloth merchant and
        dyer, Georgius Agricola (1494–1555) attended grammar school, then
        university in Saxony, then traveled to Bologna in pursuit of the new
        learning of the <em>studia humanitatis</em> that trained young men in
        the authors of the late Roman Republic for a life of civic action.
        Subsequently appointed as city physician in the mining boom town of St.
        Joachimsthal, Agricola sought to employ his learning in the new world of
        a silver-mining boom town, publishing much in Latin on practical
        knowledge. As an eventually very wealthy shareholder in the mines, he
        sought to reconcile his own world of the boom town with the texts and
        ideals of the ancient Roman world. As was common for scholars interested
        in restoring the learned and civic ideals of Roman antiquity, his first
        book, <em>Bermannus</em> (1530), consisted in a philological exercise to
        bring the words of the Ancients and his own time’s experiences together.
        In the numerous word lists contained in this book, he recovered and
        invented Latin terms that translated for a scholarly audience the mining
        jargon he learned from the miners with whom he conversed and whom he
        treated as a physician.</p>
    <p>Agricola’s method of collecting experiences derived from the empirical
        dimensions of his work as a city physician and his humanist’s interest
        in Roman historical authors. Medicine increasingly depended on case
        studies and on a new genre of <em>observationes</em>, both of which had
        to be collected by trained observers.<a href="#fn47"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref47"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>47</sup></a> History formed a key discipline
        for ancient authors because it developed judgment and prudence (aspects
        of the wisdom required for reasoned action by individuals and rulers).
        Because historical writing consisted entirely of examples of human
        experiences, it provided exempla for optimal courses of action in the
        face of the contingencies of <em>fortuna</em>.<a href="#fn48"

        <em>De re metallica</em> (1556) was modelled on the <em>De re
            rustica</em> of the Roman agricultural author Columella. In this,
        Agricola sought to equate the estate holding of the landed elite with
        the activities of the mine shareholder, and he aimed to demonstrate that
        mining was as honorable as the free Roman citizen’s cultivation of the
        land.<a href="#fn49"

    <p>In a similar effort, the son of a well-to-do Parisian printing family,
        Charles Estienne (1504–1564), also trained in the <em>studia
            humanitatis</em>, published an anatomical treatise <em>De
            dissectione</em> in 1548, and in 1553, a humanist encyclopedia that
        gathered terms and names from the texts of antiquity for the use of his
        fellow scholars and authors, <em>Dictionarium historicvm ac poeticum:
            omnia gentium, hominum, locorum, fluminum, ac montium antiqua
            recentioráq; ad sacras ac prophanas historias, poetarúmque fabulas
            intelligendas necessaria vocabula, bono ordine complectens</em>. In
        1554, he authored an agricultural compendium, <em>Praedium
            Rusticum</em>, that collected aphorisms and advice from Roman
        agricultural writers, including Columella. Ten years later in 1564,
        Estienne’s son-in-law, Jean Liébault, translated the volume into French
        as <em>La Maison Rustique</em>, revising and reorganizing it to be used
        as a practical guide by landowners on their estates. He claimed the book
        would further the interests and utility of his native France, but he
        also hoped to tap the financial possibilities of a booming book market
        to bolster his own precarious financial situation. <em>La Maison
            Rustique</em> experienced great success, going on to many
        reprintings, and inspiring a raft of French agricultural manuals
        following in its wake.<a href="#fn50"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref50"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>50</sup></a> The Latin humanist publications
        of the upwardly mobile scholar Estienne and the French reprintings of
        his son-in-law Liébault reflect a significant generational shift that
        occurred a century after the invention of printing, as the book market
        and its new audiences made writing and publishing in the vernacular a
        source of income and livelihood. In this market, practical knowledge was
        in high demand; the author-practitioner of Ms. Fr. 640 might also have
        been responding to this market.</p>
    <p>The <em>studia humanitatis</em> avidly pursued by Agricola and Estienne
        aimed to provide the undergirding for a life of practical action in the
        service of a polity, an ethic that the learned diplomat, poet, and
        Secretary to the Princes of Orange, Constantijn Huygens (1596–1687),
        pursued throughout his long life. As it had for Agricola and Estienne,
        this way of life also fostered for Huygens an interest in and
        familiarity with the practical and mechanical arts, for these arts were
        crucial to the functioning of civic life and they were a bountiful
        source of commodities by which the burgeoning commercial cities of
        Europe lived. Like other scholars of the Republic of Letters in his
        time, Huygens left much evidence in his correspondence of his lively
        personal interest in the practical arts. As Rozemarijn Landsman and
        Jonah Rowen show in their essay “Molding hollow on one side and in
        relief on the other,” Huygens collected information on molding and
        casting medals, and had a manuscript written by the goldsmith Adriaen
        Rottermont sent to him in 1629. Philippe de Béthune, too, was a diplomat
        and statesman, busy in affairs of state, and, as Vera Keller notes in
        her essay, his <em>Le Conseiller d’Estat</em> published in 1633 observes
        that craftspeople and their manufactures—in addition to trade and
        agriculture—formed the basis for the riches of a polity. He regarded it
        as essential to seek out skilled craftspeople and multiply their
        number.<a href="#fn51"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref51"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>51</sup></a> Perhaps Ms. Fr. 640 is the
        result of such a search.</p>
    <p>Nobles like Philippe de Béthune were intrigued by the mechanical arts for
        their manufactures, but also because these secured their military might,
        especially processes like the gun and cannon production included in Ms.
        Fr. 640. The arts and objects of Ms. Fr. 640’s recipes also helped to
        adorn their palaces and fill the collections which represented and
        broadcast their cultural power—as essential a tool of governance as
        weaponry. Nobles competed to attract artisans to their courts and
        residences, and some even learned mechanical arts themselves. The
        Wittelsbach dukes of Bavaria are a prominent example. Duke Albrecht V
        (1528–1579) founded the Munich <em>Kunstkammer</em>, and his heir,
        Wilhelm (1548–1626), and second son, Ferdinand (1550–1608), were taught
        lifecasting when they were young, with some of Ferdinand’s pieces still
        extant in the court’s <em>Kunstkammer</em>.<a href="#fn52"

        carpenter. Others, such as August, Elector of Saxony (1526–86),
        collected artisans’ tools, including many metalworking tools he
        commissioned himself, such as a deluxe, fully functional wire-drawing
        bench and related instruments.<a href="#fn53"

    <p>The pursuit of practical knowledge involved some nobles in alchemy.
        Famously, Francesco I de’ Medici, had himself depicted by Jan van der
        Straet (called Stradanus) at work in an alchemical laboratory. In
        contrast to its gold-seeking reputation today, alchemy in the sixteenth
        century was regarded by many as the highest and most noble pursuit of
        disinterested wisdom, which, as an added bonus, resulted in many
        practically useful byproducts. Ms. Fr. 640 contains a single recipe on
        fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/52r/f/52r/tl"><u>52r</u></a>–v
        which could be called alchemical, entitled “The work done in Algiers”
        (<em>Oeuvre faicte en Argel</em>), for a powder made from putrefied
        silkworms that aimed to transform antimony into a substance resembling
        gold but of a lesser weight. The use of silkworms for such a process is
        unknown in any other alchemical source.<a href="#fn54"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref54"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>54</sup></a> The manuscript also includes a
        list of ingredients, “Provisions for the work of Colchis”
        (<em>Provisions pour l’œuvre de Colchos</em>, fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/102r/f/102r/tl"><u>102r</u></a>),
        that might reflect preparations for an alchemical process. Both entries
        are notable among alchemical literature for their remarkably practical
        descriptions, containing no hint of the esoteric or spiritual sides of
        alchemy. A mention in passing is made on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/16r/f/16r/tl"><u>16r</u></a>,
        of a method used by “alchemists” to melt forged and brittle iron by
        adding “realgar or lead or orpiment.” This illustrates that the term
        “alchemist” was often used in the sixteenth century to denote any
        artisan, but especially a metalworker, who engaged in transforming the
        states and properties of metals and other materials. It did not
        necessarily connote gold-seeking, which was known as “chrysopoetic
        alchemy.” The use of the term “alchemy” served instead to indicate the
        pursuit and investigation of transformation in general, a realm of
        activity that could encompass both mundane material practices and
        esoteric spirituality.<a href="#fn55"

    <p>Many more examples of scholars and nobles who interested themselves in
        practical activities or who even practiced artisanal techniques are to
        be found in cities, on landed estates, and in noble courts throughout
        the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, and beyond, but one more
        scholar bears comparison with the author-practitioner of Ms. Fr. 640:
        Samuel Quiccheberg (1529–67) who composed a treatise on how to construct
        a collection suitable for a prince, <em>Inscriptiones, vel Tituli
            theatri</em> <em>amplissimi</em> (1563–65). Originally trained as a
        physician, Quiccheberg served in the 1560s as librarian for Duke
        Albrecht V of Bavaria. His text included a room-by-room inventory of the
        types of objects and materials such a <em>Kunstkammer</em> collection
        should contain. He appended to it a lengthy list of nobles, patricians,
        merchants, scholars, citizens, and artisans who collected objects
        produced by the mechanical arts. Quiccheberg’s text contains not only
        references to many of the types of objects for which Ms. Fr. 640
        contains instructions, but also advises that such a collection include
        workshops (including alchemical furnaces),<a href="#fn56"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref56"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>56</sup></a> thereby making clear the
        link—also present in Ms. Fr. 640—between collectible
        <em>Kunstkammer</em> objects and the circumstances and techniques of
        their making. The treatise also trumpets the connection that Quiccheberg
        and others, including Philippe de Béthune, saw between the pragmatic
        wisdom of governing (<em>prudentia</em>) needed by a statesman or prince
        and the practical techniques and knowledge of artisanal making. Could
        the author-practitioner of Ms. Fr. 640 have been a scholar like
        Quiccheberg? Two folios of the manuscript not only help provide a
        perspective on this question, but also shed light on some of the
        possible larger aims of the author-practitioner of Ms. Fr. 640.</p>

        workshop).<a href="#fn57"

           id="fnref57"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>57</sup></a> In these entries, the
        author-practitioner has gathered together pronouncements of
        <em>auctores</em> and aphorisms that could be materials for a preface to
        the reader, thus suggesting that a coherent and potentially published
        book was the goal of his recipe writing and testing. A somewhat
        different phrasing of one of the aphorisms on fol. 166r—“the harvester
        is not reproached for leaving some ears of wheat”—also occurs on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/1r/f/1r/tl"><u>1r</u></a>
        as “the harvester that leaves some ears is not blamed,” creating the
        single link between the seemingly extraneous first and last folios and
        the rest of the manuscript.</p>
    <p>At first glance, fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/162r/f/162r/tl"><u>162r</u></a>
        contains seemingly random material taken from the first five pages of
        Herodotus’s <em>Clio</em>. However, when these excerpts are read in
        conjunction with the entry starting fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/166r/f/166r/tl"><u>166r</u></a>,
        they cohere and point toward a program for a more general aim of the
        author-practitioner. On fol. 162r, he writes two entries containing
        information on Ancient navigation and trade, making the point that the
        Portuguese were not the “inventors” of navigation “as they brag,” and
        two entries on outstanding examples of handwork from the Ancient
        world—including heavy gold bowls and a joined and soldered iron vase. At
        the end of his citations from the ancient author, the
        author-practitioner adds, “As small peddlers lay open small wares in
        order to buy richer ones &amp; to profit more and more, so I, from a
        desire to learn, am exposing what little is in my workshop to <del>have
            it</del> receive, through a common commerce of letters, much rarer
        secrets from my benevolent readers.” This statement points strongly to a
        plan to disseminate the processes from his “workshop” through
        publication. Here, the author-practitioner seems unmistakably to have
        readers in mind. On fol. 166r–v, he elaborates on and justifies this
        aim. First, he makes clear his altruistic intentions: “As the hen
        carefully searches the garbage thrown out of a house for a crumb or a
        grain that she divides among her chicks, thus one distributes to orphans
        that which has been sought among the arts considered vile &amp; abject.”
        Then, he contrasts the otiose nature of the “Tablet of Cebes,” known in
        the sixteenth century as a curriculum to develop virtuous and learned
        scholars, to “the workshop” that “represents all things active.” Does he
        here mean his paper workshop, Ms. Fr. 640, which he intends to turn into
        a book entitled <em>La Boutique</em>?</p>
    <p>The next block of text continues with a blast of scholarly quotation not
        present in the rest of the manuscript, although very much consistent
        with his jibe at the Portuguese on fol. 162r. It is so distinctive that
        it is worth quoting at length:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>If the jealous disapprove that these things are picked up &amp; taken
            from others, reply that since <em>Nullum est jam dictum quod non

            all arts were invented in the space of a thousand years, so that you
            do not think that you are able to invent anything new but rather
            rediscover anew the books of Numa, buried <del>par</del> &amp; long
            unknown &amp; forgotten, in order to publish them for those who do
            not know them; so that as the preceding day is teacher for the
            subsequent, thus you needed to learn from those who preceded you in
            order to teach to those who come after. The Latins took from the
            Greeks, as Cicero from Plato &amp; Virgil from Homer. Aulus Gellius,
            Valerius Maximus only made a collection from various authors who had
            already written. Livy made his xxiii book from the 2nd or 3rd of
            Polybius. Serapis was deemed the inventor of agriculture among the

            stuff, even though he did not dye &amp; twist, wind &amp; prepare

    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>Such a passage betrays the scholarly
        practice of collecting <em>topoi</em> (references to places in the texts
        of other authors) about craft practices and about the process by which
        knowledge is made and transmitted. In its remarks about weavers and
        masons, it also displays an unusual consciousness of the processes of
        specialization that go into the making of things, and the last quotation
        from a psalm of David shows a profound appreciation of the work of the
        hand. The entire passage forms a spirited defense of the process of
        making knowledge through long transmission and accumulation, emphasizing
        that “you needed to learn from those who preceded you in order to teach
        to those who come after.”</p>
    <p>In these two folios, then, we seem to have a scholar-author who can be
        compared to Quiccheberg, and who had the ultimate aim of publishing a
        collection of recipes, entitled “La Boutique” (The Workshop). Unlike
        Quiccheberg’s <em>Inscriptiones</em>, however, the author-practitioner’s
        book could not have been composed in Latin because he apparently had a
        somewhat shaky grasp of Latin and his reading of Herodotus only
        progressed as far as page five.<a href="#fn59"

        <strong>How-to Texts</strong>
    </h2>
    <p>If the ultimate aim of Ms. Fr. 640 was a publication-ready how-to text,
        then, given the repetitive, apparently disorganized, and often
        contradictory content, it seems fair to say that the author-practitioner
        had not progressed very far toward his goal. Whether this was indeed his
        aim, or the text was instead a kind of how-to commonplace book for the
        author-practitioner’s use alone, the manuscript can be compared to other
        kinds of technical writing (another name for how-to literature).</p>
    <p>Ms. Fr. 640 is just one of a number of technical texts that appear from
        about 1400, when many types of craftspeople began to write down their
        techniques.<a href="#fn61"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref61"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>61</sup></a> Before this, books of practice
        (which existed from ancient times) were almost exclusively written by
        individuals from the scholarly world who only sometimes were informed by
        contact with actual makers. In contrast, around 1400, artisans
        themselves took up the pen, including metalworkers, painters, gunpowder
        makers, ships’ pilots, fortification builders, masons, mariners, and
        dancing masters, among many others. Some artisan-authors are well-known,
        such as the goldsmith and celebrated sculptor of the Florentine
        Baptistery doors, Lorenzo Ghiberti (1378?–1455), whose manuscript “I
        Commentarii” assimilated portions of antique authorities—in particular,
        Pliny and Vitruvius—as well as medieval optical theory transmitted from
        Arabic into Latin, to provide a history of the arts and a theory of
        artistic practice.<a href="#fn62"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref62"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>62</sup></a> Painter-turned-polymath Leonardo
        da Vinci (1452–1519), who trained in the workshop of Andrea di Cione,
        known as Verrocchio (1435–1488), sought to engage on an equal footing
        with the literati in philosophical debates of his day. In contrast to
        his master Verrocchio, however, who philosophized only in his works of
        art,<a href="#fn63"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref63"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>63</sup></a> Leonardo put his ideas down in
        words on paper in vast quantities. While none of Leonardo’s writings
        appeared in print during his lifetime, the nineteen-year younger
        Albrecht Dürer (1471–1528), working in Nuremberg at the heart of the
        printing industry in the German lands, set up a printing press to
        publish his own prints and books on architecture, perspective, and human
        proportions. Benvenuto Cellini’s (1500–1571) <em>Trattati
            dell’Oreficeria e della scultura</em> (1568), and his autobiography
        (unpublished until the nineteenth century) helped make the name of this
        exceptional goldsmith. Somewhat less renowned, perhaps, is Bernard
        Palissy (1510–1589), French surveyor and glass-painter, best known as a
        potter, who published two extraordinary texts, <em>Recepte véritable par
            laquelle tous les hommes de la France pourront apprendre à
            multiplier et augmenter leurs thrésors</em> (“True Recipe by which
        all the men of France can multiply and increase their treasure”) in
        1563, and <em>Discours admirables</em> <em>de la nature des eaux et
            fontaines, tant naturelles qu’artificielles, des métaux, des sels et
            salines, des pierres, des terres, du feu et des émaux</em>
        (“Admirable Discourses on the nature of waters and fountains, natural
        and artificial, of metals, of salts, of stones, earths, fire, and
        enamels/glazes”) in 1580.<a href="#fn64"

           id="fnref64"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>64</sup></a> In both books, Palissy made
        clear his thoroughly physical labor in engaging with nature and
        producing objects, but this labor, he claimed, gave him authority to
        philosophize about natural processes. Unlike other artisan-authors in
        this period, Palissy lays bare, in his antagonistic dialogues between
        personified <em>Theorique</em> (Theory) and <em>Practique</em>
        (Practice), the social and intellectual tensions that existed between
        practitioners and scholars, and between those who represented their
        knowledge as higher-order theory and those who were increasingly
        regarded as mere rote laborers.<a href="#fn65"

        famous of artisans who turned to writing in the course of the fifteenth
        and sixteenth centuries.</p>
    <p>This rather sudden onset of artisanal self-consciousness and
        self-assertion took place in the context both of greater literacy among
        urban artisans (especially those, like goldsmiths, at the top of the
        guild hierarchy), and of increasingly powerful territorial rulers who
        needed artisans for war technologies, for the building and outfitting of
        ships for trade, and for the display of political and cultural power in
        the rulers’ new seats of governance in urban courts.<a href="#fn66"

        of gunpowder weaponry came into use in Europe, practitioners responded
        to the rapidly changing war technologies by writing texts to advertise
        their expertise. These include an anonymous work on gunpowder, the
        <em>Feuerwerkbuch,</em> first written down in the first decades of the
        fifteenth century, but not printed until 1529,<a href="#fn67"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref67"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>67</sup></a> and gunners’ treatises, such as
        those cited by Pascal Brioist in his essay in this Edition.</p>
    <p>Self-conscious artisans-turned-authors, such as the Sienese Mariano di
        Jacopo, called Il Taccola, wrote about siege engines and guns in <em>De
            Ingeneis</em> (1433) and <em>De Machinis</em> (1449), and Francesco
        di Giorgio Martini (1439–1501), a painter trained in Siena who wrote two
        treatises between the 1470s and 90s on architecture, engineering, and
        military machines. Such author-practitioners began to call themselves
        “engineers” and “architects,” neither of which was a recognized trade at
        the time, but they claimed that, given their literary abilities, they
        had an overview—even a “theoretical” perspective—that the common artisan
        did not, and thus they merited this new title. Many of these new
        author-engineers aimed to “reduce into art” the many different
        activities and realms of expertise that made up the realm of an
        engineer’s purview. Hélène Vérin argues that these writings represent a
        reform of <em>method</em>, based on the assumption that writing down
        technical processes and “reducing” the arts into a single method, as
        many humanists, architects, and engineers attempted, would produce new
        abilities, including quicker intuition and oversight of practical
        techniques. Their authors also promised that such texts would give new
        insight into methods of acquiring and, particularly, of putting into
        efficacious use the knowledge gained. This kind of knowledge was crucial
        in realms such as navigation and war, where contingency reigned. In
        these conditions, the ability to identify, seize and exploit the moment
        was of existential importance.<a href="#fn68"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref68"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>68</sup></a> Such texts put forward methods
        to produce and transmit knowledge that authors claimed would give
        greater control of the forces at play in the human and natural worlds.
    </p>
    <p>All these author-practitioners, trained first in hands-on practice in an
        apprenticeship, practiced what were called “the mechanical arts,”
        working with their hands to produce objects and make a livelihood. Their
        writing signaled a departure from the traditional modes of producing and
        conceptualizing textual knowledge, in which individuals trained in
        schools and universities in the liberal arts (the arts of a <em>homo
            liber</em>—the financially independent and well-born “free”
        citizen), gathered knowledge from the texts of the ancients, seeking to
        interpret, dispute, or to draw out of it general principles. This was
        the work of a trained and reasonable mind, work regarded by most as
        nearly impossible for a person engaged in disfiguring manual work who
        labored under the necessity of the sordid business of making a living.
        Accordingly, the texts of manual workers sometimes contained little else
        than recipes, a form of codified knowledge derived from experience that
        had nothing to do with the learned culture of university scholars.</p>
    <p>The trickle of how-to manuscripts penned by practitioners became a flood
        after the invention of the printing press in the 1450s, with technical
        and experiential texts appearing in large numbers by the 1480s and 90s.
        When craft practitioners became authors, they brought into being a new
        genre of “books of the art,” <em>libro dell’arte</em> in Italian, or
        <em>Kunstbüchlein</em> in German, and began to articulate a form of
        knowledge that had not previously had systematic written form. Ambitious
        artists, such as those mentioned above, came to see such texts as
        necessary to demonstrate their individual talents and creativity to
        patrons who might employ them, but in actuality all such texts emerged
        out of the collective production of material and natural knowledge,
        sometimes stretching back for millennia.</p>

        arguments about natural philosophical knowledge and the reform of
        intellectual hierarchy made by Bernard Palissy. Palissy’s explicit,
        self-conscious claims that he is birthing a new method of

           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref79"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>79</sup></a> and its apparent state as a
        working manuscript. In the molding and casting sections, the author
        records his trials and even reminds himself at times to “Try this”
        (e.g., on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/131r/f/131r/tl"><u>131r</u></a>).
        The margins surrounding the body texts overflow with the
        author-practitioner’s comments on his trials of various technical
        processes. In view of the proliferation of how-to books and technical
        writing in Europe during the early modern period, the singular nature of
        Ms. Fr. 640 renders it all the more interesting as a primary source,
        for, whether written by a scholar or an artisan, it forms much more than
        a prescription of procedure, or a collection of recipes; it is also a
        rich record of workshop processes and attitudes toward the material
        world.</p>
    <h2 id="new-modes-of-knowing">
        <strong>New Modes of Knowing</strong>
    </h2>
    <p>Perhaps the most important evidence that Ms. Fr. 640 offers to the
        historian of craft and science is that the search for a single
        identity—for an artisan <em>or</em> a scholarly author—is misleading
        because it presents a false dichotomy. In the sixteenth century (and far
        beyond), the background of apprenticeship and handwork in a trade could
        mark the social identity and status of a person for their entire life,
        yet there was at the same time much interaction between such individuals
        with a background in the mechanical arts and those trained in letters at
        university. Literacy in general had grown across Europe from the
        fifteenth century, impelled by the advent of merchants’ schools,
        religious reform, the redesign of books brought about by humanist
        educational reforms, and the market-driven concerns of the printing
        trade, to name only some of the relevant factors. Indeed, by the late
        sixteenth century, the majority of urban artisans—especially those of
        the elite trades—would have been literate, and at least some of them,
        such as Jean Cousin the Younger, mentioned above, attended grammar
        school and even some years of university. Any artisan ambitious to rise
        further needed to master languages, letters, and literature. Authorship
        was the mark of a man of letters, and it could make clear that the
        status of a practitioner of the liberal arts—rather than the
        mechanical—had been achieved.<a href="#fn80"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref80"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>80</sup></a></p>
    <p>Ms. Fr. 640 thus gives evidence of a crucial social change that resulted
        from the increased interaction between sites of knowing (universities)
        and sites of making (artisanal workshops), but it is also a testament to
        the remarkable growth of interest in practical knowledge among people of
        all levels of society over the course of the period from about 1450
        through the eighteenth century. This burgeoning interest, driven in
        crucial ways by the representation of power at the noble courts of
        Europe, helped create and foster a market for works of practice and
        technical writing.</p>
    <p>One of the most important outcomes of the writing down of practice was to
        spur members of the newly founded scientific societies, such as the
        Royal Society of London for Improving Natural Knowledge (fd. 1660) and
        the French <em>Académie royale des sciences</em> (fd. 1666), to seek out
        such technical collections and the artisans who produced them.<a
           href="#fn81"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref81"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>81</sup></a> In the eighteenth century, such
        technical information came to be systematized and rationalized, and ever
        more closely connected to the pursuit of useful natural knowledge,
        culminating in such widely disseminated texts as William Lewis’s
        <em>Philosophical Commerce of Arts Designed as an Attempt to Advance
            Useful Knowledge</em> (London, 1748), as well as Ephraim Chambers’
        <em>Cyclopedia or an universal dictionary of the arts &amp;
            Sciences</em> (2 vols, 1728), Johann Zedler’s <em>Universal
            Lexikon</em> in the 1730s, Abbé Pluche’s <em>Le spectacle de la
            nature</em> (1732–51), the <em>Descriptions des arts et métiers</em>
        (1761–88), and finally the <em>Encyclopédie, ou Dictionnaire raisonné
            des Sciences, des Arts et des Métiers</em> (1751–72) of Denis
        Diderot and Jean le Rond d’Alembert. It is fair to say that none of
        these eighteenth-century collections aimed solely to convey technical
        information, and most of them were not authored by artisans. Instead,
        eighteenth-century practical collections sought to reform existing
        paradigms of knowledge as well as to reinforce structures and
        hierarchies of knowledge-production.</p>
    <p>The power and potential of practical knowledge continued to be praised
        and pursued throughout the early modern period, and it contributed
        crucially to the growth of a new form of knowledge we now call the
        natural sciences, characterized by the union of sensory and hands-on
        empirical techniques of making, such as experiment, with aims to make
        not just things, but to produce written and generalizable knowledge
        about the behavior of nature and its causes.<a href="#fn82"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref82"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>82</sup></a> As these methods and aims were
        institutionalized by the scientific societies of the seventeenth
        century, the <em>philosophes</em> of the Enlightenment, the new research
        laboratories of nineteenth-century universities, and the
        military-university-industrial complex of the mid-twentieth century, the
        goal remained for modern natural scientists, as it had been for the
        author-practitioner, to manipulate the materials of the natural world to
        produce not only useful objects, but also a type of natural knowledge
        could be replicated and built upon indefinitely.</p>
    <h2 id="making-as-knowing">
        <strong>Making as Knowing</strong>
    </h2>
    <p>Ms. Fr. 640 thus shows with clarity that the production of things in an
        artisan’s workshop is not devoid of epistemic activity, for it is a
        process of making knowledge about nature. For an artisan, making always
        involves cognitive processes of knowing, as both the testing and trying
        of non-standard materials to make use of them and comparisons between
        alternative ingredients to gauge their efficacy result in higher order
        and generalizable forms of knowledge. In the period when the anonymous
        author-practitioner wrote down the procedures in Ms. Fr. 640, artisans
        were the experts in the behavior of natural materials and processes—we
        could even say they were the scientists of their day.<a href="#fn83"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref83"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>83</sup></a></p>
    <p>Especially in the practice of imitating materials, such as the many
        “counterfeit” materials made by the author-practitioner (<i><u>Fig. 13</u></i>), and even in the everyday practice of any artist
        confecting pigments from raw materials, an artisan explores the behavior
        of natural materials by manipulating them to transform their properties,
        and even their nature, in the process of pushing them to mimic other
        materials.<a href="#fn84"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref84"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>84</sup></a> In exploring the properties of
        materials, artisans must carefully observe their characteristics and
        behavior. From this, they form categories of material behavior and
        taxonomies of materials themselves, and they use these to hypothesize
        about what materials and processes might work equally well in a given
        situation. Sometimes this process results from the testing of
        non-standard materials, as potters make test pieces to try out new
        glazes; sometimes it results from the lack of familiar materials in a
        new environment, or the necessity of finding a cheaper substitute. Often
        it is through the making of imitation or artificial—even
        counterfeit—materials that this process of trying, assaying,
        experimenting, and innovating occurs. This process of knowledge-making
        informs the artisan’s “material imaginary,” or system of knowledge that
        plays a role in guiding further experimentation with materials and their
        transformation. Although such a knowledge system may not be explicitly
        proclaimed in the text of Ms. Fr. 640, some of the research essays in
        this Edition seek to identify such knowledge systems in the processes
        recorded in the manuscript.<a href="#fn85"

        how such workshop practices as are illuminated in its text can be one
        (perhaps, <em>the</em>) central source for the empiricism of the
        so-called scientific method that was developed over the centuries after
        Ms. Fr. 640 was set down into writing. This method involves close
        observation, experimentation, and hypothesizing, all the everyday
        epistemologies of artisans in their workshops.<a href="#fn86"

    <p>For the historian of science, then, how-to texts give essential insight
        into the making of modern science, and for other specialized fields of
        history, such as art history and material culture, they form a vital
        source for historical techniques, information on the material conditions
        of production, and issues of daily life and livelihood.<a href="#fn87"

        broader significance, for they can illuminate important characteristics

        their full import by writing. They necessitate an additional mode of
        investigation—reconstruction or re-making—which has been used by some

                <p>The binding, stamped and gilded with the arms and device of
                    Philippe de Béthune (1565–1649) indicates that the
                    manuscript was part of the bequest of the Béthunes to the
                    royal library in 1662 (registered by Parlement in 1664).
                    Orthography and various dates within the manuscript reveal
                    that it was composed after 1579 and probably before 1588.
                    The strips of paper glued around the sides of the original
                    leaves of the book and the fact that the watermarks on the
                    endpapers differ from the text block, indicate that the
                    pages were rebound (as does the double set of page numbers).
                    The watermark on the text block is that of the papermaker
                    Nicolas Lebé of Troyes, active ca. 1561–96. For more
                    information, see the essays in this Edition by Marc Smith,

                    Nicolas Cousté and Jean Cousin worked together on Charles
                    IX’s royal entry into Sens in 1563. Several entries in the

                <p>A comparison between Ms. Fr. 640 and master goldsmith
                    Cellini’s <em>Trattati dell’ Oreficeria e della
                        scultura</em> (completed by 1565, published 1568) is
                    instructive: Cellini gives firsthand accounts of making
                    objects ranging from jewelers’ work such as seals and
                    jewelry to goldsmiths’ work such as vessels and sculpture,
                    as well as the unusual (for a goldsmith) work of larger than
                    life bronze statuary. Ms. Fr. 640 describes the making of
                    portrait medals, a few references to his seemingly larger
                    sculpture, casting small objects from life, a few details of
                    jewelry making, but nothing about vessels.<a href="#fnref27"

                <p>Probably authored by Girolamo Ruscelli (1500–1566). Ruscelli
                    claimed in <em>Secreti nuovi</em> (1567) that he and other
                    like-minded academicians employed artisans to record and

                    Although editions of Piemontese varied considerably in
                    content, the original Italian as well as the French and
