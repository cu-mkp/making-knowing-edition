        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <div>
            <p>This essay explores the ambiguous meanings of aquafortis, of its
                constituent ingredients, and of the units of measurement listed
                in “For making aquafortis” on fol. <a
                   href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/75r/f/75r/tl"><u>75r</u></a>.
                By situating the recipe within a broader historical context,
                aquafortis can be understood as a substance with the ability to
                interact with solids, and perform actions such as dissolve or
                corrode metals. Comparison of the recipe in Ms. Fr. 640 with
                contemporary textual sources gives insight into the variety of
                uses for aquafortis and the various ingredients for making it.
                This indicates that the term copperas refers to any sulfate
                (vitriol), and <em>solle</em> refers to salt (NaCl) rather than
                saltpeter. The genres of texts containing aquafortis recipes
                reveal that the recipes in Ms. Fr. 640 bear comparison with a
                variety of literary traditions: alchemical manuscripts,
                metallurgical treatises, treatises on arts, and books of
                secrets. Finally, the recipe for aquafortis on fol. 75r was
                reconstructed, which showed the efficacy of the recipe and its
                correspondence with contemporary expectations about aquafortis.

    <p>Aquafortis, or “strong water,” has been commonly interpreted by
        historians to mean nitric acid. In fact, the term “aqua” was used in the
        medieval and early modern period to denote any kind of liquid; thus the
        meaning of aquafortis is often ambiguous, and does not solely denote
        nitric acid, as this essay makes clear.<a href="#fn1"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref1"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> Aquafortis eludes precise
        categorization due to its variety of uses, as well as the variety of
        recipes for making it.</p>
    <p>Numerous entries in BnF Ms. Fr. 640 require the use of aquafortis
        (<em>eau fort</em>). These include “Color of damascene steel on knives”
        (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/11v/f/11v/tl"><u>11v</u></a>)
        which describes rubbing steel with aquafortis mixed with clay; recipes
        “For eating away and dissolving entirely pure gold” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/104r/f/104r/tl"><u>104r</u></a>)
        and “Augmenting the color of gold” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/166v/f/166v/tl"><u>166v</u></a>);
        “Very light and hollow work of gold,” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/156r/f/156r/tl"><u>156r</u></a>),
        in which the aquafortis should “eat away” silver, but leave pure gold
        unharmed; and even as a suggestion for how <em>not</em> to kill “snakes
        for molding” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/109v/f/109v/tl"><u>109v</u></a>).
        The use of aquafortis was common in the laboratory of the medieval and
        early modern alchemist, as well as in the workshops of many
        practitioners working with metals.</p>
    <p>On fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/75r/f/75r/tl"><u>75r</u></a>,
        the author-practitioner includes a recipe for aquafortis, which
        instructs to “take a half-septier of vinegar with one ounce of
        verdigris, &amp; one ounce of copperas &amp; one ounce of solle, then
        put them together in a glass vial.” The point of departure for this
        essay is an investigation of the materials contained in this aquafortis
        recipe by comparison with other contemporary sources. These include
        alchemical manuscripts, books of secrets, and metallurgical treatises,
        which reveal a wide variety of recipes, uses, and literary genres that
        incorporated recipes for aquafortis. By placing the recipe within a
        broader historical context, we can make better sense of aquafortis and
        its ingredients in the manuscript and enrich our understanding of the
        manuscript as a whole.</p>
    <p>The second part of the essay describes the reconstruction of the recipe
        for aquafortis in the manuscript. In order to determine the efficacy of
        the recipe, the reconstruction connects with other entries in the
        manuscript. “Color of damascene steel on knives” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/11v/f/11v/tl"><u>11v</u></a>)
        in particular provides an internal reference to test the reconstructed
        aquafortis. It describes the application of aquafortis on steel,
        allowing us to assess the qualities of different kinds of aquafortis
        through their effects in comparison with their presumed purpose.</p>
    <p>The recipe for aquafortis on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/75r/f/75r/tl"><u>75r</u></a>
        requires a demi-septier of vinegar, an ounce of copperas, verdigris, and
        <em>solle</em>. These materials raise several questions both
        independently and in relation to one another. What the
        author-practitioner refers to as “copperas,” for example, is ambiguous,
        and the meaning of the word <em>solle</em>, which does not repeat again
        in the manuscript, is unclear. Other ingredients such as saltpeter,
        common in the making of aquafortis, are missing. Furthermore, the
        interactions between these materials raise the question of what the
        resulting aquafortis is. No less a matter for investigation are the
        units of measure the author-practitioner used in the recipe.</p>
    <p>As units of measure varied regionally, and even within regions, during
        the ancien régime, the meaning of the measures “demi-septier” (<em>demy
            sestier</em>) and “ounce” (<em>once</em>) on fol. <a

    <p>The distinction between <em>septier</em> and <em>demi-septier</em> is
        made clear in Randle Cotgrave’s <em>Dictionary of the French and English

        was not, however, half of a <em>septier</em> as its name suggests. As
        Cotgrave further explains, the <em>demi-septier</em> <em>de vin</em> is
        equivalent to half a <em>chopine</em>, which in turn is a Parisian
        half-pint, meaning that the <em>demi-setier</em> is roughly 250ml.<a

    <p>The recipe for aquafortis in the <em>Liber de inventione veritatis</em>
        is comparable to another recipe in the <em>Liber fornacum</em>. The
        recipe in the <em>Liber fornacum</em> instructs to distil “filings of

        (Venus) and iron sulfate (Mars), both of which are called vitriols.
        These two compounds in the <em>Liber fornacum</em> recipe provide

        occurs in a variety of other sources, such as in Georgius Agricola’s

        which emphasizes direct observation and experience in combination with
        ancient sources.<a href="#fn18"

        gold and silver. In the first recipe, “the use of which is common and

        in the process of distillation allow us to begin to see how aquafortis
        did not refer to any one specific chemical compound.</p>
    <p>Biringuccio discusses the distillation of aquafortis and also proposes a
        recipe for an <em>aqua acuta</em> (“acute water”)—an acid for parting
        gold and silver that calls for one part well-refined saltpeter and three
        times as much well-washed rock alum.<a href="#fn22"

    <p>Agricola’s vitriol requirement is ambiguous. Vitriols were mainly
        distinguished according to their colors: the green powder of iron(II)
        sulfate gained the name green vitriol, the blue powder of copper(II)
        sulfate was labeled blue vitriol, and the white powder of zinc sulfate

    <p>The author-practitioner himself makes a similar distinction in “A way for
        molding excellently with water” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/83v/f/83v/tl"><u>83v</u></a>),
        in which he writes “do the same with vitriol &amp; copperas, which, once
        well calcined, reduce in water,” thereby differentiating vitriol and
        copperas but employing the two substances for the same purpose. Whether
        he meant them as overlapping terms or whether he conceived of copperas
        as being clearly distinct from other vitriols remains unclear. It seems
        that when the type of sulfate is pertinent, the type of vitriol is
        directly mentioned. The author-practitioner does this in the recipe for

    <p>Vitriols were used in many different contexts, one of which is mentioned
        in a manuscript compiled by Friar Giovanni Andrea in 1562 in Lucca,
        titled <em>Libro dei Secreti e Ricette</em> (Book of secrets and
        recipes), also known as the “Gesuatti Manuscript.”<a href="#fn28"

    <p>A fourteenth-century manuscript from Bologna contains two recipes that
        shed more light on the use of vitriols in recipes for aquafortis. The
        first, for <em>aqua corrosiva</em> (“corrosive water”), notes that
        aquafortis “reduces the weight of the body brought about from the salt
        of ammonium (saltpeter) and of copperas in equal proportions [when]
        distilled in still water.” The second, for <em>aqua solvens</em>
        (“dissolving water”) to dissolve “silver and indeed other metals,” is
        made from “<em>vitriollo romano</em> and saltpeter in equal parts, and
        this water dissolves iron.”<a href="#fn32"

           id="fnref32"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
    <p>The two recipes from the Bologna manuscript describe the use of two
        sulfates, <em>vitriollo romano</em> and <em>coperosa</em>, in two
        different recipes for aquafortis.<a href="#fn33"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref33"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a> According to Biringuccio, Roman
        vitriol “is not well vitrified and clear and is not of the same lovely

        beautiful, and the best,” with the exception of Massa vitriol.<a

           id="fnref35"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>35</sup></a> The ambiguous nature of the term
        Roman vitriol in the early modern period stresses the importance of the
        indication of the color of the vitriol. This might indicate that by

        author-practitioner was not assuming tacit knowledge but allowing the
        reader to choose from the vitriols available since any of them would
        work.</p>
    <p>Roman vitriol is also mentioned in a recipe for aquafortis in Benvenuto
        Cellini’s <em>Treatises on Goldsmithing and Sculpture</em> published in
        1568.<a href="#fn36"

        alembic.”<a href="#fn37"

        Biringuccio mentions that some prefer to add Roman vitriol to
        aquafortis, further highlighting the diversity of recipes and the
        difficulty in defining aquafortis in terms of chemical composition.<a

    <p>As this overview of recipes shows, aquafortis could be many things and
        made of many different ingredients. The author practitioner seems to
        have been aware of this: in a recipe for “Augmenting the Color of Gold”
        (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/166v/f/166v/tl"><u>166v</u></a>),
        he specifically recommends using “aquafortis of vitriol,” suggesting
        that he was aware of the different varieties of aquafortis, and perhaps
        even of the employment of different recipes for different uses.<a

    <p>The entry on fol. 166v resembles another recipe for a similar purpose
        prescribing aquafortis. Leonardo da Vinci’s <em>Codex Atalanticus</em>
        (ca. 1480) provides a recipe for “tinging works of gold,” with
        instructions to put vitriol, verdigris, and saltpeter in a crucible with
        the object one wants to tinge.<a href="#fn40"

           id="fnref40"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>40</sup></a> The process is similar to the
        entry in Ms. Fr. 640, which says to heat aquafortis of vitriol and to
        “cover the bottle, that is to say, the mouth, with a tile, then unstop
        it &amp; thick fumes will come out; put the gold on this and it will
        take on a high color” (fol. <a

    <p>William Newman points out that a similar recipe is given in an alchemical
        manuscript by a fifteenth-century Neapolitan printer named Arnaldus de
        Bruxella, thus further widening the scope and geographic expanse through
        which we can begin to understand Ms. Fr. 640.<a href="#fn41"

    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>The author-practitioner, in contradicting
        Arnaldus by suggesting not to use aquafortis for this purpose, provides

        artisanal purpose: molding snakes.</p>
    <h2 id="application-of-aquafortis-on-metal">Application of Aquafortis on

    <p>The uses of aquafortis thus ranged widely, as can also be seen in Ms. Fr.

    <p>The <em>Summa perfectionis</em> provides another interesting example of a
        paste used to enrich or purify gold (or at least its surface). The

        in its mode of application of the sharp paste.</p>
    <p>In order to test the author-practitioner’s recipe for aquafortis, I
        selected the entry for applying the color of damascene steel on knives
        (fol. <a

        There, the author-practitioner tells his reader to mix aquafortis with
        earth and rub it on the steel, and then to rub the steel with ashes or
        sand. He suggests that gold and silver will behave on the resulting
        surface as they would on a touchstone.</p>
    <p>For the purposes of this essay, I will only consider the materials in the
        recipe and not the color application process or meaning. As we have
        established, the fundamental property that binds together the category
        of aquafortis is the substance’s potency to act on lesser metals than
        gold. The recipe called for a demi-septier of vinegar with one ounce of
        verdigris, one ounce of copperas, and one ounce of <em>solle</em>, mixed
        together in a glass vial. Since the entry on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/11v/f/11v/tl"><u>11v</u></a>
        describes a knife, I used three plates of bloomery steel.<a href="#fn50"

    <p>Since the author-practitioner did not specify the type of copperas, I
        used two vitriols in the reconstruction: blue vitriol (copper(II)
        sulphate) and green vitriol (iron(II) sulfate). I also tested nitric
        acid (50%) based on previous historical reconstructions of aquafortis
        recipes.<a href="#fn51"

        wine vinegar (~8% acetic acid), a substance that was also known in the

    <p>After crushing thirty grams (one ounce) of verdigris into fine grains, I
        poured them slowly into a beaker containing 250 ml (demi-septier) of

        sulfate to the liquid. The liquid remained the same blue color. Once 30
        grams of salt were added, upon a couple of stirs, the liquid immediately
        turned yellow/brown, a color characteristic of iron(II) chloride (<i><u>Fig. 3</u></i>). I then put the mixture aside.</p>

        red underneath the paste (<i><u>Fig. 5</u></i>). Next, I rubbed the
        paste off the bloomery steel plate using sand—I chose commercial play
        sand based on its abrasive and absorbent qualities—which helped clean
        the surface of the steel quickly and efficiently. I then repeated the
        process with the aquafortis containing iron(II) sulfate, and with 50%
        nitric acid, the latter of which produced a noticeable amount of heat.
        These pastes were also applied to modern medium carbon steel
        (0.29%–0.54% carbon, with 0.60%–1.65% manganese). The nitric acid paste
        immediately bubbled on applying it to the modern steel (<i><u>Fig. 6</u></i>).</p>

    <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The comparison of historical recipes reveals that there is no standard
        recipe for aquafortis and no standard compound to which it refers. The
        author-practitioner’s recipe for aquafortis does not produce nitric
        acid, yet it is still a corrosive, thereby reaffirming the multiplicity
        of meanings of the substance and its ingredients, inflected by
        tradition, tacit knowledge, and ad-hoc solutions. The reconstruction and
        historical contextualization of the recipe for aquafortis allow us to
        better understand the materials invoked in the recipe for aquafortis on
        fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/75r/f/75r/tl"><u>75r</u></a>,
        as well as to recognize that aquafortis was a category, rather than a
        specific compound in the medieval and early modern period.</p>

                    were to the materials being measured. Indeed, the units of

                <p>Testa states that copperas is a synonym for iron(II) sulfate.

                <p>Cellini’s literary works, manifesting the early modern
                    fascination with the natural world, may well have been
                    intended to transmit secret knowledge to a select group of
                    people, but also to create himself as a man with knowledge
