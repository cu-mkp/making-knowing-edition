        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <div>
            <p>Among the many recipes in Ms. Fr. 640 for making gold color, an
                unusual one entitled “For making very beautiful color of gold
                &amp; of little expense,” on fol. <a
                   href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/76v/f/76v/tl"><u>76v</u></a>
                calls for mixing ground orange peel with sulfur. The
                reconstruction of this recipe did not result in “a very
                beautiful color,” but more experimentation is necessary.</p>

    <h2 id="gold-colors">Gold Colors</h2>
    <p>Ms. Fr. 640 contains many entries for creating the color of gold. Some of
        these involve no gold at all, such as “Color of gold without gold on
        silver” (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/29v/f/29v/tl"><u>29v</u></a>),
        “For making bronze in gold color” (fols. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/73r/f/73r/tl"><u>73r</u></a>
        and <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/78v/f/78v/tl"><u>78v</u></a>),
        “Gold color” (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/100r/f/100r/tl"><u>100r</u></a>),
        and “Good mixture to color gold” (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/104r/f/104r/tl"><u>104r</u></a>).
        Some contain no gold, but are intended to enhance the effects of applied
        gold, such as “Seat for gold” (fol. 29v), which involves mixing ground
        yellow pigments with glue to make a mordant onto which gold leaf is to
        be applied. Other recipes involve applying gold leaf—elemental gold that
        has been hammered into thin sheets—or making elemental gold into pigment
        for writing or painting in gold. The author-practitioner discusses
        gilding with gold leaf at many points in the manuscript, and he provides
        two different processes to prepare gold for painting and writing, both
        of which he calls “or moulu” (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/8v/f/8v/tl"><u>8v</u></a>
        and fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/75r/f/75r/tl"><u>75r</u></a>).<a

    <blockquote>

                expense</strong>

            grind all together, and put everything in a glass vial, &amp; keep
            them in the cellar or other damp place for the space of eight or ten
            days. Then when you want to use it, one needs to warm it and use it
            where you want, &amp; you will see a very beautiful color.</p>

    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>This recipe is included within a section
        of Ms. Fr. 640 written by a scribe (fols. 73r–76v), which contains many
        short recipes for coloring diverse materials. Unusually for Ms. Fr. 640,
        the recipe appears to have been copied almost verbatim from the
        pseudonymous Alessio Piemontese’s book of secrets. A comparison between
        this recipe and a 1559 French edition of Piemontese shows marked
        similarity:</p>

        orange, and Valencia orange (<i><u>Fig. 1</u></i>).<a href="#fn5"

    <h3 id="reconstruction-i">Reconstruction I</h3>
    <p>We undertook two reconstructions of the experiment. The first step was to
        “take very yellow orange peel, &amp; clean them well of the white that
        is inside, &amp; pulverize them very well <del>and</del> <sup>in</sup> a
        very clean mortar.” We washed the oranges and removed the zest with a
        knife (<i><u>Fig. 2</u></i>). We ground half the peels from each type of
        orange individually in a “very clean mortar” while they were still wet (<i><u>Fig. 3</u></i>), and the other halves were placed aside to be
        dried. We ground the peels for about ten minutes to a paste and then, as
        called for in the recipe, we added an equal amount of sulfur. The
        mixtures were then ground for an additional ten minutes until the peel
        and sulfur were fully combined.</p>

    <p>We then followed the instructions to “put everything in a glass vial,
        &amp; keep them in the cellar or other damp place for the space of eight
        or ten days” by placing the three mixtures in individual glass beakers.
        We put these unsealed beakers into a closed container with about an inch
        of water standing at the bottom (<i><u>Fig. 4</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 5</u></i>). We stored the beakers in the lab refrigerator at approximately
        5°C, for eight days. On removing the mixtures, we noted that they had
        absorbed some of the water. The pulverized mixture was moist to the
        touch and compacted more easily than before being left to sit. We
        observed no change in color.</p>

    <p>Following the directive that “when you want to use it, one needs to warm
        it,” we heated the mixtures to various temperatures. We heated the
        mixture of Valencia and sulfur to a temperature at which to melt the
        sulfur (115.2°C). This mixture ignited and burned off (<i><u>Fig. 6</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 7</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 8</u></i>). We then slowly heated
        the navel orange and sulfur mixture for ten minutes with a target
        temperature just over the melting point of sulfur. The substance browned
        and the mixture blackened even before we reached 110°C (<i><u>Fig. 9</u></i>). The mixture was then heated with a target temperature of 100°C,
        and again the mixture turned brown, although this time, it retained a
        yellowish cast (<i><u>Fig. 10</u></i>).</p>

    <p>We decided to make an additional trial of a recipe for a gold color with
        an organic material as its base. This recipe from Phillip’s <em>A Booke
            of Secrets</em> is supposed to produce a “good gold colour” using
        aloe: “A good&nbsp;gold colour. Take linseed oile, put into it a

    <p>In our second reconstruction, the procedure remained almost the same,
        except that we dried the orange peels for approximately two weeks and
        then ground them into a fine powder, an operation that took the aid of
        several others in the lab (<i><u>Fig. 13</u></i>). This powder was
        combined with an equal amount of sulfur, and half the mixture was placed
        in a glass flask in a sealed container with an inch of water at the
        bottom, and kept in the refrigerator at about 5°C. We combined the other
        half with linseed oil and painted out the result onto the stucco models
        (<i><u>Fig. 14</u></i>). The result might possibly be called “a very
        beautiful color,” although it still contained particles and had a coarse
        consistency (somewhat less visible than in the previous trial).</p>

    <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Lack of time ended our trials with this test of the dried orange peel and
        sulfur mixture. We realized that in our first reconstruction, our
        expectation that the sulfur was the important coloring agent led us to
        heat the mixture to a point where the sulfur would melt. As noted, this
        caused the mixture to turn brown. Out of this failure, we realized it
        would be fruitful to experiment with warming (<em>chauffer</em>) the
        mixture rather than heating (<em>cuire</em> or <em>recuire</em>) it. We
        did not, however, have time to carry out this test, and we leave it to
        our curious readers to try it themselves.</p>
