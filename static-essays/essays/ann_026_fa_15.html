                is one of the few entries in Ms. Fr. 640 that concerns itself
                with the making of craft tools. By the sixteenth century,
                paintbrushes (also known as “pencils”) could be purchased
                ready-made by specialist artisans. Yet technical manuals and
                treatises on the art of painting continued to include
                instructions to make them in the workshop. By reconstructing the
                recipe and situating it in relation to contemporary recipes for
                brush making, this essay concludes that the level of detail and
                ready-to-hand materials in “Paintbrushes” suggests the
                author-practitioner at least witnessed brush making and perhaps
                even attempted it himself.</p>

    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
    <p>Research into the materials used in sixteenth-century artists’s workshops
        is made possible by the survival of many artworks of the period.
        Research into the tools used to create these works, however, is more
        challenging because tools are likely to be used until they are no longer
        functional and then discarded. This essay examines the instructions for
        brush making in the entry “Paintbrushes” (“<em>Pinceaulx</em>”) on fols.
        <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/66v/f/66v/tl"><u>66v</u></a>–<a

        of Ms. Fr. 640. This particular recipe is an especially useful case
        study for historical reconstruction for two reasons: first, because of
        the lack of surviving brushes from the period; and second, as historian
        Jo Kirby has noted, “there is little information on brushes in [the late
        sixteenth century], and what exists is rather widely dispersed.”<a

           role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> Our fabrication of paintbrushes
        based on the directions given starting on fol. 66v gives insight into
        the descriptions, requirements, and instructions regarding brushes found
        in related primary source literature; our reconstruction can be seen as
        a form of supplementary evidence from a practical standpoint to address
        the lacuna in the historical record.</p>
    <p>Many recipes in Ms. Fr. 640 detail techniques of painting, glazing, and
        gilding. These would have supported contemporary workshop practices,
        which required artisans to know how to use both workshop-made and
        ready-bought materials and pigments to produce various colors and
        effects.<a href="#fn2"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref2"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> In contrast, the inclusion in the
        manuscript of the recipe for making paintbrushes, what the manuscript
        refers to as <em>pinceaulx</em> or what English sources would call
        “pencils” until the mid-nineteenth century, is not quite as easily
        explained.<a href="#fn3"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref3"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> The entry is unusual within the
        manuscript, as it is one of the few times we are told how to make the

           id="fnref4"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> Given the centrality of tools to
        the various activities of sixteenth-century artisans, and even the use
        of brushes and paintbrushes in diverse spheres of artisanal work across
        the manuscript, the author-practitioner’s comparative lack of concern
        for their manufacture is somewhat surprising. As historian Susie Nash
        notes, “indeed tools, as much as if not more than materials, were often
        the defining feature of a craft, and the means by which guild membership
        was often dictated.”<a href="#fn5"

    <p>This essay therefore addresses a key historical question raised by the
        inclusion of this recipe within the manuscript: were artists in France
        in this period making their own brushes, or buying them ready-made? If
        they were buying their brushes, why include the instructions for making
        them in the manuscript? And, whether the brushes are being made or
        purchased, how does this recipe help us understand the practice of
        painting and crafting techniques within the world of Ms. Fr. 640?</p>
    <h2 id="brush-making-in-europe">Brush Making in Europe</h2>
    <p>Textual descriptions for brush making are not as common as instructions
        for other techniques related to painting, such as, for example,
        varnishing or gilding. That said, various extant sources discuss this
        topic, namely, those by Cennino Cennini (late fourteenth-century),
        Cipriano Piccolpasso (1548), Valentin Boltz von Rufach (1549), and Henry
        Gyles (1664), all of whom address the making of brushes in some
        detail.<a href="#fn7"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref7"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> The peculiarities of the recipe
        from Ms. Fr. 640 emerge when comparing it with these sources. As this
        section will demonstrate, understanding the intended use of a
        brush-making recipe is not always apparent from the text of the book or
        manuscript itself.</p>
    <p>Cennini instructs the reader on how to make both miniver and hogs’
        bristle brushes under the section heading, “The Importance of Knowing
        How to Make Brushes,” which he commences with the assertion, “first you
        have to learn how to make these brushes.”<a href="#fn8"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref8"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> This could imply that the reader
        was intended to actually fabricate the brushes, but we can also
        understand this chapter within the overall program of <em>Il libro
            dell’arte</em>, which conveys the art of painting from the
        descriptions of fundamental techniques and preparation of the most basic
        materials through to more complex workshop practices and products. It is
        possible, however, that Cennini intended merely to aid the reader (i.e.,
        “anyone who wish[es] to enter this profession”)<a href="#fn9"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref9"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> in choosing brushes and appearing
        knowledgeable about the craft of painting. Cennini differs from the
        authors of later seventeenth-century painters’ manuals, who explicitly
        intended to instruct gentleman painters and to “enable them to speak on
        the subject of painting with propriety, and without incurring
        ridicule.”<a href="#fn10"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref10"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> It seems likely, however, that
        Cennini, with his more practically oriented text, considered knowledge
        of brush making necessary to be fully versed in the painter’s craft.</p>
    <p>Certainly, Cennini’s contemporaries in France seem to have made their own
        brushes, or at least delegated the task to their assistants. In 1399,
        merchant Pierre Berbisey sold pigs’ bristles and wire to artist Jean
        Malouel to make “broisses,” and swan quills for making “pinceaux.”
        Again, in 1402, Berbisey delivered a shipment of brush-making materials
        to Malouel. Berbisey was not a specialist trader, and his supply of raw
        materials to make artists’ brushes (both <em>pinceaux</em> and
        <em>brosses</em>) in the 1390s indicates that at least some artists were
        not buying their brushes ready-made.<a href="#fn11"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref11"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> However, Gerald Ward argues that
        Cennini’s description about how to make brushes “is perfunctory and hard
        to follow and does not appear to reflect any first-hand knowledge of the
        technique.”<a href="#fn12"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref12"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> In our experience, the
        information Cennini provides is sufficient for modern readers with
        little craft expertise to undertake a reconstruction; presumably, it was
        more than sufficient to supplement the knowledge and instruction already
        available to someone working within an early modern workshop.</p>
    <p>As Jo Wheeler notes, by the fifteenth century, most Florentine artists
        were not making their own brushes: “Instead, they bought them ready made
        from apothecaries or specialist makers. Artists such as Lorenzo Lotto
        and Titian in sixteenth-century Venice purchased such brushes from the
        city’s famed color sellers.”<a href="#fn13"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref13"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> For Italian artists, the
        practice of buying <em>pennelli</em> (paintbrushes) was so widespread
        that by 1587, in his manual <em>De vera precetti dela pittura</em>,
        Giovani Battista Armenini excuses his excision of miniver brush-making
        instructions, stating that “they are sold everywhere in shops and by
        apothecaries; among the best are those which come from Venice.”<a
           href="#fn14"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref14"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> Similarly, the inventory of the
        Venetian merchant Jacopo de’ Benedetti (who died in 1594) shows that he
        regularly sold ready-made brushes of all sorts, including brushes in
        quills, pigs’ hair brushes, and fine hair brushes for miniature
        painting. As Roland Krischel notes with regard to the inventory, “this
        wide choice reminds us that Venetian brushes had a far-ranging
        reputation.”<a href="#fn15"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref15"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> There is evidence that Venetian
        brushes traveled through Europe beyond Italy; Tintoretto, for example,
        bought Venetian brushes for the Spanish court in 1577.<a href="#fn16"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref16"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> By 1586, brush-making had become
        a specialized profession in Augsburg, where <em>pinselmacher</em> appear
        to have been on the cutting edge of specialized manufacture, using metal
        ferrules in place of quills to hold the hairs of the brushes in place.<a

        brushes, artists’ brushes of squirrel fur, artists’ brushes of polecat,

    <p>The early modern interest in the art of painting led to a growing body of
        manuscript and printed technical literature, which emerged as a distinct
        literary genre by the late sixteenth century. Little is known, however,
        about the intended and real audience for these books. Valentin Boltz von
        Ruffach’s <em>Illuminier Buoch</em> (Basel, 1549), for instance,
        includes, among its many recipes for paints and its scores of woodcuts
        modeling the subjects of art, a very detailed description of how brushes
        are made;<a href="#fn19"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref19"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a> however, much as is the question
        with Cennini, it is uncertain whether these instructions were intended
        to be followed. By the seventeenth century, manuals appear to be
        explicitly directed to the amateur painter, and they too delineated the
        methods and tools for amateur painting. These didactic texts include
        Henry Peacham’s <em>Art of Drawing with the Pen</em> and his
        <em>Compleat Gentleman</em> (London, 1622), Etienne Binet’s <em>Essay
            des merveilles de nature, et des plus nobles artifices</em> (Rouen,
        1621, under the pseudonym of René Françoise, which formed the basis for
        Pierre Le Brun’s 1635 manuscript, “Recuil des Essaies des Merveilles de
        la Peinture”), Edward Norgate’s manuscript on illumination and miniature
        painting, “Miniatura or the Art of Limning” (written 1627, and
        circulated widely in manuscript), William Sanderson’s <em>Graphice</em>
        (London 1658, in large part based on Norgate’s widely-copied
        manuscript), William Salmon’s <em>Polygraphice</em> (London, 1672), the
        anonymous “The Excellency of Pen and Pencil” (published in London in
        1688), and York glass painter Henry Gyles’ 1664 manuscript on painting.
        It is noteworthy that of all these later English works, only the last
        two instruct the reader in how to make brushes.</p>
    <p>Although a handful of early modern texts address brush making in detail,
        they nevertheless leave the modern reader with questions, particularly
        about the kind of animal hairs required for fine paintbrushes and the
        means to secure those hairs. While Cennini recommends that the miniver
        brushes (i.e., the equivalent of the author-practitioner’s
        <em>pinceaulx</em>) be made using miniver tails and quills, Cipriano
        Piccolpasso proposes different kinds of materials. In his <em>Li tre
            libri dell’arte del vasaio</em>—a description of the techniques of
        maiolica production authored around 1557 likely at the request of
        Cardinal François de Tournon—Piccolpasso discusses the kind of
        paintbrushes used by maiolica painters. These are made out of either the
        hair of a goat or an ass, and bound and lashed onto handles with waxed
        yarn. Yet while Piccolpasso provides one of the few early modern
        descriptions of brush-making, his method does not incorporate a quill
        ferrule to secure the hair fibers, though the brushes he describes as
        <em>penelli</em> resemble <em>pinceaulx</em> (<i><u>Fig. 2</u></i>). In
        contrast to Cennini, whose instructions call for the use of the end of
        the miniver’s tail, Gyles does not recommend using the tips of the tail
        fur to make “pensills”: “The tip of the end of the tayle is not for
        making pensills on because the haires are crooked bending toward the
        poynts, but all the other haire above that joint is usefull.”<a

    <p>If the advice about brush hair was ambiguous, then the advice about how
        to bind that hair could be just as divergent. Most authors recommended
        the use of some sort of ferrule. Indeed, the use of quills to serve as
        ferrules is what gives the “pencil” its name and thus shares an origin
        with the word “pen.”<a href="#fn21"

    <p>Once hair and ferrule were procured, the former had to make its way into
        the latter. Gyles suggests placing the hairs in a cylinder and arranging
        them by tapping the cylinder until the hairs are arranged, then clipping
        the bunch at the roots.<a href="#fn27"

        that the hair comes together &amp; is rendered the same length.”
        Nevertheless, several of Gyles’ recommendations are idiosyncratic, and
        this might be an indication that Gyles may have come up with his
        processes himself after trial and error, and intended the instructions
        to be used for brush making. As Robert Tittler notes, access to
        specially made <em>pinceaulx</em> in England during the sixteenth and
        seventeenth centuries varied with locale. While fine painting materials
        were relatively easy to procure in London, where <em>pinceaulx</em> were
        typically imported from abroad, places further afield (like York) often
        had to make do with home-made materials.<a href="#fn28"

    <p>In sum, clues about the geography of workshop-made and ready-made brushes
        before the eighteenth century are fragmentary yet suggestive. Hugo van
        der Goes’s <em>St. Luke Drawing the Virgin</em> (1480) shows two
        <em>pinceaulx</em> placed on the saint’s window ledge, while beside him
        on the floor lies a bird wing and a knife, which Nash believes was so
        placed as to suggest that St. Luke made the <em>pinceaulx</em>
        immediately prior to painting (<i><u>Fig. 3</u></i>).<a href="#fn30"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref30"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a> In 1521 in Antwerp, Albrecht
        Dürer is recorded as having bought “13 bristle [brushes] ready-made for
        6 stivers, 6 bristle brushes for 3 stivers, and then another 3 stivers
        for another 3 bristle brushes,” demonstrating that even by the early
        sixteenth century, at least some masters were relying on specially made
        brushes rather than brushes made in their own workshop. Tittler notes
        that the brush makers’ trade had become so specialized in Antwerp and
        Augsburg, that “by the latter decades of the sixteenth century, it
        allowed for distinctions to be made between those who made the coarser,
        bristle brushes, and the finer ‘pencil’ brushes.”<a href="#fn31"

        despite the developing profession of brush-making, many
        sixteenth-century artists likely made their own brushes. It was almost
        certainly an important skill for apprentices to acquire, a skill which
        many masters likely knew and they perhaps preferred to construct their
        brushes in accord with their own needs.<a href="#fn32"

        Flemish painters, the reader is advised, are particularly careful to
        avoid having hairs from the brush stick to the painting, indicating that
        the danger of hairs detaching from the <em>pinceau</em> was as present
        in the sixteenth century as it was in our reconstruction.</p>
    <h2 id="reconstruction">Reconstruction</h2>
    <h3 id="materials-and-tools">Materials and Tools</h3>
    <p>The recipe in Ms. Fr. 640 uses the word <em>gris</em> (squirrel) to
        indicate the sort of fur that is to be used in making the paintbrushes
        or “pencils” (<em>pinceaulx</em>): “To make them well, cut the hair from
        the tail of a squirrel’s fur, as much in one go as one can hold in a
        card folded up like a cannule.” We found the translation of
        <em>gris</em> as squirrel to be plausible but potentially ambiguous.
        Other literature, both primary and secondary sources, on the subject of
        materials used in brush-making helped us to circumscribe the problem.
        Harley notes, for instance, that “there is generally no problem in
        knowing when reference is made to bristle brushes, but it is sometimes
        difficult to establish exactly what raw material is indicated in
        connection with soft hair brushes.”<a href="#fn34"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref34"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a> Cennini specifies “minever”
        brushes, and sixteenth-century English sources generally refer to
        miniver or calaber tails for brush making; however, Norgate, writing in
        1620, refers only to miniver. Gyles notes that calaber fur is finer than
        an English squirrel’s, which indicates that the two are not identical,
        while miniver appears to be related to ermine.<a href="#fn35"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref35"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>35</sup></a> Ward notes that the term
        “miniver” was used to indicate any sort of grey fur that could come from
        a stoat (also known as ermine) or a squirrel.<a href="#fn36"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref36"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>36</sup></a> The important thing is that the
        brush hair be fine, flexible, and able to be shaped into a fine point.
        If the animal indicated in fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/66v/f/66v/tl"><u>66v</u></a>
        is indeed a squirrel, it is almost certainly not one of Gyles’ inferior
        English squirrels, whose fur was more difficult to shape into a fine
        point. From this perspective, it is possible that Ms. Fr. 640 points to
        the Siberian squirrel.<a href="#fn37"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref37"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>37</sup></a> Its fur was prized by brush
        makers in the sixteenth and subsequent centuries, as its quality created
        especially fine-tipped brushes.<a href="#fn38"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref38"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>38</sup></a> Alternatively, following Ward,
        it is possible that <em>gris</em> merely refers to any animal with a
        grey tail suitable for brush making. To further complicate the question,
        the pelt of the red squirrel from Germany and France changes to a
        greyish color in the winter months. Thus, it is possible that the recipe
        in Ms. Fr. 640 refers to a red squirrel whose fur has turned grey in
        winter.</p>
    <p>For our reconstruction, we obtained a grey American squirrel tail from an
        online retailer, as squirrel tail fur is still used to craft flies for
        fly fishing. Our reconstruction supported the difficulty in bringing the
        squirrel <em>pinceau</em> to a point, which Gyles mentioned as being a
        drawback of using squirrel fur. While it is difficult to parse whether
        the shortcomings of our brush were due to our novice brush-making skills
        or the quality of the fur, the fact remains that our brush fibers had a
        tendency to spread, making fine-pointed work difficult to execute.</p>
    <p>The author-practitioner of Ms. Fr. 640 does not specify what sort of bird
        is to be used to procure a ferrule, saying only a “quill whose size is
        appropriate, of a duck or a crow for the small ones.” For our
        reconstruction, we used quills from the wing of a Canada goose, which
        Professor Pamela Smith picked up along the Charles River in Cambridge,
        Massachusetts. The manuscript also specifies using silk thread, but
        given the unexpected difficulty of finding silk thread in shops near
        Columbia University, our reconstruction used a similarly water-resistant
        polyester thread.</p>
    <h3 id="technique">Technique</h3>
    <p>Our reconstruction diverges from the instructions provided by the
        author-practitioner of Ms. Fr. 640 in two important ways. First, while
        Cennini recommends using multiple bundles of hair to construct the
        brush, the author-practitioner recommends the use of only one large
        bundle of hair that is tied and inserted into the quill. Because we were
        concerned that the weight of the pigments in oil would drag the brush
        fibers out of the quill (an issue we already experienced with modern
        brushes), we chose to use multiple bundles of hair. This method had the
        additional advantage of allowing us to shape the brush, as arranging a
        brush with a large bundle of free hair proved maddeningly difficult.
        Second, while the author-practitioner does not mention the necessity of
        boiling the quills prior to mounting the hair, Ward mentions boiling the
        quills as a common practice.<a href="#fn39"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref39"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>39</sup></a> Both Boltz von Ruffach and Gyles
        similarly recommend soaking the quills in lukewarm water, with Boltz
        noting that this is done to render the quills pliable.<a href="#fn40"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref40"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
    <p>Having acquired our squirrel tail, we began by cutting the hair into
        bundles of roughly twenty to twenty-five hairs, cutting them off close
        to the tailbone as the manuscript prescribes, producing bundles roughly
        one millimeter in diameter.<a href="#fn41"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref41"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>41</sup></a> The author-practitioner goes on
        to say:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Put one or two bristles of a rat’s whiskers in the middle, then,
            grabbing it with the fist &amp; pinching it well with the thumb
            &amp; index finger, thoroughly wet the tip of all this hair in
            water, then, moving close to the light, pull out the hairs which
            make the tip too long with the ends of your fingernails, and this
            until the tip seems good to you, &amp; until you notice in it the
            rat hairs which are entirely black &amp; the hair of the petit-gris
            is <del>at the</del> whitish from the root to the middle.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>Keeping these bundles held tightly between
        our fingers, we stripped the shorter “guard hairs” from the bundle
        before wetting it in clear water. Once it was wet, it was much easier to
        handle, as this caused all the hairs to cohere into one unit.</p>
    <p>We then turned to the author-practitioner’s next step: “When it pleases
        you, bind and tighten it very well with a thread in two places, then cut
        the excess &amp; fit it in a quill of a convenient thickness for it, of
        a duck or a crow for the small ones.” We wrapped each bundle of wetted
        hair securely four to five times in thread, roughly ¼ inch from its
        base, i.e., the side that was closest to the tail bone on the squirrel
        (<i><u>Fig. 4</u></i>). We carefully kept the hairs from the sides of
        the tail separate from the hairs that had come from the end of the tail,
        as Cennini recommends to use the end hairs for the tip and the side
        hairs for the body. This provides the “architecture” of the brush, which
        was often supplemented with a rat’s whisker, crucial for executing fine
        details. Each of our brushes was assembled using seven to nine bundles
        of hair, depending on the size of the quill to be filled (<i><u>Fig.
                5</u></i>).</p>

    <p>We cut the quill from the goose feather and boiled it for ten minutes in
        water over a kitchen stove. When we removed it, the quill was much more
        pliable than it had been prior to boiling, although this only lasted for
        approximately a minute, after which point the quill had cooled. We used
        scissors to cut the boiled quill into a ferrule of ¾ inches, cutting two
        opposing slits into one end of each quill. This slit was not mentioned
        by any authors, but was necessitated by our first trial. We decided to
        slit the ferrule because it proved impossible to stuff all of the hairs
        into the quill without compromising their arrangement. With the slits
        cut into the quills, the ends became large enough to hold and maintain
        our arrangement of the hairs, and could be firmly fastened around the
        girth of the hair bundle with thread.</p>
    <p>Our greatest difficulty in inserting the hairs, once we had arranged the
        small bundles into the desired shape, was to ensure that the entire
        bundle made it into the quill intact. In order to keep the hairs from
        escaping the quill, we used a light coat of clear nail polish to keep
        the hairs in place for our second and third brush. While this was a
        departure from our sources, the problem itself was certainly familiar to
        those who made brushes: Gyles emphasizes the difficulty of inserting the
        hair into the quill in a manner that will not spoil the shape of the
        brush.<a href="#fn42"

    <p>Once the hairs were inserted into our slit ferrule (the quill), we
        wrapped the slit quills closed with thread (<i><u>Vid. 1</u></i>). It
        was not easy to keep the thread from sliding off the smooth quill, nor
        was the wrapping always effective (<i><u>Vid. 2</u></i>). While fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/66v/f/66v/tl"><u>66v</u></a>
        does not mention wrapping the quills, supplementary sources indicate
        that other practitioners found this process useful to secure the hair
        fibers in the quill. Piccolpasso’s illustration shows brushes that
        appear to be wrapped in thread.</p>

    <h2 id="why-is-this-recipe-in-ms.-fr.-640">Why is this recipe in Ms. Fr.
        640?</h2>
    <p>As our survey of the geography and primary source documentation of
        European brush making has demonstrated, it is difficult to draw
        conclusions about authorial intent in including brush-making
        instructions in painting treatises and technical manuals before the
        eighteenth century. Still, a textual analysis of the entry
        “Paintbrushes” (“<em>Pinceaulx</em>”) on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/66v/f/66v/tl"><u>66v</u></a>
        of Ms. Fr. 640 combined with reconstruction offers insights into the
        process of brush making. Significantly, the author-practitioner
        describes particular details of physical engagement with the materials,
        indicating that he intends for the reader to <em>actually perform</em>
        very specific actions in order to replicate his technique. The reader is
        enjoined to proceed by “pinching it [the bundle of hair] well with the
        thumb &amp; index finger,”—a technique that was crucial in our
        reconstruction and a piece of detailed information that is only
        important enough to be included if the author expects the reader to be
        performing the same activity. Furthermore, Cennini includes a “turning
        stick” in his description of brush-making, while the recipe in Ms. Fr.
        640 advises that the hairs be arranged in a folded card. Because the
        turning stick is a specialized tool used in the manufacture of brushes,
        and is thus a tool used by professional brush makers, the absence of the
        turning stick and the improvisational suggestion of the folded card may
        indicate that the author-practitioner’s recipe is intended for artists
        who are “making do” without ready-made brushes or specialized tools.</p>
    <p>Triangulating between the recipes in Cennini, Boltz von Ruffach, Gyles,
        and Ms. Fr. 640 allows us to suggest some tentative conclusions
        regarding the author-practitioner’s intended use for the recipe for
        brush making on fol. 66v. Gyles’ recipe is the most idiosyncratic of the
        three documents, recommending the use of a reed to arrange the hairs,
        thus contradicting Cennini on the desirability of using the end of the
        tail for the brush fibers. Could this be due to limited availability of
        materials in York? If so, then perhaps Gyles’s instructions for brush
        making are aimed at artisans who do not have ready access to London’s
        markets. Both Cennini and the author-practitioner of Ms. Fr. 640 refer
        to embodied practices, which seems to indicate that they both at least
        witnessed brush making and, as such, included their particular
        techniques as part of their instructions. We may also note the presence
        in Ms. Fr. 640 of “non-specialist” equipment. Rather than recommending a
        turning stick to arrange the fiber bundles, the author-practitioner
        mentions a folded card, indicating that the brushes are likely not being
        made professionally. When viewed as a whole, in conclusion, we propose
        that the detailed level of brush-making instruction on fol. 66v
        indicates that the author-practitioner of Ms. Fr. 640 had at least
        witnessed the process—and perhaps even tried it himself—before writing
        his recipe.</p>
