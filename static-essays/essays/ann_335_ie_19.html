        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <div>
            <p>This essay reflects on the process of marking up Ms. Fr. 640.
                While it is tempting to think of encoding as a straightforward
                process, this essay argues that encoding Ms. Fr. 640 was more
                than a matter of simply reading a text, identifying categories,
                and implementing tags. Rather, it was a complex and messy
                process which required close reading, continuous reflection and
                alteration, collective expertise, and collaboration between
                humanists and computers. This essay highlights the flexible,
                volatile, and non-finite nature of markup, and it illustrates
                that encoding was not a linear process, but rather was
                characterized by moving back and forth between pages, constantly
                implementing new and correcting old markup in an attempt to
                adhere to new decisions and safeguard consistency. Finally, it
                shows how solutions to markup problems were frequently sought by
                considering a user’s perspective. We conclude that encoding Ms.
                Fr. 640 not only required knowledge but also produced it.</p>

        <p><em>The Making and Knowing Project is a research and pedagogical
                initiative in the Center for Science and Society at Columbia
                University that explores the intersections between artistic

                as separate, yet in the earliest phases of the Scientific
                Revolution, nature was investigated primarily by skilled
                artisans by means of continuous and methodical experimentation
                in the making of objects – the time when “making” was
                “knowing.”</em></p>

    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>The authors of this article, two PhD
        students in the history of science, joined the Making and Knowing
        Project in the Summer of 2016 to participate in a Middle French
        Paleography Workshop held at Columbia University. Organized twice
        before, in the Summer of 2014 and 2015, this three-week workshop aimed
        to provide participants intensive training in the reading,
        transcription, translation, and XML encoding of Ms. Fr. 640. Not long
        after this workshop, the Making and Knowing team sent out an email
        requesting returning paleographers to indicate their preference for one
        of two tasks: translation or markup.<a href="#fn2"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref2"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> As native Dutch and French
        speakers with no professional translation experience, neither of us felt
        sufficiently equipped to translate an early modern manuscript into
        English, and we thus both leaned toward markup. Moreover, we believed
        the task of encoding would be more straightforward, manageable, and
        demand less expertise of two ambitious but relatively inexperienced
        graduate students than that of translating. We would soon come to
        revise—and at times even regret—that thought. Our choice for markup was
        the beginning of a long-term and intense collaboration, devoted entirely
        to the encoding of the manuscript—that is, tagging words, phrases, and
        features of the manuscript’s text with a custom set of XML tags. This
        essay is a reflection on that collaboration, or, more specifically, on
        the complex, messy, and non-finite, but historically instructive and
        intellectually rewarding process of marking up Ms. Fr. 640.<a

        some of the problems we encountered in it.</p>

        The Foundation and Conceptualization of Markup Categories for Ms. Fr.
        640</h2>
    <p>When we joined the project in 2016, neither of us had any experience with
        XML and TEI markup.<a href="#fn4"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref4"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> In fact, we had never even heard
        of it. Yet, while our markup journey only began in 2016, that of the
        project did not. Indeed, the foundations of the manuscript’s markup,
        upon which our encoding work would ultimately rely, had already been
        laid by the Making and Knowing team and former student paleographers
        working in 2014 and 2015.<a href="#fn5"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref5"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> It is therefore necessary to
        briefly discuss those early stages of markup development before we
        reflect on our own encoding work.</p>
    <h3 id="the-foundations-of-markup">The Foundations of Markup</h3>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>While the main aim of the Summer 2016
        workshop was to transcribe and translate the manuscript, one of its
        other goals was to “conceptualize and complete the markup.”
        “Conceptualize” here meant that we had to think about the “intellectual
        agenda” of the data that markup generates about the manuscript. In other
        words, what information about the text of Ms. Fr. 640 did we want markup
        to provide users of the Digital Critical Edition (DCE)? As we will show
        later, this required us to put ourselves in the shoes of potential users
        of the DCE and envision what specific information in Ms. Fr. 640 they
        might be interested in. In answering this question, a distinction was
        made between three types of information and its corresponding markup:
        structural, editorial, and semantic.</p>
    <p>The transcribed and translated Google documents that we began working
        with in 2016 were already partially encoded with structural, editorial,
        and semantic markup developed in 2014 and 2015—hence the task to
        “complete” the markup. Editorial markup indicates the intervention of
        the editors (i.e., the Making and Knowing team or paleographers) to the
        text of the manuscript. Abbreviations offer a good example. The
        author-practitioner frequently wrote words like <em>premierement</em> or
        <em>communement</em> in an abbreviated form, by spelling out
        “<em>premierem</em>” and “<em>communem</em>” and supplying the
        “<em>ent</em>” by means of a supralinear tilde (<i><u>Fig. 1</u></i>).
        When transcribing these words, Project paleographers typed curly
        brackets around the implied abbreviations: premierem{ent}. In cases
        where the author-practitioner forgot to add the tilde, we “supplied” the
        missing abbreviation using a “sup” tag:
        premierem&lt;sup&gt;{ent}&lt;/sup&gt;. Both the curly brackets and sup
        tag are forms of editorial markup.</p>

    <p>The difference between the structural and semantic markup can be
        explained with part of a 2014 translation of the entry <em>Pintiers</em>
        (Pewterers) on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/28v/f/28v/tl"><u>28v</u></a>:

        <p>&lt;ab id=”p028v_b1a”&gt;They think that the best <strong>pewter
            </strong> is in a great sow that has not been melted again since the
            mine, for <em>masters</em> melt it again on a grille weighing two or
            three pounds in order to cut it in bits and sell it by pieces. And
            they usually mingle it with some soldering pieces’ rests and
            ordinary <strong>pewter</strong>. And the best most shiny, as if
            polished for it is softer. Sometimes in their sows they find
            <strong>iron</strong>. Pieces, stones and similar things to dip in
            to some <strong>pitch</strong>. <strong><u>English</u> pewter
            </strong> is so hard that <em>minerons</em> add some <strong>lead
            </strong> to soften it. The one coming from <strong><u>German</u>
                coasts</strong> is softer. Usually the <em>
                <strong>pewter</strong> masters wardens
            </em> in <strong>good cities</strong> add six pounds of fine
            <strong>lead</strong> or eight sith a quintal of fine <strong>pewter
            </strong>. The <em>others who work in mines</em> add fifteen or 20
            or the more they can and to cover the <strong>lead</strong> black
            color and its softness, they add some <strong>ice pewter</strong> 4
            pounds with a quintal. &lt;/ab&gt;</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>Structural markup provides information
        about the layout, organization, or structural logic of a text on a
        page—for example, what part of a text constitutes a title, paragraph,
        subheader, etc.—and how single blocks of text on a page relate to each
        other. In the example above, structural divisions are made with the help
        of tags—that is, complementary snippets of machine-readable code
        inserted on either side of the text in question. Notice, for instance,
        how the word “Pewterers” on the first line is surrounded by information
        contained between angle brackets (&lt;title id=”p028v_a1”&gt; and
        &lt;/title&gt;), including the structural element “title.” This denotes
        that the text contained between the opening tag (&lt;title
        id=”p028v_a1”&gt;) and closing tag (&lt;/title&gt;) is a title, as
        opposed to, for example, a paragraph. Similarly, the text block that
        follows the title is nested inside “ab” tags (i.e., “anonymous block”),
        which describes the text between the opening and closing ab tags as an
        undefined, but coherent block of text, thereby distinguishing it from
        other structural elements on the page, such as the title.</p>
    <p>Structural markup differs from semantic markup in that the latter aims to
        provide information about the <em>meaning</em> of the text on a page.
        For instance, while the structural markup on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/28v/f/28v/tl"><u>28v</u></a>
        informs the reader that “Pewterers” is a title, that same encoding does
        not tell us anything about its semantics, i.e., what “pewterers”
        <em>signifies</em>. Semantic markup is needed to convey that
        information. In 2014, the Making and Knowing team and workshop
        participants had conceptualized three semantic markup
        categories—materials, place names, and professions—and marked up all
        occurrences of these categories in the manuscript. As the entry on
        Pewterers illustrates, unlike the structural markup, these categories
        were not denoted by tags. Rather, they were indicated with simple
        formatting: <strong>materials</strong> were set in boldface, <u>place
            names</u> were underlined, and <em>professions</em> italicized. A
        reader familiar with how each category was formatted, could understand,
        for instance, that “lead,” “iron,” and “pitch,” on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/28v/f/28v/tl"><u>28v</u></a>
        are materials. Although it was very easy for paleographers unfamiliar
        with XML markup to work with this type of formatting, it had obvious
        limitations. First, it only allowed for a limited number of categories
        (i.e., three), and therefore equally curbed the amount of semantic
        information that could be conveyed to users of the DCE. Second, it was
        very easy to accidentally remove the markup by formatting the text
        differently. So, in 2015, this method of encoding semantic elements was
        abandoned and replaced with the use of tags, matching the style of the
        structural markup. Similarly, the use of curly brackets to indicate
        abbreviations was substituted by “expansion” tags (e.g.,
        premierem&lt;exp&gt;ent&lt;/exp&gt;).</p>
    <p>Coming back to the goal of the 2016 workshop, when we were tasked to
        “conceptualize and complete the markup,” this meant: first, to remove
        remnants of the old formatting; and second, to further develop semantic
        categories and continue to implement the new XML markup. The remainder
        of this paper will focus on the latter task of conceptualizing and
        implementing markup. We will reflect on our efforts to encode Ms. Fr.
        640, identify some of the countless problems we encountered in the
        process, and highlight our key takeaways.</p>
    <h3 id="conceptualizing-semantic-markup-categories">Conceptualizing Semantic
        Markup Categories </h3>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>At the end of the 2016 workshop, we made a
        start on developing new semantic markup categories to extend beyond the
        three existing ones. Strictly speaking, our brainstorming sessions were
        geographically and intellectually situated, in that they took place
        within the walls of Columbia University in New York and as part of a
        discussion among participants in an academic workshop. However, in
        developing new semantic categories we pushed ourselves to think outside
        of those confines. Rather than conceptualizing what we, the Making and
        Knowing team and Text Workshop participants, wanted to learn about the
        manuscript, we framed this question in terms of “user stories.” That is,
        we asked ourselves, who would be interested in using the DCE, reading
        Ms. Fr. 640, and for what purposes? There were obviously infinite ways
        to answer these questions and account for all possible scenarios, yet
        some possibilities are illustrated in Table 1.<a href="#fn6"

    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>To take just one example, we imagined that
        historians of science interested in learning about quantitative thinking
        in the sixteenth century might want to know when the author-practitioner
        mentions units of measurement. Because it would be difficult, if not
        impossible, for scholars to think of all possible occurrences of such
        units and then use the DCE search function to look for those units, a
        tag to indicate units of measurement might be useful for those users.
    </p>
    <p>At the close of the Summer 2016 workshop, the Making and Knowing team
        crystallized these ideas into the twenty-one semantic markup categories,
        described in Table 2.<a href="#fn7"

    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>We can see, for example, that the user
        story of the historians of science interested in units of measurement
        has been translated into a “measurement” tag (&lt;ms&gt;), to be applied
        to words or phrases implying “measurement of any sort (temporal
        [including pater noster], volume, mass, length).” Similarly, to
        accommodate numismatists, we developed a coin and currency tag
        (&lt;cn&gt;).</p>
    <p>Not all suggestions or ideas made it to the list. For example, there was
        no “agricultural” tag for cultural historians interested in word- and
        phrase-level references to rural food production and land use, though
        “cultivation” and “animal husbandry” would become one of the twenty-six
        categories by which the Project classified the entries of the manuscript
        by thematic content.<a href="#fn8"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref8"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> Likewise, there was talk of a
        “fun tag,” to catch content like the method for training your dog
        described on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/131r/f/131r/tl"><u>131r</u></a>,
        and a “WOW!” tag. In the end, neither of these categories made it on the
        list, although we, the authors of this essay, are still in favor of
        implementing them. Even after having worked on this project for several
        years, the manuscript never ceases to amaze us and in many ways a WOW!
        tag seems an appropriate response to its marvelous content. Just as
        important as the final set and meaning of these tags was when and how to
        use them. As will be discussed below, this was by no means fixed or
        straightforward.</p>
    <p>The remaining question was how to implement these twenty-one categories
        or, in other words, how to mark up Ms. Fr. 640. In the next section, we
        will first lay out the principle steps of marking up the manuscript and
        will then reflect on our process.</p>
    <h2 id="encoding-ms.-fr.-640">Encoding Ms. Fr. 640</h2>
    <p>In the Summer of 2017, we convened daily for two weeks at the University
        Jean Jaurès in Toulouse with a group of eighteen people.<a href="#fn9"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref9"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> By this time, all participants
        were returning (i.e., experienced) paleographers, translators, and
        encoders who had attended at least one of the three previous workshops.
        Based on preferences and competencies, the group was split up into two
        teams with each working exclusively on translation or markup. The latter
        was made up of five individuals, divided over two groups: the first
        consisted of Making and Knowing postdoctoral scholars Donna Bilak and
        Tianna Uchacz and graduate student Celine Camps; the second included PhD
        student Sebestian Kroupa and graduate student Margot Lyautey. In
        contrast to 2016, when we progressed through Ms. Fr. 640 sequentially,
        folio by folio, from 2017 onward, work proceeded thematically. The
        manuscript’s entries had been divided up into categories (<i><u>Fig. 2</u></i>), for instance, alchemy, casting, dyeing, painting,
        metal, weapons, etc.<a href="#fn10"

    <p>The first step in encoding the manuscript was to decide which entries (or
        rather processes) to work on. This decision depended on the progress of
        the translation groups, as a folio would generally only be marked up
        once its translation had been finalized—i.e., signed off in the
        spreadsheet. Once an entry was ready for markup work, we would open the
        three corresponding transcription and translation documents in the
        Google Drive and go through the entire text from beginning to end to
        mark it up (<i><u>Fig. 4</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 5</u></i>).</p>

    </div>
    <p>Like many components of the Making and Knowing Project, our working
        method was highly collective. We soon realised that we worked best in
        groups of two and ideally three people. This was in part because we had
        to check and mark up three versions of the manuscript simultaneously—the
        diplomatic transcription (TC), the normalized transcription (TCN), and
        the translation (TL)—to guarantee uniformity and consistency. While it
        was theoretically possible for one person to mark up all three versions,
        toggling between multiple documents was extremely strenuous and
        demanding on a single person’s eyes and mind, not to mention time
        consuming and inefficient, something we found out firsthand over a few
        days in the Summer 2018 Text Workshop.<a href="#fn12"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref12"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> Therefore, each person would
        ideally only check and encode one document. When a group consisted of
        only two people, one person would work on the two French versions (TC
        and TCN) while the other looked at the English translation (TL).</p>
    <p>In encoding the text and verifying and unifying existing markup, we
        mirrored the working method of the translation team: one person would
        read the text from the English translation out loud—also uttering the
        tags—and once a letter, word, sentence, or textblock had to be encoded
        or its markup corrected, we paused and conferred with each other. We
        then inserted and corrected the relevant tags. When we had completed the
        markup of an entry, we would double check our work, put our initials and
        the date in the spreadsheet, and move on to the next entry (always
        checking the progress of the translation team first).</p>
    <p>Now that we have discussed the principle steps of the encoding process,
        the next sections will reflect in more detail on the nature of markup
        and the problems we encountered and tried to overcome in the process,
        drawing on examples and experiences across the various years.</p>
    <h2 id="reflections-on-encoding-ms.-fr.-640">Reflections on Encoding Ms. Fr.
        640</h2>
    <p>As mentioned in the introduction to this essay, when we indicated our
        preference to concentrate on markup for the 2017 Text Workshop, we
        believed encoding the manuscript would be a fairly straightforward,
        unproblematic, and manageable process that would not demand much
        expertise. After all, a full tag set had been finalized in 2016, and it
        seemed a simple matter of implementing those tags. Nothing proved
        further from the truth. Encoding Ms. Fr. 640 was not a matter of simply
        reading the text, identifying categories, and implementing tags. Rather,
        as the following sections show, it was a highly complex and messy
        process which required close reading, continuous reflection and
        alteration, and collective expertise on a wide variety of subjects.</p>
    <h3 id="close-reading-and-collective-expertise">Close Reading and Collective
        Expertise</h3>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>Fundamentally, markup takes the way that
        humanists read and interpret a text and makes it “readable” to a
        computer. So, a humanist marking up a text first needs to understand it.
        Take for example the sentence, “The surgeon reached for a scalpel.” If
        we were to mark this up according to our list of semantic categories,
        the encoded sentence would look like this: “The
        &lt;pro&gt;surgeon&lt;/pro&gt; reached for a
        &lt;tl&gt;scalpel&lt;/tl&gt;.” Notice how “surgeon” is nested in “pro”
        tags (“profession”) and “scalpel” in “tl” tags (“tool”). For anyone who
        does not know that “surgeon” is a profession or “scalpel” denotes a
        tool, it would be impossible to encode these words accordingly. In other
        words, encoding the manuscript was not just a mechanical but also an
        intellectual act. It required close reading and a level of knowledge
        about and understanding of a wide range of subjects that we neither
        possessed nor could have foreseen needing when we joined the Project.
        Most importantly, our ability to understand and mark up the text of Ms.
        Fr. 640 significantly depended on a collective of people and sources
        well beyond the manuscript or the Making and Knowing team itself.</p>
    <p>Part of the difficulty in encoding the manuscript lay in the fact that
        many terms and processes described by the author-practitioner have
        become obscured over time and by modern historical terminology. For
        example, <em>or mat</em> on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/66r/f/66r/tl"><u>66r</u></a>
        means “mordant gilding” in modern English, but this translation obscures
        the sense of the sixteenth-century term. Anachronistic translations and
        interpretations might have problematic consequences for markup. While a
        term may be classified as a material from a modern perspective, it may
        not have been in the sixteenth century. For instance, “coral” (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/3r/f/3r/tl"><u>3r</u></a>)
        is nowadays understood as an animal, but was it also classified as such
        in the sixteenth century? We aimed, both in translation and markup, to
        bring the historical meaning of terms and processes (or actors’
        categories) back into view by avoiding (as much as possible) to impose a
        modern understanding of categories (such as materials) onto the
        manuscript, except where those historical meanings might engender
        confusion in modern readers.<a href="#fn13"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref13"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> This was easier said than done.
        While some entries were fairly straightforward, others were hard to
        understand, even for native French speakers or seasoned historians. More
        specifically, it was often difficult to grasp the meaning of terms or
        processes described by the author-practitioner. Our ignorance thus made
        it equally difficult to know if and how words should be tagged. For
        instance, we had to understand what <em>azur d’esmail</em> (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/11r/f/11r/tl"><u>11r</u></a>)
        meant in order to determine if it should be marked up as a material or
        not.<a href="#fn14"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref14"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
    <p>In some cases the manuscript itself provided more insight: while the
        meaning of a word was sometimes unclear in one entry, it was clarified
        or intelligible in another. For instance, the terms <em>paillette</em>
        (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/134v/f/134v/tl"><u>134v</u></a>)
        and <em>or de paillelle</em> (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/149r/f/149r/tl"><u>149r</u></a>)
        were translated as “spangle” and “spangle gold” respectively, due to the
        explanation on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/104v/f/104v/tl"><u>104v</u></a>
        that <em>pailleterie</em> (spangling work) is the application of “scales
        of pure silver &amp; of gilt silver.” As a result, only <em>or de
            paillelle</em> was marked up as a material, since <em>paillette</em>
        could apply to either silver or gold and seemed to denote, in this
        instance, more of a “format” for a material than a material proper.
        Reading multiple entries alongside each other could thus help unravel
        the meaning of certain terms and determine their appropriate markup. In
        other cases, we had to consult early modern dictionaries and reference
        works, use the glossary that was being developed and refined by the
        translation teams, gloss entries and terms with relevant academic
        literature, or mine other contemporaneous technical writings (e.g., Hugh
        Plat’s <em>The Jewell House of Art and Nature</em> from 1594) to make
        sense of a term or process.<a href="#fn15"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref15"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
    <p>In addition to written sources, we frequently consulted other people,
        including the translation teams, who had often already been able to
        demystify a process or concept through their translation work. Certain
        entries, however, were so esoteric that we needed the help of
        specialists. A case in point are the recipes pertaining to weapons,
        which contained numerous technical terms and processes with which none
        of us were familiar. In the Summer of 2018, Jonathan Tavares and Pascal
        Brioist—two experts on arms and armor—joined our workshop. To help us
        all make sense of the chapter on the “Furbisher” (fols. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/94r/f/94r/tl"><u>94r</u></a>
        to <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/96r/f/96r/tl"><u>96r</u></a>)
        or the entry on “Grey guards” (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/96r/f/96r/tl"><u>96r</u></a>)
        Tavares and Brioist drew out and named the individual parts of a sword
        and harness (<i><u>Fig. 6</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 7</u></i>). Through these
        drawings, we were able to understand the author-practitioner’s
        vocabulary and determine if a word should be marked up as a tool,
        material, or not at all. Similarly, Making and Knowing postdoctoral
        scholar Sophie Pitman, an expert on early modern dress and material
        culture, helped us distinguish when <em>cotton</em> denoted a plant or a
        specific type of cloth. Additionally, by consulting experts outside of
        the Making and Knowing team, we were able to determine that <em>azur
            d’esmail</em> may mean “smalt” (blue glass that was ground and used
        as a colorant in pigments) or azurite.<a href="#fn16"

    <h3 id="to-tag-or-not-to-tag">To Tag or Not to Tag</h3>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>In the previous section we illustrated how
        our ignorance of certain words and processes problematized the process
        of implementing markup. Yet even as we accumulated knowledge, the act of
        encoding did not necessarily become less complicated. For, as we worked
        our way through the manuscript, new markup problems arose. On numerous
        occasions, it was not the meaning of a word or process but rather the
        meaning of a markup category—i.e., its boundaries, possibilities, and
        limits—and how best to implement it became the subject of debate. This
        section will highlight the flexible, volatile, and non-finite nature of
        markup and its categories. In doing so, it will show that encoding the
        manuscript was not a linear process in which we moved in a straight line
        from fol. 1r to 170v. Rather it was characterized by moving back and
        forth between pages, constantly implementing new and correcting old
        markup in an attempt to adhere to new decisions and safeguard
        consistency. In other words, we will discuss some of the problems we
        encountered in working with markup categories and illustrate how
        solutions to them were frequently sought by approaching issues from a
        user’s perspective.</p>
    <p>While understanding the meaning of a term certainly helped us to know how
        it could be marked up, this was not always sufficient. Even when we
        understood a term, and knew it could be marked up, the question
        frequently was: should it be? Materials, for example, often occurred
        with such frequency or their meaning was so vague that we decided to
        only mark them up in very specific cases: <em>eau</em> (water), for
        instance, would only be encoded as a material when qualified (e.g.,
        <em>eau de pluie</em> (rain water)) or when used comparatively (e.g.,
        “liquid like water”). Fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/50r/f/50r/tl"><u>50r</u></a>
        offers another good example: take the following clause: “If you want to
        promptly mold something in half relief that comes to hand, [...].”<a
           href="#fn17"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref17"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> The word “hand” denotes a body
        part and, strictly speaking, could be marked up. However, because it is
        only used metaphorically and the phrase “that comes to hand” does not
        mean the actual use of one's hands, we chose not to tag it.</p>
    <p>On other occasions, the reverse was the case. Though some words did not
        strictly fall under one of our markup categories, we believed they
        deserved to be marked up nevertheless. For example, although words like
        <em>halene</em> (breath), <em>salive</em> (saliva), and <em>urine</em>
        (urine) do not denote body parts, they do imply parts (or rather,
        fluids) of the body being used in making processes. We therefore decided
        that these words had to be marked up as body parts too. Similarly, when
        a material was implied in a word for a process, technique, or tool, the
        word was to be encoded as well: e.g., <em>pot plombé</em> (leaded pot)
        or <em>huiler</em> (oiling).</p>
    <p>These examples also point to another question commonly raised in our
        encoding work: what is the scope of a tag, or how much do we mark up?
        This question was especially pertinent in the case of materials. For on
        numerous occasions the author-practitioner further defines and
        distinguishes between materials by adding a qualifier. On fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/94v/f/94v/tl"><u>94v</u></a>,
        for instance, he explains that the gold grips of sword guards are made
        with “thin yellow canvas or a different canvas yellowed with chalk.”<a
           href="#fn18"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref18"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> While it would have been correct
        (and most easy) to mark up “canvas” (in both instances) and “chalk” as
        materials and proceed to the next sentence; the instructions do not call
        for just <em>any</em> canvas, but rather for “thin yellow canvas”
        <em>or</em> “canvas yellowed with chalk.” In other words, the
        author-practitioner has added qualifiers (“thin yellow”; and “yellowed
        with chalk”) to distinguish between various types of canvas. The
        question therefore was: should we expand the scope of the material tag
        to include qualifiers too? Because we considered it important to capture
        the distinctions made by the author-practitioner between various types
        of (the same) materials, we chose to mark up qualifiers as well. In
        accord with that decision, the TL markup of the example on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/94v/f/94v/tl"><u>94v</u></a>
        resulted in: &lt;m&gt;thin yellow canvas&lt;/m&gt; or a different
        &lt;m&gt;canvas yellowed with chalk&lt;/m&gt;.</p>
    <p>Though, as was the case with canvas, marking up qualifiers often only
        required us to add a few words more, the example of <em>tuiles</em>
        (“tiles”) on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/106v/f/106v/tl"><u>106v</u></a>
        illustrates that our decision to expand the scope of a tag meant that it
        would sometimes span several lines. Take for instance the entry
        <em>tuiles</em> (“tiles”) on fol. 106v, which opens with the remark
        that: “Tiles with which one covers houses, the hardest &amp; firmest,
        and purged of stones &amp; coarse gravel, are used to mix in with the
        sand for molding.”<a href="#fn19"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref19"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a> Following our rule to mark up
        qualifiers, the material tag for this particular sentence starts with
        “tiles” (the qualified word) and runs all the way to “coarse gravel,”
        one line down, where the qualifier ends and the material tag closes:
        “&lt;m&gt;Tiles with which one covers houses, the hardest &amp; firmest,
        and purged of stones &amp; coarse gravel&lt;/m&gt;, are used to mix in
        with the sand for molding.”</p>
    <p>Examples like that of canvas or tiles were easy to encode given that the
        qualifier immediately preceded or succeeded the qualified word. But what
        do you do when a qualifier and the term to be qualified are separated by
        a long string of words, or, worse, when they are not even part of the
        same text block on a page? Directing our attention to another part of
        the entry <em>tuiles</em> on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/106v/f/106v/tl"><u>106v</u></a>
        can help illustrate the problem here. In a marginal note, written on the
        right-hand side of the entry’s title, the author-practitioner remarks
        that: “Those of the houses that are not sandy seem to withstand fire
        better.”<a href="#fn20"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref20"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> Notice that the
        author-practitioner here is qualifying a different type of tile: not
        “tiles with which one covers houses, the hardest &amp; firmest, and
        purged of stones &amp; coarse gravel”—described in the text block
        immediately below the entry title (and used in the previous example)—but
        rather tiles “of the houses that are not sandy.” Note especially,
        however, that the qualified word “tiles” has been substituted by the
        demonstrative pronoun “those”, thereby referring the reader back to the
        title of the entry (<em>tuiles</em>) and its accompanying textblock. In
        other words, the qualified word (tiles) and the qualifier (“of the
        houses that are not sandy seem to withstand fire better”) are not just
        separated from each other by a string of words. Rather, they are not
        even part of the same text block (the former being the title, the latter
        having been nested in a marginal note). So what should the scope of the
        material tag be here? Do you only mark up the qualified word (“tile”) or
        its substitute (“those”); only the qualifier (“of the houses that are
        not sandy.”); both the qualifier and the qualified word, or nothing at
        all? After much debate, we reasoned that because the word “tiles” had
        already been marked up as a material at least once before in this entry
        (namely in the title), fol. 106v would definitely come up when filtering
        the manuscript for occurances of tiles and any reader interested in this
        material would probably read the entire entry either way—thus equally
        noticing the marginal note. We therefore decided not to mark up the
        marginal note with an m-tag (except for the “material” not sandy).</p>
    <p>As this example shows, questions of scope were not always easy to answer.
        They often had to be dealt with on a case-by-case basis and required
        lengthy group discussions (<i><u>Fig. 8</u></i>). To expedite the markup
        process and make it more efficient, we capped our discussion time at
        five minutes. If a markup issue could not be solved within that time,
        either because we could not reach an immediate agreement or the problem
        was too complex, we would make a note of it and move on.</p>

    <p>Because the boundaries of markup categories were constantly in flux,
        rules had numerous exceptions to them, and new decisions were made on a
        daily basis, it was difficult to remember all markup rules. This was
        especially true from workshop to workshop: since we typically met for
        only two weeks each summer, by the time we reconvened, the decisions of
        previous years had almost been forgotten. An encoding protocol was
        therefore kept in the Project’s Google Drive that recorded all markup
        rules and decisions (<i><u>Fig. 9</u></i>).<a href="#fn21"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref21"

        “to tag or not to tag” table with a list of commonly encountered
        problems and current solutions in categories like materials, places, and
        body parts (<i><u>Fig. 10</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 11</u></i>). Moreover,
        when new decisions were made during one of the workshops, these were
        also written on a whiteboard in our workspace, which was visible to all
        groups and prevented us from having to toggle between multiple documents
        while working (<i><u>Fig. 12</u></i>).</p>

    <p>Finally, in many instances the question was not only should a term be
        tagged, but also, if yes, how best to do so. This latter question was
        mainly raised due to first, the difference in language between the
        transcriptions and the translation, and second, our aim to ensure a
        consistent, useful, and unified markup across all three versions (i.e.,
        TC, TCN, TL). The remaining examples in this section will show that
        answers to these questions were frequently sought by approaching
        problems from a user’s perspective.</p>
    <p>In terms of encoding, the 2017 Summer Text Workshop was devoted to
        completing the markup of all versions of the manuscript. By that time,
        the markup was the product of three previous workshops (held in 2014,
        2015, and 2016), in which different people had worked on the entries of
        the manuscript with continuously changing markup procedures. The
        resulting markup was therefore in various stages and inconsistent. The
        aim from 2017 onward was to update the encoding and to ensure a
        consistent and unified markup of the manuscript. In other words, we
        strove to keep the structural, editorial, and semantic markup the same
        across all three versions. This was not always possible and in certain
        cases concessions had to be made.</p>
    <p>The difference in language between the TC (and TCN) and the TL made it
        difficult to carry over all the markup from one version to the other.
        Take for instance expansions. We have already explained that we used
        expansion tags to indicate expanded abbreviations (e.g., in
        <em>premierement</em> or <em>communement</em>) in the TC and TCN. Markup
        protocol required us to maintain a consistent markup. Yet how do you
        carry over an expansion to the translation when the difference in
        language does not allow you to indicate in English which part of the
        source word is abbreviated? Specifically, how do you communicate to the
        English reader that the “<em>ent</em>” in <em>premierement</em> is
        abbreviated when they encounter Ms. Fr. 640 through the TL, whether
        first or exclusively? In such cases, we chose to deviate from our rule
        of consistency—expansion tags are not represented in the TL.</p>
    <p>Deletions offer another good example. Protocol stipulated that deletions
        were to be maintained across all three versions. In many cases this
        could be done with ease. For instance, on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/4v/f/4v/tl"><u>4v</u></a>
        the author-practitioner first wrote <em>oignons</em>, but then corrected
        himself and crossed it out. All it took to carry over the deletion to
        the TL was to translate the word <em>oignons</em> to “onions” and nest
        the latter in deletion tags: &lt;del&gt;onions&lt;/del&gt;. Yet in other
        instances, adhering to consistency demanded creativity because of the
        nature of the deletion. Especially problematic were cases where only a
        string of letters, which could not be translated, were deleted. A case
        in point is a deletion on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/36v/f/36v/tl"><u>36v</u></a>.
        In the first entry on this page, the author-practitioner originally
        wrote: “Il est vray que pour les rendre plus vendables les
        <em>fondables</em> y meslent plus de letton.”<a href="#fn22"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref22"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a> He then realized he had made a
        mistake and crossed out “<em>ables</em>” in <em>fondables</em> and
        replaced it with (i.e., added) “eurs,” thus changing <em>fondables</em>
        to <em>fondeurs</em> (<i><u>Fig. 13</u></i>). Our markup in the TC and
        TCN attempted to render the author-practitioner’s partial deletion and
        addition as well as the fact that the word <em>fondeurs</em> indicates a
        profession (<i><u>Fig. 14</u></i>). In accord with our markup protocol
        and aim to unify the three versions, all deletions had to be carried
        over from the TC to the TCN and the TL. However, the word “founders,”
        the English translation of <em>fondeurs</em>, does not include an
        “ables,” and the latter string of letters cannot be translated into
        English either. So the question was, how do we include a deletion tag
        here? The answer came from our asking what would be most beneficial to
        potential users of the DCE. We reasoned that a great number of users
        (perhaps especially those without French skills) might not read the
        translation alongside the transcription and, as a result, would be
        unaware of the deletion if not marked up in the TL. We therefore found
        it important to flag in the TL that the author-practitioner had
        corrected himself in the source text—in case users might be interested
        in this information. Concretely, our solution was to carry over the
        corrected letters, words, or strings of them, to the TL and, in cases
        where they could not be translated, nest them in “fr” (French) tags to
        indicate the difference in language (<i><u>Fig. 15</u></i>).</p>

    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>Usability rather than consistency also
        became the goal in marking up fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/16r/f/16r/tl"><u>16r</u></a>.
        In the entry “Founding of soft iron,” the author-practitioner explains
        that miners use <em>deulx ou trois poignees</em> (two or three handfuls)
        of wallwort “to make the iron run.” The English “handfuls” denotes a
        body part—the hand—and, following our markup protocol, should thus be
        marked up with a &lt;bp&gt; tag. Yet, the implied use of the hand is
        less obvious in the French <em>poignees</em> and tagging it as a body
        part could be considered illogical and potentially confusing to the
        reader. Should it therefore be tagged in the TC and TCN at all? While it
        would have been logical to omit the tag in the French, marking up only
        the English would lead to an inconsistency in tags. Yet, more important
        to our decision than a unified markup, were the implications our
        encoding practices might have for potential users of the DCE. Unless
        marked up, the entry “Founding of soft iron” on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/16r/f/16r/tl"><u>16r</u></a>
        would not appear when filtering the transcription for mention of body
        parts, and users might not think of searching for the word
        <em>poignees</em> themselves. It was these assumptions about potential
        users and usability that ultimately made us decide to mark up
        <em>poignees</em> as a body part in the TC and TCN as well.</p>
    <p>In sum, even though we had already developed our markup categories, their
        rules and the practice of implementation were not straightforward, their
        conceptual boundaries never fixed but rather constantly tested and
        redefined as we moved through and gained knowledge of the manuscript.
        Moreover, it was precisely because of the ever-changing, flexible, and
        non-finite nature of our markup categories that we constantly had to
        move back and forth between pages, either correcting existing or
        inserting new markup on previously completed folios, in accordance with
        the latest encoding protocols. In the next and final section, we will
        show that although we have focused primarily on the role of the human
        intellect in this paper, encoding always depended on a collaboration
        between humans and computers.</p>
    <h3 id="encoding-a-collaboration-between-humanists-and-computers">Encoding:
        A Collaboration Between Humanists and Computers </h3>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>Although marking up Ms. Fr. 640 was
        primarily a human endeavor, computers and digital tools were
        nevertheless essential to our work. For instance, we already saw how the
        digital tracking spreadsheet made by Naomi Rosenkranz and the markup
        protocols made our efforts more efficient. Besides the fact that our
        markup work was done in the Google Drive, computers and digital tools
        also played a role in a different way.</p>
    <p>Our markup ultimately had to be read by a computer, and any failure or
        error on our part when inserting tags would problematize this process. A
        commonly made mistake, for example, was to forget to close a tag. Let us
        explain this briefly: in order for a computer to read our markup
        language, each semantic category requires a tag that opens with the form
        &lt;element name&gt; and closes with the form &lt;/element name&gt;
        (note the forward slash here). For instance, when we want a computer to
        interpret the word “fish” in the entry “Fish glue or isinglass (and
        mouth glue)” (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/7r/f/7r/tl"><u>7r</u></a>)
        as an animal, it requires an opening &lt;al&gt; tag and a closing
        &lt;/al&gt; tag. The proper markup would result in:
        &lt;al&gt;fish&lt;/al&gt;. Yet the forward slash is easily forgotten (or
        confused with a backward slash) when inserting tags manually, thereby
        hampering a computer’s ability to understand the markup. Another
        frequent error was to confuse the order of multiple tags and create an
        asymmetry. For example, the word “fish glue” denotes both a material and
        an animal and has to be marked up as follows:
        &lt;m&gt;&lt;al&gt;Fish&lt;/al&gt; glue&lt;/m&gt;. Note the order of the
        tags: the word “fish” is nested inside an opening and closing “al” tag,
        thus encoding it as an animal; the term “fish glue” is surrounded by
        opening and closing “m” tags, thus indicating it as a material. It looks
        straightforward, but mistakes are easily made. Compare, for instance,
        the order of the tags in the previous example with that in the
        following: &lt;al&gt;&lt;m&gt;Fish&lt;/al&gt; glue&lt;/m&gt;. The
        elements are the same, but their order has changed significantly. The
        “m” tag (&lt;m&gt;) opens inside another element (the “al” tag), but it
        does not close before the outer element (i.e., &lt;al&gt;) does. In
        other words, these two tag sets overlap rather than nest. Nesting tags
        are permitted; overlapping are not. As a result, the markup in this
        latter example will cause errors when the computer tries to read it.</p>
    <p>Though these mistakes are not hard to spot in isolated examples, they can
        be easily overlooked in a text as heavily marked up as that of the entry
        “For gilding with gold color and tinsel” on fol. <a
           href="https://edition-staging.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/7r/f/7r/tl"><u>7r</u></a>
        (<i><u>Fig. 16</u></i>). To reduce the risk of such errors and
        facilitate and expedite the process of encoding and identifying
        mistakes, Philip Cherian, an MSc student in physics and philosophy of
        science at the École Polytechnique and returning participant in the Text
        Workshops, developed two ingenious Google Docs add-ons (which he
        eventually consolidated into a single multipurpose tool), for the markup
        team: one for inserting tags (<i><u>Vid. 1</u></i>), and another for
        validating encoded documents (<i><u>Vid. 2</u></i>, <i><u>Vid. 3</u></i>). Video 1 illustrates how the first add-on enabled us to mechanically
        insert tags without having to type them out ourselves, reducing the risk
        of forgetting, for instance, a forward slash in the closing tag or of
        inserting the wrong element. Videos 2 and 3 show how we could validate
        our encoded documents—i.e., check for errors—by using the second add-on.
        This tool would not only notify us of mistakes (e.g., an imbalance in
        tags) and inform us about the type of error made (e.g., missing end
        tag), but also help us locate it on the page (e.g., on line nine).
        Notice also how this tool changes the format and color of the markup,
        making it easier to distinguish from the manuscript’s text.</p>

    <p>Since markup mistakes would make the text impossible for a computer to
        process, validating our work was no mere formality, and we developed
        strategies to remind and incentivize ourselves to get the encoding
        right. If the markup team should ever have a mascot, it would have to be
        dancing Kermit, his hands flailing about upon seeing an error-free
        markup (<i><u>Vid. 4</u></i>). In fact, validating was so important that
        it not only became the group’s watchword—with both markup and
        translation teams being reminded in many ways to check their work before
        proceeding to the next entry or folio—but even became a song, aimed to
        keep the spirits high (<i><u>Fig. 17</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 18</u></i>).
        Indeed, encoding Ms. Fr. 640 was a very demanding task, and by 2017 we
        got so immersed in it that, upon leaving the Text Workshop at the end of
        the day, we started mentally marking up the produce we encountered as we
        walked through the supermarkets of Toulouse, planning our dinners.</p>

    <p>In sum, though largely a human affair, marking up Ms. Fr. 640 could not
        have been done without the help of computers and digital tools.</p>
    <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>When we joined the Project in the summer of 2016 and indicated our
        preference for markup, we assumed the task of encoding Ms. Fr. 640 would
        be straightforward, manageable, and require minimal knowledge and
        expertise. This essay has demonstrated the opposite. Although much is
        left unsaid and this paper cannot do full justice to our work or that of
        others on whom we depended, we hope to have identified some of the most
        important characteristics and problems of encoding Ms. Fr. 640.</p>
    <p>We have shown that marking up Ms. Fr. 640 was a complex and messy
        endeavor, which required close reading, continuous reflection and
        alteration, and collective expertise on a wide variety of subjects. We
        have equally highlighted the non-finite nature of markup. Indeed even
        now, as the Project has met its first major objective with the
        publication of <em>Secrets of Craft and Nature in Renaissance France. A
            Digital Critical Edition and English Translation of BnF Ms. Fr.
            640</em>, and the markup of the manuscript is, in that sense,
        complete, the encoding can still be considered unfinished. There are
        always more tags to add or remove; conceptual boundaries to redefine,
        and new categories to be developed. In that way, markup truly is a
        never-ending process.</p>
    <p>Above all, we hope to have shown that—contrary to what we initially
        believed—it took knowledge to mark up Ms. Fr. 640. Knowledge of the
        manuscript and its structure. Knowledge of the historical terms and
        processes contained within it and of the sources and experts who could
        help us obtain it. Knowledge of how computers and humanists read a text.
        And knowledge of how our work could benefit users. Most importantly,
        encoding Ms. Fr. 640 not only required knowledge, but through the very
        process of obtaining that knowledge, also produced it. In a sense, the
        resulting markup can be considered a mirror of the Project’s collective
        knowledge—both its acquisition and production. In other words—in the
        spirit of the Project and its mission as conveyed in this essay’s
        epigraph—ma&lt;r&gt;king was knowing.</p>

                    written without this protocol, as it enabled us to
                    retroactively reconstruct our reasoning and decision making

                <p>While <em>porte</em> can be translated as “door” and
                    <em>morte</em> as “dead,” it would hide the fact that
                    <em>porte</em> (the original word) and <em>morte</em> (the
                    correction) sound alike. This rhyme may indicate something
                    of the author-practitioner’s habits of mind when writing and
                    could be interesting for users of the DCE. The rhyme could
                    also indicate he was taking dictation and misheard, as seems
                    to be the case with some entries in Ms. Fr. 640 written by
                    the scribe known as “Hand D.” See Smith, “Making Ms. Fr.
