                includes text and image instructions to make a “buckram
                sausage,” a sausage-shaped fabric tube filled with gunpowder
                used as a fuse for short-range artillery. While Ms. Fr. 640
                contains more than twenty entries related to gunpowder
                technology, the buckram sausage passages are among the very few
                instances of highly specific textual and visual instructions on
                the materials, techniques, and procedures of weapon production.
                Using hands-on reconstruction and research into the artisanal
                production of weapons in early modern Europe, this essay also
                explores the possible uses of the buckram sausage on the
                battlefield and examines how the author-practitioner engages
                with contemporaneous military technology in his writing.
                Finally, this essay calls attention to the importance of wartime
                contingencies and commonplace techniques in understanding the
                translation between practical and textual knowledge with regard
                to early modern military technology.</p>

    <p><em>At the time this essay was written (spring 2016), the preliminary
            Making and Knowing English translation of Ms. Fr. 640 translated the
            French</em> mortier <em>as the weapon “mortar.” In 2018, in
            consultation with collaborators Pascal Brioist and Jonathan Tavares,
            the Project recognized that although the author-practitioner used
            the French term</em> mortier<em>,</em> <em>he was in fact describing
            a gunpowder weapon novel at his time—the “petard.” Related in form
            to a mortar, a petard was typically affixed to walls and doors for
            the purpose of breaching. Petards are thought to have been used for
            the first time at the siege of Cahors in 1580, and were quite widely
            used from 1588 onward during the wars of religion.</em><a

            to either weapon.</em></p>

        <em>mortier</em>. This French term is typically translated into English
        as “mortar,” meaning a short-barreled gun that fires projectiles at
        short ranges and high angles. Mortars were commonly used in siege
        warfare in Europe from the late fifteenth century onward, developed and
        first used by the Ottomans in the 1453 siege of Constantinople,<a

        be attached directly to a <em>mortier</em>, slightly later sources show
        that such gunpowder-filled tubes could have additional functions. An
        illustration in the 1630 <em>La pyrotechnie</em> of Jean Appier-Hanzelet
        (1596–1647) shows that larger <em>saulcisses</em> (sausages) could be
        used against the gunports of fortresses, with one end fed directly into
        the aperture of the gunport and the other lit from further off (<i><u>Fig. 1</u></i>).<a href="#fn4"

    <p>The buckram sausage recipe in Ms. Fr. 640 is notable among the
        manuscript’s weapon entries for at least two reasons. First, the
        author-practitioner describes at length the materials and technical
        procedures involved in the making of the sausage, supplementing the
        recipe with a drawing that shows not only how the final product should
        look but also how it will function in connection with the mortar. While
        there are a number of ambiguities regarding the materials used and the
        purpose of constructing such a sausage, the combination of the
        author-practitioner’s step-by-step instructions and visual references
        makes the buckram sausage recipe one of the very few weapon-making
        recipes in Ms. Fr. 640 that is feasible for reconstruction. Second,
        while many of the artillery recipes in the manuscript concern
        larger-scale metal casting and foundry practices, such as the casting of
        barrels and cannon balls, the buckram sausage recipe exemplifies the
        author-practitioner’s interest in accessible and commonplace materials
        and techniques. In fact, the term “sausage” has a strong domestic
        connotation; at first glance, one might not associate it with any kind
        of military device or technology at all.</p>
    <p>In my analysis and reconstruction of the buckram sausage as detailed on
        fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/23r/f/23r/tl"><u>23r</u></a>–<a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/23v/f/23v/tl"><u>23v</u></a>,
        I examine how the author-practitioner mediates the textual description
        and the material processes of weapon-making through visual illustration.
        Using research on the historical artisanal production of weapons in
        early modern Europe together with hands-on reconstruction, I will
        explore the possible uses of the buckram sausage on the battlefield and
        examine how the author-practitioner engages with contemporary military
        technology in his writing. Addressing these issues helps illuminate the
        extent to which the author-practitioner may have had personal experience
        in warfare and hands-on weapon production, and the relationship between
        domestic artisanal techniques and weapon-making practices in early
        modern Europe.</p>
    <h2 id="the-buckram-sausage-text-and-image">The Buckram Sausage: Text and
        Image</h2>
    <p>In Ms. Fr. 640, there are two main clusters of entries for gunpowder
        weapons. The first cluster can be found under the heading, “On the
        gunner” on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/17r/f/17r/tl"><u>17r</u></a>,
        which covers a wide range of weapons including culverins,
        <em>bastard</em> culverins, passe-volant, falconet, arquebuses, and
        muskets. This cluster mainly focuses on the weight and dimensions of
        weapons, occasionally offering practical information about the strategic
        use of different artillery pieces in different kinds of battles.
        Although the materials and composition of metal alloys used to cast
        artillery are mentioned at times, this cluster of recipes resembles a
        catalogue of weapons without much detail about the casting techniques
        and actual procedures of artillery production. The second cluster spans
        fols. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/21r/f/21r/tl"><u>21r</u></a>
        to <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/28r/f/28r/tl"><u>28r</u></a>.
        These pages contain strategic advice on the use of artillery pieces,
        giving directions for shooting cannons at night (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/21r/f/21r/tl"><u>21r</u></a>–<a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/21v/f/21v/tl"><u>21v</u></a>)
        and the defense of a town (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/21v/f/21v/tl"><u>21v</u></a>).
        However, in contrast to the weapons discussed from fols. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/17r/f/17r/tl"><u>17r</u></a>
        to <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/19r/f/19r/tl"><u>19r</u></a>,
        this second group of recipes provides more concrete information on the
        actual production processes of making gunpowder weapons. For example,
        the recipe for grenades (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/24r/f/24r/tl"><u>24r</u></a>)
        and the recipe for a mortar (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/26r/f/26r/tl"><u>26r</u></a>)
        both give highly specific instructions about the materials, techniques,
        and procedures of weapon making.</p>
    <p>While the buckram sausage recipe on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/23r/f/23r/tl"><u>23r</u></a>–<a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/23v/f/23v/tl"><u>23v</u></a>
        is part of the larger recipe for making a mortar, it is almost as long
        as the mortar section itself. The author-practitioner makes it clear at
        the beginning of this recipe that the main body of the buckram sausage
        should be “sewn in such a way that it is like a gut through which a
        stick as thick as a finger can pass;” further, it stresses how the main
        body of the sausage should be submersed “lightly” in a mixture of
        vinegar and spirits after being filled with gunpowder. Then, one has to
        sew “a long string or cord” onto the main body of the sausage before
        smearing the whole sausage with turpentine. Finally, one is to attach a
        piece of turpentine-soaked canvas, which should be “split in the
        middle,” to the end of the sausage that will be connected to the mortar.
        In spite of these helpful details about making the sausage, the recipe
        presents at least three ambiguities in terms of the actual construction
        of the sausage. First, how long should the sausage be? Second, should
        one attach the “long string or cord” inside or outside of the sausage?
        Third, how exactly should one split the turpentine-soaked canvas “in the
        middle in order to wrap &amp; tie it around” the mortar while also
        attaching it to the powder-filled fabric tube and the mortar itself?</p>
    <p>The drawing of the buckram sausage on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/23v/f/23v/tl"><u>23v</u></a>
        provides crucial visual information that helps to bridge the gap between
        the textual description and the material processes of the making of the
        sausage (<i><u>Fig. 2</u></i>). It not only depicts the appearance of
        the sausage, but this illustration also offers a number of clues about
        the sausage’s functions and mechanism as a fuse. The drawing of the
        buckram sausage appears next to the main text of the entry, and it is
        rendered as an elongated form that occupies almost two-thirds of the
        left margin. While the image does not reveal what the actual length of
        the sausage should be, it helps the reader to visualize the proportions
        of its three major components, i.e., the “long string or cord,” the
        turpentine-soaked canvas split in the middle, and the main body of the
        sausage (<i><u>Fig. 3</u></i>). However, while the “long string or cord”
        in the image is significantly longer than the main body of the sausage,
        it is hardly “two times longer” than the main body of the sausage, as
        specified in the text of the recipe. The visual emphasis placed on the
        sausage body, as opposed to the long string, may indicate that the
        sausage body is what is intended to be burnt, whereas the long string
        perhaps serves to make it more convenient for soldiers to hold the
        sausage when lighting it and is of lesser importance.</p>

    <p>More importantly, the image indicates how the three components should be
        positioned and connected with one another. Upon closer examination of
        the middle section of the image, one notices that the lower end of the
        main body of the sausage is closed securely to contain the gunpowder,
        which is not mentioned in the text of the recipe. Moreover, the “long
        string or cord” in the drawing is slightly detached from the main body
        of the sausage in the upper part of the sausage (<i><u>Fig. 4</u></i>).
        This shows how the “long string or cord” should be attached outside of
        the main body of the sausage and, as indicated in the text of the
        recipe, that it should not be tied too tightly to the sausage.</p>

    <p>With this image, the author-practitioner also indicates how one end of
        the sausage should be left open by drawing a few strokes above the upper
        end of the sausage to represent a spark from the gunpowder filling of
        the sausage (<i><u>Fig. 5</u></i>). Additionally, the tiny hatchings
        that resemble zigzags in the drawing show how the turpentine-soaked
        canvas should be sewn, or “tightly” attached, to the end of the sausage
        that is to be connected to the mortar for firing, as indicated in the
        entry text.<a href="#fn5"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref5"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> This piece of turpentine-soaked
        canvas is represented in the image with a split at its end and a line
        drawn down the middle of it (Fig. 3). While it appears that the line
        drawn in the middle of the turpentine-soaked canvas is separate from the
        split, closer examination reveals that the two are actually connected to
        each other by a faded line (<i><u>Fig. 6</u></i> and <i><u>Fig. 7</u></i>). This indicates that the turpentine-soaked canvas has to be cut
        deeply in the middle so that the canvas can be divided into two strips.
        By doing so, one could perhaps fasten or wrap the turpentine-soaked
        canvas strips around the mortar barrel, as described in the recipe text,
        thus connecting the open end of the gunpowder-filled sausage to the
        mortar at the touch-hole (<i><u>Fig. 8</u></i> and <i><u>Fig. 9</u></i>).</p>

    <p>Compared to the images discussed above, the author-practitioner’s
        illustration of the buckram sausage stands out in terms of its
        complexity. This illustration contains subtle details that reveal
        crucial information about the construction of the sausage not mentioned
        in the text of the recipe. However, compared to the images of mortar
        devices on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/167r/f/167r/tl"><u>167r</u></a>,
        the various components of the sausage are depicted in a less systematic
        way. No label is added to help the reader identify the different parts
        of the sausage or to explicate how the image should be read against the
        text. Moreover, as I have shown earlier, the illustration of the sausage
        is at times inconsistent with the recipe’s textual description. Drawn
        with lines that are less solid and less certain, the image of the
        sausage suggests that the author-practitioner struggled to visually
        articulate the material processes of making the sausage.</p>
    <h2 id="mortars-in-ms.-fr.-640">Mortars in Ms. Fr. 640</h2>
    <p>Among the five recipes that touch upon the use and construction of
        mortars in the manuscript, the author-practitioner calls attention to at
        least two types of mortar that can be used for both offensive and
        defensive military operations. The first type has its muzzle facing
        upwards. Fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/23r/f/23r/tl"><u>23r</u></a>
        describes in detail a specific kind of mortar that is cast with four
        handles around the muzzle, and is for “putting below an undermined tower
        with the muzzle pointing up,” or for “putting in breaches” to destroy
        the enemy’s fortification during siege warfare. The author-practitioner
        also adds a drawing to the text of this recipe which shows a mortar with
        its opening facing upwards. In this drawing, a stick is shown passing
        through the ring of one of the handles so that the mortar can be carried
        by men on the battlefield (<i><u>Fig. 13</u></i>). The
        author-practitioner’s representation of the mortar muzzle as facing
        upwards corresponds with a German illustration of mortars found in
        Leonhart Fronsperger’s <em>Kriegßbuch</em>, <em>Ander Theyl</em>, dated
        1573 (<i><u>Fig. 14</u></i>). In Fronsperger’s illustration, one mortar
        has its opening facing almost vertically toward the top, while another
        mortar is set at a high angle. A cannoneer is portrayed holding a long
        match pole and ready for firing in the background.</p>

    <p>The second type of mortar is one which is affixed to a door, window, or
        gate and has its muzzle facing horizontally towards these defenses. This
        type of mortar, which seems to resemble a petard in function, is also
        mentioned on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/23v/f/23v/tl"><u>23v</u></a>,
        where the author-practitioner points out that a mortar which weighs
        forty or fifty pounds is adequate to blow off doors or iron gates. Under
        the heading “<em>Mortiers</em>” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/167r/f/167r/tl"><u>167r</u></a>),

        caption G) to describe a particular type that is used to blow off a door
        (<i><u>Fig. 15</u></i>). The mortar, as shown in the drawing, is cast
        with only one handle; a bent rod inserted through this handle pierces a
        door to fix the mortar to it, with the muzzle of the mortar facing
        towards the door. The drawing also shows a fuse, here depicted as a rod
        burning with smoke, inserted into the mortar’s touch-hole, the opening
        through which the propellant charge in the barrel is ignited.</p>

    <h2 id="the-buckram-sausage-in-context">The Buckram Sausage in Context </h2>
    <p>The textual and visual evidence from Ms. Fr. 640 shows that the buckram
        sausage most likely served as the fuse. Once the sausage body is
        ignited, the spark at the open end of the gunpowder-filled sausage will
        in turn ignite the mortar. The author-practitioner, however, does not
        tell us directly why such an extended fuse is needed for the firing of
        mortars in the first place. Neither does he explain in the recipe why
        the sausage has to be dipped in a mixture of spirits and vinegar, and
        then smeared with turpentine.</p>
    <p>A consideration of the firing mechanism of artillery pieces prevalent in
        sixteenth-century Europe can help contextualize the possible uses of the
        buckram sausage in actual battle, as well as place the manuscript’s text
        and images in a tradition of constructing and using explosive weapons.
        Literature on the history of gunpowder weapons shows that the matchlock
        firing mechanism, which was predominant from the mid fifteenth to the
        early eighteenth century, is closely associated with the use of a “slow
        match.” According to the research of Kenneth Chase and Stuart Reid, a
        “slow match,” or “match cord,” is a slow-burning cotton fuse that is put
        into the touch-hole of the gun barrel to ignite the priming powder
        inside the gun, which will in turn ignite the main charge of the gun
        that propels the projectile.<a href="#fn8"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref8"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> The match has to burn stably and
        slowly so that it will be ready for use anytime on the battlefield. Reid
        identifies several problems that often occur in the use of a slow match.
        First, the cotton-made match is vulnerable to rain and humidity—it does
        not ignite when it becomes wet. Second, the slow-burning match may cause
        accidents when a soldier carrying the match is not attentive to the
        presence of gunpowder. Third, the smoke and the smell generated by the
        glowing match may expose the troop’s location.<a href="#fn9"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref9"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> Concern about the fire and water
        resistance of match cords in particular can be found in Robert Norton’s
        <em>The Gvnner Shewing The Whole Practise Of Artillery</em> (1628).
        Under the heading “To make match that will resist fire and water,”
        Norton offers a recipe that specifies that a “cotton bobbin match as
        bigge as your little finger” should be put into a mixture of liquid that
        is made up of one part of sulfur, a half part of camphor, one part of
        “fine mealed quick Lyme,” together with “so much Lynseed oyle, oyle of
        Petre, a little Vernish liquid.”<a href="#fn10"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref10"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
    <p>While the author-practitioner does not speak of a slow match or a match
        cord anywhere in the manuscript, in his recipe for grenade production on
        fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/24r/f/24r/tl"><u>24r</u></a>,
        he mentions the making of a “pipe [...] which can enter into the hole
        &amp; enter into the middle of the grenade.” More importantly, he
        describes in this recipe how to “temper” the powder for the pipe with
        the use of spirits or vinegar in order to “slow” the powder.
        Specifically, one has to make sure that the powder “will be slow enough
        to allow leisure to throw the grenade without danger.” Although the
        structure of a mortar is significantly different from that of a grenade,
        the short-barreled construction as well as the upward-facing muzzle of
        the mortar makes it necessary for soldiers to keep a distance from the
        mortar muzzle when firing it. The buckram sausage, which serves as a
        lengthy fuse, will help keep the soldiers from injury by the explosive
        power of the cannonball and the recoil of the mortar upon firing.</p>
    <p>In fact, the buckram sausage recipe ends with explicit considerations of
        safety and efficacy. It notes that the gunner “who holds the end of the
        sausage” should “give fire, having gotten himself to safety, &amp; the
        others also.” It also hints at the importance of keeping the sausage
        dry, specifying that “if there was water in the ditch, one would need to
        support the sausage with forks” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/23v/f/23v/tl"><u>23v</u></a>).
        My reconstruction of the buckram sausage was designed to examine whether
        the author-practitioner’s call for the use of specific materials,
        especially spirits, vinegar, and turpentine, could have had an impact on
        the water resistance of the sausage or the pace and stability of the
        burning of the sausage.</p>

    <h2 id="materials-buckram">Materials: “Buckram” </h2>
    <p>The sausage recipe is the only place the term “buckram” appears in the
        manuscript. The French <em>bouquaran</em> is probably synonymous with
        <em>boquerant</em> (i.e., <em>bougran</em> in modern French).<a
           href="#fn11"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref11"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> <em>Bougran</em> corresponds to
        “buckram” in modern English. The etymology of the Oxford English
        Dictionary shows that “bokeram,” “bukeram,” or “buckram” may refer to
        fine linen or cotton fabric, or a kind of coarse linen or cloth that was
        stiffened with gum and paste in the fifteenth and sixteenth century.
        “Buckram” in its modern sense is a stiffened cloth that is used for
        bookbinding, usually being stiffened by soaking in pyroxylin to make
        sure that there is no gap between the fibres.<a href="#fn12"

        to contain gunpowder in the making of the sausage. In fact, the term
        <em>bouquaran</em> is used interchangeably with <em>toile</em> by the
        author-practitioner throughout the recipe. <em>Toile</em> may mean
        canvas, as taken up in the English translation of the manuscript, or
        linen cloth, according to the 1611 French-English dictionary compiled by
        Randle Cotgrave.</p>
    <p>For the purpose of my reconstruction, I used unbleached linen canvas
        instead of the modern buckram used in bookbinding so as to prevent the
        experiment from being affected by the presence of nitrocellulose that is
        used for producing modern buckram. Since the author-practitioner refers
        to <em>bouquaran</em> as <em>toile</em> in the recipe, it is more likely
        that <em>bouquaran</em> is made up of linen than cotton. However, there
        is not enough evidence to determine conclusively whether the term
        <em>bouquaran</em> implies linen or cotton, whether it refers to fine or
        coarse fabric, and whether the fabric had been stiffened or not. As I
        will show below, <em>bouquaran</em> presents one of the most important
        variables for the reconstruction of this recipe.</p>

    <p>Earlier literature on the history of gunpowder indicates that
        large-grained powder was used for larger artillery pieces, such as

        arms, such as handguns.<a href="#fn14"

    <p>Rod Phillips’ recent study of the history of French wine suggests that
        eau-de-vie (<em>eau de vie</em>), which literally means “water of life,”
        was produced by winemakers who distilled wine that could not be sold due
        to occasional oversupply in the market in sixteenth-century France.<a

        distillations and thus has a higher alcohol content. She also suggests
        that an alcohol content as high as 95% could be achieved through
        fractional distillation.<a href="#fn20"

    <h2 id="observations-sewing">Observations: Sewing</h2>
    <p>Following the instructions of the recipe, I sewed two sides of a piece of
        canvas together to form a tube and filled it with short-grain Japanese
        rice.<a href="#fn21"

           role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a> The tightly woven linen canvas I
        used for the reconstruction held the grains of rice very well, even
        though I only sewed with simple, straight, running stitches that did not
        overlap, and I did not make a backstitch to reinforce the seam. However,
        while the recipe specifies that one should use “buckram selvage” for
        sewing, I did not create a selvage for the edges of the canvas that
        would have prevented the fabric from unraveling after cutting it.
        Therefore, the canvas edges appeared to be fraying as I sewed (<i><u>Fig. 16</u></i>). After making the tube, I stitched another piece
        of canvas the size of my palm onto the open end of the sausage, which I
        then cut in the middle. However, since the canvas was the size of my
        palm and was roughly square in shape, it did not correspond with the
        more slender piece of canvas shown in the image of the recipe, which
        seems to be cut deeply in the middle and split into two longer strips so
        that they can be wrapped around a mortar (<i><u>Fig. 17</u></i>).</p>

    <h2 id="observations-burning-tests">Observations: Burning tests</h2>
    <p>For the burning experiment, I prepared three strips of plain canvas and
        three strips of canvas soaked in vinegar and brandy then smeared in
        turpentine (hereafter referred to as “VBT canvas”) to compare how the
        two kinds of canvas would perform after being set on fire. Four days
        prior to the experiment, I soaked the three canvas strips in a mixture
        of 50 ml Rodell Napoleon brandy and 100 ml red wine vinegar of about 5%
        acetic acid. After leaving the canvas strips to dry for two days, I
        coated the strips with turpentine made from the distillation of resin
        from Georgia pine trees. Then I left the turpentine-smeared canvas
        strips to dry for another two days before conducting the burning tests.
    </p>
    <p>I undertook four trials because it turned out to be much more difficult
        than I had expected to simply keep a small piece of canvas burning in
        the heavy airflow of a fume hood. The windiness of the fume hood often
        made the canvas extinguish very quickly. I needed to put the canvas back
        into the flame multiple times to sustain the burning process. It also
        helped to hold the canvas strip steadily and horizontally instead of
        vertically.</p>
    <p>I tried to reduce the variables of the experiment to a minimum in my
        fourth trial, where I held the canvas strips horizontally and did not
        put the strips back into the source of fire again after lighting them.
        The VBT canvas performed better than the plain canvas in terms of
        sustaining the burning process. For the plain canvas, I had to keep the
        strip in the flame for forty-eight seconds to make sure that it burnt
        stably and properly. After being removed from the source of fire,
        however, the plain canvas strip only kept burning for sixteen more
        seconds before extinguishing itself and leaving two-thirds of itself
        unburned. For the VBT canvas, I removed the strip from the flame after
        twenty-three seconds and the strip kept burning for thirty-eight seconds
        more. Only one quarter of the strip was left unburned at the end of the
        trial.</p>
    <h2 id="observations-water-resistance-tests">Observations: Water resistance
        tests</h2>
    <p>I conducted two experiments to compare how the two types of canvas
        performed in repelling water. In the first experiment (the “drop test”),
        I put one drop of water on a plain canvas strip as well as on a VBT
        canvas strip. Then, I observed whether the surface of the two types of
        canvas absorbed the water differently. After that, I turned the two
        strips over and looked at the back of the canvas to assess the level of
        water penetration. In the second experiment (the “dip test”), I first
        weighed the two kinds of canvas strips. Then, I dipped the whole piece
        of both kinds of canvas into water at the same time and took them out
        after about 2 seconds. I weighed them again while they were wet to
        estimate how much water they had absorbed. After leaving them to dry for
        15 minutes, I weighed them again.</p>
    <p>Contrary to my expectation, the plain canvas performed considerably
        better than the VBT canvas in the “drop test” in terms of its ability to
        resist penetration by a small quantity of water. The plain canvas
        absorbed the drop of water noticeably more slowly than the VBT canvas,
        and the absorbed water remained concentrated on a smaller spot on the
        surface of the plain canvas. By contrast, the VBT canvas absorbed the
        drop of water very quickly, and the absorbed water spread out more
        widely across the canvas surface (<i><u>Fig. 18</u></i>). However, the
        VBT canvas dried much more quickly than the plain canvas (<i><u>Fig.
                19</u></i>).</p>

    <p>In the “dip test,” I compared the weight of the two types of canvas
        strips before and after dipping them into water to measure the level of
        water absorption more precisely. The VBT canvas absorbed more water than
        the plain canvas, which is shown by the fact that it gained more weight
        than the plain canvas after being dipped in the water. The VBT canvas
        appeared to have lost more weight than the plain canvas after drying for
        15 minutes. However, when we calculate in terms of percentage, the VBT
        canvas only lost 43% of the weight it had gained after dipping, as
        compared to 58% for the plain canvas, which means that the VBT canvas
        actually did not dry faster than the plain canvas when it had to deal
        with a larger quantity of water. Moreover, even after drying for 15
        minutes, the VBT canvas had gained 0.125g over its original weight,
        which amounted to an additional 96% of its original weight. By contrast,
        the plain canvas only gained 0.055g at the end of the experiment, which
        amounted to 40% of its original weight.</p>
    <h2 id="conclusion">
        <strong>Conclusion</strong>
    </h2>
    <p>The results of my experiments raise a host of significant questions
        regarding the materials and the functions of the buckram sausage. Does
        the use of vinegar, brandy, and turpentine help sustain the burning of
        the sausage rather than enhance its level of water resistance? Is it
        more important for the sausage to dry quickly after being exposed to
        rain than to resist water in the first place? How would the gunpowder
        filling interact with the VBT canvas to make the sausage work? Is canvas
        the right material to use? Finally, is it possible to reconstruct the
        use of a military device under the controlled environment of a
        laboratory, without reproducing the contingencies of warfare?</p>
    <p>The development of early modern military technology and weapon-making
        practices in Europe has been associated with the proliferation of
        arsenals and gun foundries from the fifteenth century onward. Pamela
        Long has identified early modern arsenals as one of the “trading zones”
        where practical and textual knowledge was communicated and exchanged
        among the skilled practitioners and the learned elites.<a href="#fn22"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref22"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a> She also calls our attention to
        how such reciprocal communication between the skilled and the learned
        tended to take place within sites where large-scale state and/or capital
        investment was involved.<a href="#fn23"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref23"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a> This essay shows that the
        translation from practical to textual knowledge and vice versa is never
        straightforward, as the material processes are difficult to fully
        express in text or even with visual aids. Moreover, this study
        demonstrates how contingencies on the battlefield, rather than the
        institutional settings of large-scale, capital-intensive establishments,
        inform the author-practitioner’s conception of how an efficacious
        military device should be made. The buckram sausage recipe shows that
        the author-practitioner is sensitive to the conditions of the
        battlefield—the ditch, the water, the fortification of the enemy, the
        timing of firing, and the safety of the soldiers. If the battlefield
        also constitutes a “trading zone” where both material production and
        knowledge exchange take place, the sausage recipe reminds us that what
        is traded is not only specialized military expertise bounded by the
        established practices of arsenals but also commonplace techniques and
        the experiences of war that helped to harness the explosive qualities of
        gunpowder amid wartime contingencies.</p>
