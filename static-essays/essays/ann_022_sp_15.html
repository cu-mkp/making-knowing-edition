            <p>Of the many entries in Ms. Fr. 640 that contain instructions and
                observations on the lifecasting of plants and animals, those on
                fols. <a

                deal with molding and casting a rose. Like other lifecasting
                entries, these appear to be a record of the
                author-practitioner’s first-hand experience, perhaps even
                evidence that he was learning as he experimented with various
                plants. This essay follows the author-practitioner’s
                instructions for molding and casting a rose, an endeavor that
                required close and repeated reading and trying of many of the
                manuscript’s other entries on the lifecasting of plants and
                animals.</p>

        reconstruction of techniques for the lifecasting of a rose, in which we
        experimented with both one-piece and two-piece molds (the latter can be
        reused to produce multiple copies). A puzzle-like reconstruction of
        information, based on close and iterative reading of Ms. Fr. 640 as a
        whole, was necessary to carry out our experiments. Our efforts revealed
        the significance and extent of the author-practitioner’s experience with
        and interest in lifecasting techniques.</p>
    <p>To reconstruct the procedure from the text, we had to locate information
        on the system of gates (<em>gect</em>), vents (<em>souspirails</em>),
        and wax “veins” (i.e., sprues, <em>filons de cire</em>) necessary for
        both molds, which we did by correlating the clues on fols. 155r and 155v
        with the instructions more explicitly presented in other Ms. Fr. 640
        recipes for lifecasting. We found molding techniques for plants in
        entries related more generally to casting flowers on fols. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/117r/f/117r/tl"><u>117r</u></a>
        and <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/145v/f/145v/tl"><u>145v</u></a>.
        The two-part mold process is described on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/159v/f/159v/tl"><u>159v</u></a>

        illustrate the system of veins, vents, and gates needed to mold crayfish
        and lizards; these were helpful in constructing a two-part mold used to
        cast the leaves of the rose. Several of these recipes will be discussed
        below.</p>
    <p>Our work not only resulted in a beautiful rose cast (<i><u>Fig. 1</u></i>), but also in a reconstruction of the author-practitioner’s evolving
        thoughts on this process as he self-corrects during the course of the
        activities he recorded in the manuscript. We argue that this
        self-reflection reveals him to be continuously learning through his own
        experiments, seemingly motivated by the aspiration both to imitate
        nature and to transform an ephemeral thing into a tangible and fixed
        artistic creation that will remain unchanged. His discussion of the
        gates, veins, and vents in the mold construction reveals his attitude to
        lifecasting as a process requiring great delicacy, and his account as a
        whole stresses the need for repetition and self-correction in order to
        gain mastery. We argue that this self-correction can be seen over the
        sequence of the folios of the recipe. Detailed instructions and changes
        to the procedure that the author-practitioner inserts shows that he may
        be learning through his own making.</p>

    <p>Our goals for the reconstruction included trying to understand the
        author-practitioner’s experimentation with materials in common use,
        including tin, lead, and fish glue, as well as to reconstruct his
        experience as he developed his lifecasting expertise.</p>
    <h2 id="assembling-and-combining-the-texts-of-the-recipes">Assembling and
        Combining the Texts of the Recipes</h2>
    <p>On fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/117r/f/117r/tl"><u>117r</u></a>
        (“A means of molding flowers and plants”) the author-practitioner
        suggests that it is possible to mold a flower or a herb using a
        one-piece mold, but on later fols. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/155r/f/155r/tl"><u>155r</u></a>
        (“Molding a Rose”) and fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/155v/f/155v/tl"><u>155v</u></a>
        (“Rose”), he describes a different casting method. Because a rose has
        several components (flower, stem, leaves, and buds), the
        author-practitioner suggests making a separate mold for each part,
        leaving “little tips” of the small branches at the stem intact in order
        to facilitate joining the pieces after the casting process is complete.
        The reader is instructed to place the flower and its petals as low as
        possible in the mold, instructions which imply that the mold must be
        deep and perhaps that the object be oriented in a vertical position. No
        further instructions are provided regarding this mold. Other recipes in
        the manuscript must be consulted for additional information.</p>
    <p>Fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/117r/f/117r/tl"><u>117r</u></a>
        (“A means of molding flowers and plants”) describes the use of a
        one-piece mold. It is made by shaping a clay slab in the shape of a
        mandore (a type of musical instrument like a lute) surrounded by thick
        walls. The whole flower is inserted into a “a wax stick pointed like a
        large peg” which is in turn supported by a thick iron wire inserted
        through the center of one of the mold walls. In this way, the flower is
        positioned horizontally without touching the mold walls, surrounded by
        space on all sides. This airspace is then filled with wet sand (i.e.,
        plaster of Paris mixed with brick powder), that “will be of equal
        thickness <del>as</del> everywhere &amp; [<del>is</del>]
        <sup>exceed</sup> everywhere by the height of two good fingers the top
        of the <del>such</del> plant.” Once this wet sand is in place, it must
        set before the external clay walls can be removed. After it has set, it
        should be dried for a few days, at which point the mold will be hard and
        dry enough to be put in the oven without cracking. Once in the oven, the
        original rose is reduced to ashes, and the wax elements melted out. This
        then allows the liquid molten metal to flow through the now empty
        “veins” of the former wax sprues and fill the space left by the live
        rose during the actual casting. If the mold is made in one piece, it can
        be used only once, since it must be broken to remove the final cast
        object. If it is designed to separate into two pieces, it can be used
        again.</p>
    <p>In the margin of fol. 117r, two drawings show the flower stem inserted
        into the wax peg and positioned in the mandore-shaped mold. Similar text
        and drawings explaining the arrangement of the casting infrastructure
        are repeated elsewhere in the manuscript, including fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/124v/f/124v/tl"><u>124v</u></a>

        (“Molding a crayfish”), and fol. 145v (“Molding plants and flowers”). On
        both fols. <a

        the author-practitioner suggests casting a delicate flower or plant
        oriented vertically. Additionally, on fol. 117r, he says to “adapt two
        vent holes with two small sticks” to the sides of the wax peg and on
        fol. <a

    <p>By the time the author-practitioner wrote fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/155r/f/155r/tl"><u>155r</u></a>,
        he appears to have refined his mold making technique, since he adds
        specific details like how to arrange a system of wax “veins” or sprues
        that will help the liquid metal flow evenly between the leaves and
        petals. He also suggests making “a vein of wax” from the back of the
        first petal to be joined to the main gate, a description corresponding
        to the wax peg more fully described on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/117r/f/117r/tl"><u>117r</u></a>.
        He seems to assume the reader is aware of the instructions and marginal
        drawings provided on previous folios.</p>
    <p>There are some particular hints regarding the difficult casting of the
        delicate leaves. On fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/155r/f/155r/tl"><u>155r</u></a>
        the author-practitioner briefly mentions making a two-piece mold that
        may be reused, while on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/155v/f/155v/tl"><u>155v</u></a>
        he specifically recommends using a two-piece mold for the leaves and the
        buds. On fol. 155r, he also suggests applying a thin layer of melted
        butter on the outside of the petals to strengthen them during the
        pouring of the wet sand and placing a thread between each petal in order
        to separate them during the casting process. In a note, the
        author-practitioner suggests applying melted butter to the end of the
        rose stem as well, to make it strong enough to support the weight of the
        flower and the leaves once the components are joined. For the same
        reason, he also suggests that the stem be cast in “tinned latten” rather
        than the softer (and cheaper) tin or lead. Otherwise, on fol <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/155r/f/155r/tl"><u>155r</u></a>,
        he suggests tin and lead as casting metals. By contrast, on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/155v/f/155v/tl"><u>155v</u></a>
        he specifically indicates tin as the medium for stem, flower, and
        leaves.</p>
    <p>Other suggestions in the marginal notes include using eau-de-vie to
        moisten the rose and oiling the “wax gate” before pouring in the wet
        sand to diminish the adherence of sand to the casting infrastructure.
        For cleaning the ashes from the mold, the author-practitioner suggests
        waiting for the mold to cool down before blowing out the ashes via the
        small sprues. If the mold is still hot, the ashes will stick to the
        remnants of wax. After casting, the reader is advised to soak the cast
        object in water in order to remove any trace of sand from the petals.
    </p>
    <p>The instructions on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/155r/f/155r/tl"><u>155r</u></a>
        join those on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/155v/f/155v/tl"><u>155v</u></a>
        again when the author-practitioner describes the process of attaching
        the various parts of the cast rose. The procedure of joining the rose
        components is in fact the main subject of fol. 155v. Soldering with
        latten wire is presented as a first option. However, tin “is troublesome
        to solder” without damaging the cast. The author-practitioner thus
        proposes a second option: fish glue. Since “because the cast flowers
        &amp; especially the rose are not beautiful without being painted,” he
        explains, there is no point in soldering when the glue works just as
        well and will be hidden by the paint. The substance may also be used to
        join other elements to the flower (such as for repairing a lifecast fly,
        or attaching a fly to a plant). Once the components are joined, “white
        wax mixed with much <sup>well-ground</sup> ceruse or, even better, lead
        white” can be melted and placed on the joins with a “small hot point of
        iron;” this can also be used to fix imperfections such as “little barbs
        that are in the middle of the rose or the holes <del>of the</del> that
        may be in any petal.” White lead also creates a white ground for colors
        and embellishment.<a href="#fn3"

    <h2 id="reconstruction-experiments">Reconstruction Experiments</h2>
    <p>Our experiments in March 2015 followed the two-week expert maker
        residency in the Making and Knowing Lab of the sculptor and scholar,
        Andrew Lacey. In our first trial we made one-piece molds for all the
        components of the rose: the flower, stem, and leaves. For our second
        experiment, we made a two-piece mold for the leaves with the intention
        of reusing it. In both cases we decided to solder the rose flower to the
        stem and use fish glue to fine-tune details of the cast rose, and then
        apply titanium oxide as a white ground for the painting (time did not
        permit the latter two steps).<a href="#fn4"
           class="footnote-ref"

           role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
    <h3 id="sixteenth-century-roses">Sixteenth-century Roses</h3>
    <p>We made our decision to use a rose as our flower from the titles of the
        recipes, “Rose” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/155v/f/155v/tl"><u>155v</u></a>)
        and “Molding a Rose” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/155r/f/155r/tl"><u>155r</u></a>).
        We selected a modern commercial rose, a choice that might seem
        inauthentic, but, through our research, we learned that by the sixteenth
        century the modern domestic hybrid rose already had been cultivated to
        its now familiar shape. Leonart Fuchs describes two species of rose in
        his 1558 <em>L’histoire des plantes</em>: the wild field rose and the
        domestic rose cultivated in gardens (<i><u>Fig. 3</u></i>).<a
           href="#fn5"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref5"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> The wild rose has a single layer
        of five petals, but various subspecies of the two basic <em>rosa</em>
        had already been hybridized to obtain different colors, fragrance, and
        petal formations (<i><u>Fig. 4</u></i>). Elsewhere in sixteenth-century
        literature, illustrations of domestic white roses exist with several
        layers of petals.<a href="#fn6"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref6"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> The author-practitioner of Ms.
        Fr. 640 does not specify the use of a wild or domestic rose, but the
        marginal drawing of fol. 155r shows a flower with more than five petals,
        which led us to choose a multi-layered hybrid for our test subject (<i><u>Fig. 5</u></i>). Our modern commercial rose, rich in petals, is
        thus a relatively authentic representation of a sixteenth-century hybrid
        rose flower.</p>

    <p>At the beginning of both experiments, we cut the rose blossom and a bunch
        of leaves from the stem, leaving a small bit of the flower stalk on each
        to facilitate the joining process (<i><u>Fig. 6</u></i>). Then we
        prepared to cast the three components according to the information
        collected from fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/155r/f/155r/tl"><u>155r</u></a>.
        Following the earlier suggestion on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/145v/f/145v/tl"><u>145v</u></a>,
        we immersed the flower upside down in a tall glass of eau-de-vie to
        moisten it before placing it on the clay of the mold.</p>

    <p>On the stem and on the back of the petals and leaves, we applied a thin
        layer of melted butter using a brush. We applied wheat oil to the wax
        peg and veins of all three molds.<a href="#fn7"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref7"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> This ensured a smooth surface for
        the sand to flow over. The author-practitioner does not specify a type
        of oil, but he mentions wheat oil in previous recipes involving the
        casting of delicate things.<a href="#fn8"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref8"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> We used melted butter to coat the
        stem, as we were curious to experiment with it on the thicker parts of
        the rose.<a href="#fn9"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref9"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
    <p>Although the author-practitioner suggests using just one thread to
        separate the petals, we found this too difficult and instead used
        several short threads, trying to reach the deepest area between adjacent
        petals (see Fig. 7). In this way, we opened up space that allowed us to
        apply melted butter to small petals that would have otherwise remained
        hidden.</p>
    <p>To make the system of wax veins or sprues, we connected the outside of
        the first petal to the main gate (as suggested on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/155r/f/155r/tl"><u>155r</u></a>),
        while adding two other thin wax sprues to connect the entire flower to
        the clay base of the mold.<a href="#fn10"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref10"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> We followed a similar procedure
        for the stem, making a wax sprue that connected the top of the stem to
        the mold base (<i><u>Fig. 7</u></i>). While the flower and stem looked
        well positioned and stable on the base of the clay, with their stems
        running through the wax peg and supported on both sides by two wax
        sticks), the spray of three leaves seemed fragile (<i><u>Fig. 8</u></i>). The melted butter on their reverse sides seemed to have made them
        heavier and more frail than they really were. Moreover, the system of
        wax veins built to keep them vertical, as described on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/117r/f/117r/tl"><u>117r</u></a>,
        failed when the sand was poured into the mold. As soon as the sand
        touched the base of the mold, the wax peg detached from the clay, the
        little wax sticks and the sprues (connected as shown in the marginal
        drawing on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/155r/f/155r/tl"><u>155r</u></a>)
        broke, and the leaves were lost within the mold. This failure spurred us
        to experiment with casting the leaves in a two-part mold. We were
        encouraged by a remark on fol. 155r to open the molds and clean the
        ashes out. This implies that the author-practitioner had been using a
        two-part mold for the leaves, the same method he recommends for
        lifecasting small animals, such as crayfish, found elsewhere in the
        manuscript (e.g., fol. 159v).</p>

    <p>In our second experiment, we placed the spray of leaves on the base of
        the mold and built thick clay walls all around.<a href="#fn11"

        On the contrary, we needed to prevent the clay from attaching to the

        instructions on fol. <a

    <p>Our next challenge was to construct a system of wax sprues that would
        connect the leaves as illustrated in the marginal drawing on fol. 155r (<i><u>Fig. 10</u></i>). Deviating from the diagram, however, we did not
        make the two <em>souspirails</em> (vents) right away, because, according
        to fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/155r/f/155r/tl"><u>155r</u></a>,
        the vents should be made after the object being cast had been burnt out:
        “You <del>them</del> can also mold well the leaves of rose bushes,
        strawberry plants, &amp; similar things that are flat &amp; can be
        flattened without spoiling them with two gates, for opening your mold
        when it is reheated, &amp; cleaning the ashes from it, <del>All</del>
        and making vents &amp; several gates.” Here, the author-practitioner
        seems to suggest incising the vents directly into the mold after opening
        it and cleaning out the ashes (<i><u>Fig. 11</u></i>).<a href="#fn12"

           id="fnref12"

    <p>Of the several kinds of sand suggested for casting in Ms. Fr. 640, the
        author-practitioner specifies one type on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/159v/f/159v/tl"><u>159v</u></a>
        (“Carnation”), writing that when it comes to molding flowers and
        delicate things “one needs very thin sand &amp; to blow strongly.” On
        the following fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/160r/f/160r/tl"><u>160r</u></a>
        (“Sand for flowers”), he notes,</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>If it is cast thick, it bears down too much on the flowers &amp;
            constricts them &amp; reduces them as if massed together. Take heed
            therefore to temper it until thin, &amp; blow strongly before the
            flower is covered. Cast at the side of the mold. And tempering the
            sand, one ought not only to turn the spatula but to beat the sand in
            water as if you were beating glair of egg.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Based on previous experiments in the lab, we decided that the mixture
        described in “For casting in silver” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/121v/f/121v/tl"><u>121v</u></a>)
        was most suitable for our use. It is the most detailed recipe and is
        used for lifecasting an animal, and specifies “4 parts of plaster, of
        two parts reheated brick, &amp; one part reheated <sup>feather</sup>
        alum.” We used a proportion of two parts plaster of Paris to one of
        brick dust and increased the quantity of sal ammoniac from two teaspoons
        to four for this trial (we did not use “feather alum” for any trial).<a

           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref13"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> Consequently, this mold took
        much longer to dry before we could put it in the oven and burn out the
        leaves (<i><u>Fig. 13</u></i>). We also had to pour the sand into the
        mold in two goes, as we did not mix enough at first. The final cast of
        the rose reflects this addition through a sharp line on the outside of
        the first petal (<i><u>Fig. 14</u></i>).<a href="#fn14"

    <p>We were now at the point that we had to select the metal alloy for
        casting the components. While on fol. <a

        the author-practitioner let the reader choose between tin or lead, on

        he assumes that tin will be used to cast all the rose elements. For all
        our experiments we decided to use an alloy of tin and lead, following
        the author-practitioner’s recommendation on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/116v/f/116v/tl"><u>116v</u></a>
        for “Mixture of tin and lead,” for “delicate plants &amp; other flowers
        or thin foliage,” because we had already experimented with casting in
        pure tin during the residence of expert maker Andrew Lacey.<a

        medal we had cast in pure tin during a previous class experiment. This
        result has the advantage of resolving the author’s concern that the

        the author-practitioner changed his opinion on what metal should be used
        in lifecasting during the writing of the manuscript. A mixture of tin
        and lead is suggested earlier on fol. <a

        the author-practitioner, in viewing tin as “troublesome,” seems to share
        Vannoccio Biringuccio’s low opinion of the alloy. The latter author
        states in his <em>Pirotechnia</em> that tin is “not better for any work
        when mixed than when pure, except for the advantage of the master, who …
        sells lead that is worth little for tin that is worth much.”<a

    <p>The beauty of the final rose cast derives from the richness of those
        lifelike details stiffened by the melted butter and fixed by the metal
        alloy (see Fig. 1).<a href="#fn18"

        spray of leaves in a one-piece mold was a failure, those cast in the
        two-piece mold turned out well and contributed to the final detail of
        the cast object (<i><u>Fig. 15</u></i>). That part of our experiment
        also proves the efficacy of laying the fragile leaves down in the mold
        and using eau-de-vie to keep sand from adhering (<i><u>Fig. 16</u></i>).

        (“Carnation”), where the author-practitioner says that, while it is
        possible to successfully mold any kind of flower whole in a one-piece
        mold, if multiple casts are desired, the plant should be cut into its
        components and a one-piece mold made for the stem and flower, while a
        reusable two-piece mold is made for the leaves: “[The carnation] is
        molded like the rose, marigold &amp; all other flowers thus, as is said,
        namely, whole-mold flowers, &amp; all the leaves, if you want, in two
        halves, joining them by solder for the most secure way, even if you
        could mold them together in a closed mold.”<a href="#fn21"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref21"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a> The text from this folio, late
        in the manuscript, expresses not only the author-practitioner’s
        technical achievement in flower casting, but perhaps also communicates
        his increased confidence in the process as a way to fix the ephemeral in
        a physical object.</p>
    <p>We studied this development of the author-practitioner’s skill in casting
        delicate things by analyzing the details provided throughout the
        manuscript on the materials and techniques used to create lifecasts of
        plants and animals. Our research presented here aims to provide a better
        understanding of lifecasting techniques and of the author-practitioner’s
        process of learning through practice that we detected throughout the
        manuscript. But we also seek to contribute to the study of casting
        practices for small and delicate things in early modern Europe, a
        subject scarce in primary sources.<a href="#fn22"

    <p>In sixteenth-century Europe, flowers like roses were associated with the
        concept of physical beauty subject to the damage of passing time.<a
           href="#fn23"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref23"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a> With this in mind, our work of
        reconstructing the author-practitioner’s experiments demonstrates that
        the lifecasting process is not merely a sequence of technical steps. On
        the contrary, lifecasting is a unique opportunity to give permanence to
        an animate, delicate thing in a manner that preserves its intrinsic form
        and beauty (<i><u>Fig. 20</u></i>). This artistic practice thus becomes
        one of the author’s main preoccupations throughout the manuscript. His
        intensive effort to perfect the process of lifecasting through
        experimentation with “veins,” “breathing holes,” and many varieties of
        alloys and molds reveals the goal to suspend the ravages of nature and
        fix the ephemeral form of a living rose in metal.</p>

                <p>Following what we learned while experimenting in molding
                    roses during Andrew Lacey’s residence in the Making and
                    Knowing Lab (March 2015), the construction of our one- and
                    two-piece molds required a base one inch wider than the cast
                    object, while the walls had to be two inches taller than the
                    object to assure that the sand completely covered and
                    surrounded the cast object.<a href="#fnref11"

                <p>Our protocol for the sand recipe was based on experience
                    gained during the March 2015 residency of Andrew Lacey. The
                    increase of the amount of sal ammoniac is explained by the
                    fact that the two-piece mold built for the bunch of leaves
                    was much larger than the one-piece mold made for the

                <p>Vannoccio Biringuccio’s 1540 <em>Pirotechnia</em> suggests

                    iron scale to mold “every smallest thing, however thin it
                    might be.” Although he does not specify if this includes

                <p>Ms. Fr. 640, fol. 116v, “For delicate plants &amp; other
                    flowers or thin foliage, the fine tin ought to exceed the
                    lead more than three parts. And if it is a thick &amp;
                    coarse material, the lead ought to exceed by more than three
                    parts. Heat the mostly tin mixture until it is almost red
                    &amp; very hot. And when you want to cast, in removing your
                    crucible from the fire, throw in two or three grains of
                    rosin, &amp; for one lb &amp; a half or two of lead or tin,
                    put with the rosin as much looking-glass tin as the size of
                    a hazelnut with its shell, &amp; mix &amp; cast. And make
                    sure that there is more of the metal than is needed, in
                    order that some is left. However, if there is not enough,
                    finish casting, &amp; it will take. But it will not be so
                    neat. Next, dip your mold into water, &amp; with a point,
                    release it carefully so that nothing is spoiled. Make your
                    cast a bit longer. If the material is very thin, one needs

                    will be soon dry, heating it from afar. Next, cover lightly
                    the joints of the reattached thing with some modeling wax,
                    which is white wax mixed with a lot of ceruse or lead white,
                    melting it well with a hot iron point. You will also cut

                <p>Fish glue had other useful applications. Cennino Cennini
                    mentions it in the context of restoration: “this glue is
                    made from various kinds of fish [….] It is good and
                    excellent for mending lutes and other fine paper, wooden, or

                    Daniel V. Thompson (New York: Dover, 1969), 66–67. Daniel V.

                        Paintings</em> (New York: Dover, 1956), 58–61, describes
                    a similar application of the fish glue for mending
                    parchment, while also stating that “the chief importance of
                    both size and fish glue in illumination was to act as a
                    binder for the grounds upon which gold leaf was made.” The

                <p>In another contemporary source describing the lifecasting of
                    flowers and plants, Hugh Plat also describes both types of
                    mold. Plat does not suggest a two-piece mold exclusively for
                    use with leaves, but implies this technique should be
                    applied to the whole flower or plant being cast. It would be
                    interesting to experiment with creating a two-piece mold for
                    a whole flower, and to thus verify why our
                    author-practitioner is determined to cut the flower in
                    pieces and use a double mold only for the leaves.
                    Unfortunately Plat’s instructions are very vague, and would
                    be difficult to understand without previous study and
                    experimentation with Ms. Fr. 640. This example reinforces
                    the conclusion that the lifecasting procedure in Ms. Fr. 640
                    is detailed and thoughtful. Hugh Plat, <em>The Jewell House
