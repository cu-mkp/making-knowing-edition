        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <div>
            <p>BnF Ms. Fr. 640 offers a wealth of information on gunpowder
                weapons. During the wars of religion, gun technology was of the
                utmost importance, not only for those who produced these
                instruments of war, but also for those who made a profession of
                arms and had to ensure that these guns were safe to use. This
                essay examines the entries in Ms. Fr. 640 relating to weapons
                against the backdrop of this turbulent period in and around
                Toulouse, and compares them to other sources that treat
                gunpowder weaponry in sixteenth-century Europe.</p>

    <p>The text of BnF Ms. Fr. 640, set down in Toulouse after 1579 by an
        anonymous author-practitioner, offers a wealth of information to readers
        interested in all sorts of weapons. The wars of religion are an
        important context for Ms. Fr. 640, as Toulouse was much involved in the
        warfare, and, from 1562 on, Catholics and Protestants fought fiercely in
        the area.<a href="#fn1"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref1"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> In 1562 violence erupted when the
        local people, mainly Catholics, confronted the Protestant urban elites
        who had seized the town hall. The city took up arms to defend the
        Catholic cause and many Protestants were killed. The Catholic League,
        extending its power in Toulouse, expended extensive funds upon military
        equipment and the payment of soldiers. In 1563, Toulouse’s treasurers
        partially financed the siege of Montauban and paid for provisions and
        artillery ordnance. In 1570, Gaspard de Coligny, Seigneur de Châtillon,
        Protestant Admiral of France, advanced with his army upon the city,
        justifying its military preparations. In 1572, after the St.
        Bartholomew’s Day massacre in Paris, the Capitouls and the Parlement
        gave the order to arrest the remaining Protestants in the city. In 1586,
        Toulouse supported the governor of Languedoc, Marshall de&nbsp;Joyeuse,
        with ordnance and ammunition.<a href="#fn2"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref2"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
    <p>In 1589, Bishop Urbain de&nbsp;Saint Gelais, closely related to the Guise
        family, became governor of the city.<a href="#fn3"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref3"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> Some time afterward, however,
        Duke Guillaume de&nbsp;Joyeuse reentered the city, and Toulouse remained
        under the control of his family, all the while supplying his army in
        Languedoc with guns and gunpowder. In 1590–92, there were still two
        Protestant strongholds in the villages of Montastruc and Miremont, and
        Toulouse sent a large quantity of weapons<a href="#fn4"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref4"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> to the army of Joyeuse entrenched
        before these towns. This war continued on through 1595 in the
        neighborhood of Tournefeuille, Portet, St. Sulpice, Lézat, and
        Vitarelles de&nbsp;Montech.<a href="#fn5"

    <p>During these turbulent decades, weapons technology was thus of utmost
        importance, and it is not surprising that the author-practitioner took
        an interest in it, perhaps even meeting with the principal cannon
        founders in the Royal arsenal of Toulouse. The knowledge he gathered on
        weapons was of great importance to nobles and the social elite leading
        the troops, but also to various kinds of practitioners, lower officers,
        and gunners, for whom it might eventually pave the way for social
        mobility. The intended audience for the gunnery sections of Ms. Fr. 640
        was not professional founders and other metalworkers making the weapons,
        but rather people who used the guns and needed to judge the quality of
        the weaponry (for example, by scratching the gun to see the alloy, noted
        on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/17r/f/17r/tl"><u>17r</u></a>),
        which was very important for several reasons—not least for determining
        whether the gun was likely to explode.</p>
    <h2 id="sources-on-weaponry-in-sixteenth-century-france">Sources on Weaponry
        in Sixteenth-Century France</h2>
    <p>Ms. Fr. 640 contains remarkably detailed information on guns and gunnery.
        Where did this information come from? I examine first the passages about
        gunnery (fols. 17r–19v). The <em>Rezeptliteratur</em> (recipe
        literature) about gunnery goes back to the early fifteenth century when
        the first <em>Feuerwerkbücher</em> (gunpowder books) were written in
        Germany.<a href="#fn6"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref6"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> These collections of practical
        recipes for gunners were widely disseminated very early on. A French
        version of a <em>Feuerwerkbuch</em> is the <em>Livre du secret de l’art
            de canonnerie</em>, which continued to circulate through the
        sixteenth century.<a href="#fn7"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref7"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> The type of questions that fill
        these texts suggest that they might have been used for interviewing

           id="fnref8"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> Fifteenth- and sixteenth-century

           role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> Fortunately, however, higher
        officers in the craft also wrote a number of texts apparently containing
        similar information.<a href="#fn10"

           id="fnref10"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> Printed sources on gunnery in
        this period are rather meager, but Jean Errard’s
        <em>La&nbsp;Fortification réduite en art</em> (1595), and Jean
        Hanzelet’s <em>Pyrotechnie</em> (1630) are relevant texts that help us
        to understand the anonymous author-practitioner. Contemporary texts also
        existed in English in the period,<a href="#fn11"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref11"

    <p>Even compared to these texts, the sections on artillery in Ms. Fr. 640
        provide a wealth of information about the state of the art at the end of
        the sixteenth century. Their form suggests that the author was not a gun
        founder himself but rather he collected knowledge in discussions with
        practitioners.</p>
    <p>A first section in Ms. Fr. 640 concerns entries about grenades and
        fireworks (fol. <a

        a second one deals with the diversity of a gunner’s activities,
        including firing a cannon at night, unspiking a cannon, defending a
        town, bringing a cannon over land, among others, as well as with
        different kinds of shots and different kinds of pieces (fols. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/21r/f/21r/tl"><u>21r</u></a>–<a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/28r/f/28r/tl"><u>28r</u></a>).
        A third section deals with portable pieces like arquebuses (fols. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/43v/f/43v/tl"><u>43v</u></a>–<a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/45r/f/45r/tl"><u>45r</u></a>),
        and a fourth section, spread over two parts, details what a petard is
        (fol. <a

    </p>
    <p>This essay offers a threefold overview of these entries: The first part
        deals with the different kinds of cannons with which the
        author-practitioner was acquainted in Toulouse and the gunnery
        techniques he observed there. The second part treats gun casting and
        boring techniques. The third part discusses the techniques used for
        defending or attacking a place.</p>
    <h2 id="first-to-know-ones-peece-the-art-of-the-gunner">“First, to know
        one’s peece”: The Art of the Gunner</h2>
    <p>According to English author Richard Wright, the knowledge required of a
        gunner was “to know his peece, to know the powder and how to make
        saltpeter, to know the despart of his metall, to lay his peece, to know
        the carriages, to use the quadrant, to shoot at poynt blanke and at
        diverse angles of random, to make laddles and cartridges, to make
        fireworks and gabions.”<a href="#fn13"

        in Ms. Fr. 640.</p>
    <h3 id="calibers">Calibers</h3>
    <p>“To know his peece” meant primarily to know the different types of
        cannons and their calibers, which takes up fols. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/21r/f/21r/tl"><u>21r</u></a>–<a

        in Ms. Fr. 640. There were four families of cannons: culverins, cannons,
        falcons, and mortars. Each weapon had its proper use: cannons to open a
        breach during a siege, culverins for breaches too, but from afar with
        more powder, mortars for parabolic shots over walls, potentially with
        incendiary projectiles, and lighter and mobile falcons and falconets to
        be used on the field (campaign artillery) alongside infantry and
        cavalry, or to destroy besieged gunners.</p>
    <p>Gun size had been stabilized under Henri II&nbsp;when his commissaries
        (among whom was Jean d’Estrées) defined the 6 calibers of France, but no
        real standardization was actually achieved for a long while. Bolognese
        engineer and military author Francesco De&nbsp;Marchi left a detailed
        description of the French reform in a report to the Duke of Parma dated
        1553.<a href="#fn14"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref14"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> The six types of caliber in this
        report were the cannon and the demi-cannon (counting for one), the
        culverin, the bastard-culverin, the sacre, the falcon, and the falconet.
        Rationalizing the calibers was a means to save money because it
        standardized ammunition. Around 1580, Abra Raconis described precisely
        the six categories for the Paris arsenal, near the Celestins convent.<a

    <p>Standardization was in fact a Europe-wide phenomenon, with the Italians
        and Spaniards imitating the French. The English had already defined ten
        calibers in 1543 under Henry VIII, and again in the 1590s, Cyprian Lucar
        reduced them to 9 categories (double cannon, cannon, half cannon,
        quarter-cannon, culverin, sacre, minion, falcon, falconet). The
        proportions and figures given by sixteenth-century English treatises can
        be compared with the data provided by a French manuscript by Abra
        Raconis on French calibers.<a href="#fn16"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref16"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> Comparing the tables given in
        English sources to those of Raconis on French calibers reveals numerous
        discrepancies due both to their chronology and to the fact that,
        although different realms sought standardization internally, it did not
        extend beyond their borders.</p>
    <h3 id="culverins">Culverins</h3>
    <p>Culverins such as those described by the author-practitioner are
        characterized by their proportions, and especially by the ratio between
        their caliber and their length (volley): more or less 1:30. The long
        volley was used to guide the projectiles and to compress the gas of the
        explosion within the chamber during a longer period of time. Their
        length oscillated between 4 and 5 meters (18 <em>pans</em>) and their
        weight around 4 tons. They could shoot bullets weighing between 30 and
        40 lbs. up to 4500 paces. Culverins were probably the costliest and most
        sophisticated weapons of their day (<i><u>Fig. 2</u></i>). At the end of
        the sixteenth century, they were much safer than previously, and,
        according to the Italian Girolamo Cataneo, they could fire up to 45
        times a day.<a href="#fn17"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref17"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> A demi-culverin (35 quintals,

        used to destroy smaller pieces of fortification like gabions. The
        author-practitioner names these guns and their shot, but tends to use
        local units of measurement.<a href="#fn18"

    <p>It appears that gunners were especially aware of the particular use of
        their pieces. As a result, a siege was like a chess game in which pieces
        had characteristics that were powerful in combination. The abilities of
        culverins varied considerably. When one compares pieces kept in museums
        with the characteristics given by Ms. Fr. 640 and with the figures
        provided by Abra Raconis or De&nbsp;Marchi, it seems impossible to
        establish a standard rule. In theory, however, a bastard could shoot
        bullets of 18 lbs. and a demi-culverin, bullets of 12 lbs. The main
        inconvenience of the culverin was its cost. In the late sixteenth
        century, after a long debate involving, among others, Niccolò Tartaglia,
        the first great theoretician of ballistics, the efficiency of oversized
        volleys was challenged by specialists.<a href="#fn19"

    <h3 id="cannons">Cannons</h3>
    <p>The second family of cannons were preferred for breaching shots (that is,
        shots capable of destroying a fortified wall) at short distance by means
        of batteries.<a href="#fn20"

        their caliber and their length is approximately 1:18 or 1:20. Their
        calibers were usually larger than those of culverins (10 to 40&nbsp;lbs.
        for the double cannon) (<i><u>Fig. 3</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 4</u></i>).</p>

        a French author and diplomat of the period also known for his interests

        were two kinds of cannons circa 1560: simple cannons weighing
        3000&nbsp;lbs. and reinforced cannons weighing 5000&nbsp;lbs. Each royal
        regulation for ordinary cannons (<em>calibre de roi</em>) defined the
        different sorts of cannons, and, within the family, distinguished
        between double cannons (used for the siege of Pignerol circa 1570),
        courtauds (a term coined in Burgundy), serpentines, and perriers (the
        name suggests they initially shot stone bullets).<a href="#fn22"

    <blockquote>
        <p>The cannon fires at point-blank from five to six hundred paces. But

            be any farther. Its ball commonly weighs 40 lb of the King’s
            caliber. There is a cannon-perrier, which weighs xxv quintals, which
            are small, short cannons. It is for fighting the ditch casemates
            &amp; for battering at close range. It bears a large ball of the
            King’s caliber like the others, namely of 40 lb (fol. <a

    <p>Another category of pieces in the family of cannons&nbsp;was mortars.
        They were adapted to ballistic shots and are mentioned in inventories
        (in Amiens, for instance) and appear in contemporary representations,
        for example of the siege of Boulogne by Henry VIII, and the siege of
        Alesia by Melchior Feselen (<i><u>Fig. 5</u></i>).<a href="#fn23"

    <p>The “pièce de campagne,” or field piece, is altogether different:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>The field piece weighs ten or twelve quintals &amp; is ten pans long
            or 12. Its ball weighs vi or vii lb &amp; its charge is 4 lb of
            powder […] Their caliber is also small, which makes the breech 3
            balls thick. They are used for following a camp promptly &amp; for
            the defense of cities &amp; houses, putting them on the walls or on
            a tower (fol. <a
               href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/18v/f/18v/tl"><u>18v</u></a>).

    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>This piece of artillery figured as an
        intermediary between the cannon and the falcon, weighing 10 to 12
        quintals, measuring about 2.2 meters and shooting bullets of 6 to 7 lbs.
        It also relates to the passe-volant which is just a bit smaller but
        shoots bullets of 2 lbs. The main characteristic of these pieces, which
        could be drawn by only two horses, was their extreme mobility. In the
        municipal archives of Toulouse, these pieces are frequently mentioned
        from 1562 to 1605.<a href="#fn24"

        </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Some archaic pieces also survived in late sixteenth-century Toulouse,
        like iron “fowlers,” which the author-practitioner mentions as
        <em>canons a chambre</em> on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/24v/f/24v/tl"><u>24v</u></a>.
        Fowlers are those which have reinforcements on the interior in the
        entire space which contains the&nbsp;powder<em>.</em> Fowlers, forged
        rather than cast, with their removable chambers, belong to a tradition
        going back to the previous century and were fairly cheap to produce.</p>
    <h3 id="falcons">Falcons</h3>
    <p>Another family of guns is that of falcons. The animal denominations, with
        pieces named after snakes and birds of prey, is anthropologically
        meaningful. The esmeril, the falcon, the falconet, the sacre, were birds
        of prey used by aristocrats for hunting. As artillery pieces, they were
        easy to move, could approach close to the walls, and could be used to
        back up infantry or cavalry units. They could also defend fortresses, as
        Raconis mentions: “Falconets, arquebus à croc, muskets and other small
        pieces, are of such calibers that are used for defending a place or for
        a war campaign<em>.</em>”<a href="#fn25"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref25"

        use described by the author-practitioner, who added that they were
        useful for the defense of fortified houses (<em>maisons fortes</em>):

    <blockquote>
        <p>The falconet weighs 4&nbsp;quintals, is x&nbsp;pans&nbsp;long. Its
            ball weighs one&nbsp;lb&nbsp;&amp; a quarter, its charge is half
            a&nbsp;lb&nbsp;of&nbsp;powder.&nbsp;At the breech three balls, at
            the front, two. To move it, two&nbsp;horses, although
            such&nbsp;pieces&nbsp;are hardly moved insofar as they only serve to
            defend&nbsp;houses. The ones which are carted around either for
            battery or for siege combat, are&nbsp;cannons,&nbsp;culverins,
            medium-sized bastardes&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;field pieces (fol. <a

    </blockquote>
    <p>The author-practitioner ends his description with arquebus à croc (wall
        guns) (<i><u>Fig. 6</u></i>), double muskets, and muskets, that is,
        pieces served by two or even only one person for the defense of places
        (not to be mistaken for the personal arquebus). Their weight (from 1 to
        2 quintals) forbids use on the field.</p>

            through these notches one passes the hook of the arquebus which has
            a hole through which one passes iron pegs from under the board.
            Then, when one wants to aim it, one mounts the middle one &amp; that
            on both sides. If you want to make a double row, or triple or
            quadruple or more, you need only place a similar row of boards like

        tubes of arquebuses, were especially useful for the defense of gates.
        Leonardo da&nbsp;Vinci’s drawings of artillery organs are particularly
        famous, but such pieces, called <em>ribaudequins</em> in France and
        Burgundy, were in use in Northern Europe decades before Leonardo drew
        them. Recently, in the Musée de l’Armée, Paris, a <em>ribaudequin</em>
        from the 1550s was reconstructed out of surviving tubes, which provides

    <h3 id="elements-of-the-peece">Elements of the “peece”</h3>
    <p>A gunner also had to be knowledgeable about the diverse elements of a
        piece, such as breech, volley, mouth or muzzle, trunnions, excess metal,
        bore or barrel, and the author-practitioner rehearses all these:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>There are three reinforcement rings on a&nbsp;cannon, one at the
            breech, one in the middle, one at the mouth. When founders want to
            work on their craft or render the&nbsp;cannon&nbsp;or other piece
            lighter &amp; easier to cart around, they make it from the ring at
            the breech to the ring in the middle of the thickness &amp;
            proportion of the balls, as is said above. But from the ring in the
            middle to the ring of the mouth&nbsp;<del>&amp;</del>&nbsp;they
            diminish it one&nbsp;line, or more or less, on each side, always
            taking their measurements with the&nbsp;compass&nbsp;from the
            straight line which they make in the middle of the&nbsp;model
            of&nbsp;paper&nbsp;or otherwise (fol. <a
               href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/25v/f/25v/tl"><u>25v</u></a>).
        </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>Interestingly, the author-practitioner
        refers here to the transmission of this knowledge through written
        expertise and the use of the compass.</p>
    <h2 id="gun-casting-boring-techniques-and-shot">Gun Casting, Boring
        Techniques, and Shot</h2>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>Each piece had so many singular
        characteristics that a gunner had to become accustomed to its
        individuality in order to serve it: not only to learn its balance but
        also to understand the quality of the chamber, that is, whether the
        piece was well bored, with a regular windage (the space between the
        bullet and the chamber). For that operation, the gunner could use
        special instruments: parallel staffs, or a metal instrument to grip the
        piece in every place to know the thickness of the metal (fol.&nbsp;<a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/25v/f/25v/tl"><u>25v</u></a>).
        A too-large volley could induce a loss of pressure and diminish the
        speed of the bullet. An irregular volley could block the bullet and make
        the piece explode. Irregularities within the volley would also
        jeopardize the life of the gunner because hollows or protrusions could
        fix a bit of grit that would ignite the gunpowder at the wrong time.
        Controlling the windage was thus essential.
        <br>
        Wadding and ramming in charging were the other conditions of a good
        shot. This explains why each piece of artillery was supplemented by
        pieces of equipment used by gunners and mates: powder ladles, sponges,
        rammers, and pieces for the carriage. The ladles were especially
        important as a means to unburden the gunners from measuring the
        necessary loads:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>One charges with the ladle all pieces from the cannon to the piece of
            four quintals <em>
                <del>de char</del>
            </em>, and one gives them two ladles of cannon powder or one &amp; a
            half of arquebus powder. To smaller ones, one only gives one ladle,
            &amp; those of one quintal are charged with a small charge (fol. <a
               href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/18v/f/18v/tl"><u>18v</u></a>).
        </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>A <em>lanterne</em> or ladle was a sort of
        semi-cylindrical shovel open at the top, attached to a staff the length
        of the barrel channel. It constituted an early form of gauging. The
        gunner had to load the ladle to the end of the gun bore and then turn
        the ladle upside down so that the black-powder would stay within the
        barrel. The gesture had to be precise enough not to spread any grains of
        powder along the chamber. Ladles were also used to measure the volume of
        powder, thus each piece had its own ladle. Luis Collado’s Italian
        treatise on gunnery offers schemes of ladles shown in proportion to a
        certain number of bullets, which is exactly what Ms. Fr. 640 also
        describes on fol. 18v.<a href="#fn26"

    <p>Cartridges (<em>cartouches</em> or <em>gargousses</em>) went a step
        further, although at the cost of a necessary preparation of paper or
        canvas: “Some have invented to load the cannons with cartridges” (fol.

        that some bullets were also cast in bronze, although it was more costly:

    <blockquote>
        <p>Some make a mold of the caliber of the piece, &amp; temper it, then
            beat a soft iron piece cut to size, &amp; when this piece is very
            red, they beat it into the mold &amp; round it off with a large
            file, considering these balls to be stronger than the melted ones
            which, being brittle, are more subject to breaking (fol. <a
               href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/16r/f/16r/tl"><u>16r</u></a>).
        </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Ms. Fr. 640 also alludes to gun casting through considerations about the
        proportions of metals used (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/17r/f/17r/tl"><u>17r</u></a>).
        Most cannons in the sixteenth century were made of bronze, although from
        the 1540s there were some marginal experiments in Normandy (Breteuil) on
        less expensive guns made of cast-iron (naval artillery). Some archaic
        forged guns also survived in some arsenals belonging to local
        aristocrats. However, cannons made of bronze were more robust and could
        withstand the forces created by the explosion of huge loads of powder
        and by the percussion of iron bullets within the volley. A new alloy was
        necessary that contained a reduced portion of tin in comparison to the
        alloy previously used for bells (80/20). Ms. Fr. 640 is especially
        valuable because those proportions are detailed for each kind of piece.
    </p>
    <p>The pieces were made of copper, tin, and rosette copper (reddish copper).
        Tin plus rosette copper produced an alloy called <em>metal</em>. A
        falconet belonging to the town of Saint-Lys that was made in Toulouse,
        shown at the Musée des&nbsp;Augustins during the exhibition “Toulouse
        Renaissance,” shows the reddish color of the metal (<i><u>Fig. 8</u></i>).<a href="#fn30"

    <p>Strangely, although the author was probably himself an expert in small
        casting techniques, the text does not describe the process of casting
        cannons. It provides no clues about the molds, nor about the furnaces,
        nor the casting pits, although in an entry on “Foundry casting” (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/15r/f/15r/tl"><u>15r</u></a>)
        he does mention that “one casts large works such as artillery, bells and
        similar.” There were significant differences between the casting of
        large and small objects, and, where the author-practitioner experiments
        constantly with the casting of small objects, his observations about gun
        casting are less experimental and more documentary, a tone that suggests
        he only had second-hand knowledge of gun founding.</p>
    <p>To gain more information about the casting and construction of guns, we
        must turn to Abra Raconis’s treatise which described a process very
        similar to that given by Leonardo da&nbsp;Vinci in Milan in the
        1490s,&nbsp;with clay molds and models strengthened with horse hair and
        bands of iron.<a href="#fn31"

    <h3 id="gun-boring">Gun Boring</h3>
    <p>If casting techniques used in the arsenals of Paris and Malines are not
        described by the author-practitioner, one passage of Ms. Fr. 640 deals
        precisely with gun-boring techniques:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>They are very difficult to bore when they are of <em>metal</em>
            because the substance is brittle &amp; frangible. But one <em>
                <del>z</del>
            </em> ought not to push the borer with too great a force nor
            continue all in one push, but pull it out often. In that case, one
            makes the <del>touch-hole</del> muzzle of the cannon bigger than the
            ball in order to avoid the necessity of boring, because the
            substance is cast &amp; expands &amp; pushes the mold. If the borer,
            which should be neither like a swallow tail nor a point but be cut
            in the round like a wimble, if it breaks, one ought not to leave it
            there to rust (fol. <a

    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>Such techniques were described in the

        cutters fixed on a cylindrical shape acting together on the bore, while
        Biringuccio only mentions four cutters (<i><u>Fig. 9</u></i>). It

    <p>Artillery and undermining techniques used to take a city or a fortress is
        another important theme of Ms. Fr. 640. Most vivid here is the
        description of a battery and its platform. Thomas Digges, in
        <em>Stratioticos</em>, stated that “the inequalitie of the ground or
        platforme, and wheeles of the carriadge reculing” was a great cause of
        problems for a gunner, as much as irregular boring or the tempering of
        the piece hot or cold.<a href="#fn33"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref33"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a> The author-practitioner was well
        aware of such problems when he wrote:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Once one is close to the place one wants to batter, the gunner goes
            at night to reconnoiter the most convenient place to mount the
            battery &amp; if he does not see well, one gives a false alarm in
            order that those on the inside throw torches. Very often, one
            batters where it is strongest because the assailed, disdaining the
            battery, do not make repairs there. Commonly, there are not many
            garrets &amp; other defenses in that place. And when one has made a
            breach at the strongest part &amp; the cannon removed, it will
            surprise the assailed. One approaches fortified towns at night, but
            to poorly fortified towns, pioneers bring gabions and once these are
            placed, one puts some boards or planks behind the gabions to keep
            the pioneers safe, while behind, they fill the gabions with some
            earth by means of their shovels. And while one does this, one raises
            some false alarm on another side. And before, one has fired a volley
            at the defenses. [<del>The gabions</del>] The pioneers carry the
            boards to make a level ground or a platform of four fingers or half
            a foot thick, and one sets them into the earth. The platform is five
            or six <em>
                <del>cano</del>
            </em> feet larger than the wheels of the cannon on each side <em>
                <del>m</del>
            </em> if there is only one cannon. But if there are more, the
            platforms touch. The distance which is between the pieces is the
            width of two gabions (fol. <a
               href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/24v/f/24v/tl"><u>24v</u></a>).

    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>This text can be better understood by
        comparing it to an illustration inserted by Benedict Vassalieu in his
        manuscript <em>Treatise</em> offered to Duke Gaston d’Orléans in the
        1620s (<i><u>Fig. 10</u></i>). First of all, a good battery needed a
        leveled ground and a regular platform made of strong planks. These
        planks, brought by pioneers, had to be lightly inclined in the direction
        of the target so that it would be less tiring to put the cannons back in
        place after their recoil. To protect the pieces, a gunner had to build
        gabions, which were cylindrical wicker baskets filled with earth or
        stone. Gabions were made of willow or nut-tree branches. Trenches were
        also sometimes needed to set up or to visit a battery. Engineers’
        manuals of the time explain that these trenches had to zig-zag. In
        Vassalieu’s manuscript, the bullet-proof plank covering the gun-port,
        described by the author-practitioner, is visible. Buried powder
        magazines, well behind the pieces, are also visible, as well as the
        traditional gunners’ tools: rammers to push down the powder, as well as
        hay, ladles, sponges, and even buffers, which were thin cylindrical
        pieces of wood inserted between the ball and the black powder. Buffers
        were sometimes required for cannon because the shortness of the volley
        could not optimize the compression of the gas by the bullet alone.</p>

    <p>Most batteries shoot at fortifications from a short distance (about 200
        paces). The description of the diverse pieces already made this point.
        This means that the cannon, for instance, generally shot at “poynt
        blanke” with the barrel, however, bigger pieces like culverins or double
        cannon could shoot from a second line, and, in that case, aiming at the
        targets with a certain degree of precision was highly necessary.<a

    <blockquote>
        <p>Then a gunner loads it with a ladle, &amp; with the rammer which is
            at <em>
                <del>len</del>
            </em> the other end of the ladle, two men ram the powder as much as
            they can, in nine or ten pushes, until they find the powder to be
            hard &amp; well-compacted. Next, another puts hay or straw and the
            others ram a little. Another puts the ball and the hay-bearer puts
            in as much of it as before &amp; one rams a little. Some put wooden
            bungs but this runs the risk of making the piece burst. And where
            one has to fire many <del>cannon</del> shots, one would need many
            bungs, which would cost much to carry. Once the cannon is loaded, xx
            or xxv pioneers push it forward with bars, keeping to one side
            behind the gabions without taking off the board until the cannon
            reaches it. Once the cannon is in front, the gunner mounts it with
            the wedges which are at the back, taking the sight on each side and
            then in the middle. Then another who is nearby gives fire. Each
            <del>gunner</del> cannon needs 3 gunners: the loader, the one who
            aims, the one who gives fire. Sometimes, against a camp or into a
            breach, one shoots cartridges, made as you have elsewhere, or else
            one uses a basan full of flint stones, cart nails &amp; similar
            (fol. <a

    <p>Generally, for aiming, gunners needed no instruments apart from the
        cannon itself and a sight mounted at the breech end. However, to shoot
        at night (with no vision of the target), the author-practitioner admits
        that a quadrant was useful (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/21r/f/21r/tl"><u>21r</u></a>).
        The idea is to control the required elevation of the piece during the
        day or briefly at night, using fireworks, and then reproducing the shot
        even with no vision, thanks to a quadrant. The quadrant is a very basic
        instrument that had been described by Niccolò Tartaglia in the 1530s (<i><u>Fig. 11</u></i>).</p>

    <p>It is a set square made of two rulers assembled with a graduated
        quarter-circle plate and a plummet. William Bourne, an English master
        gunner and contemporary of the author-practitioner, explained how to use
        it:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Take a quadrant, with a rule fast thereunto, and put the rule into
            the mouth of the peece, and coyne the breech of the peece up and
            downe, untill the plummet hang at the corner of the Quadrant, and
            then shall the Concavitie of the peece, lye right with the Horyzon,
            neyther higher nor lower: then shoote off the peece against the
            butte: if the shotte bee under the marke, it is more then the right
            line, then you must bringe the peece neerer unto the butte, banke or
            marke: but if it be the just height of the marke, then remoove the
            peece farther off from the marke, and so removing the peece
            forwardes and backwardes, you shal finde the true right line of the
            peece.<a href="#fn35"

    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>If one knows that a target can be reached
        with a piece for a given elevation, one can then construct a table of
        ranges and elevations, and can precisely adjust the elevation of the
        piece, reading it on the quarter of a circle of the quadrant thanks to
        the plummet line.</p>
    <p>Often, battery fire was not sufficient to destroy a gate or a bastion,
        thus elite soldiers had to practice what they called an “escalade” and
        use explosives. The Toulouse text describes two kinds of these: the
        petard (curiously called <em>mortier</em> by the author-practitioner),
        and the buckram sausage. Both devices were more or less described by
        Hanzelet in his <em>Pyrotechnie</em>. Petards were commonly used to
        destroy doors or gates. Hanzelet explained that petards had to be made
        of red copper (rosette) with 1/10 of yellow copper but they could also
        be made of an alloy of lead and tin. Petards were filled with gunpowder
        and closed by a wooden buffer (in the manuscript, the shape of the
        buffer is that of a half-bullet). According to Hanzelet, petards were
        fixed on doors with some kind of fork (<i><u>Fig. 12</u></i>).</p>

    <p>According to the author-practitioner, the structure of petards is
        somewhat different: their shape was cylindrical and their length was
        about 40&nbsp;cm, with a content of 25 lbs. of gunpowder. The alloy
        proportion was also different: 4 quintals copper for 1 quintal of the
        kind of metal used for bells. To form a buffer, a half-bullet was
        covered with an iron cross. There was no fork to fix this device, but
        instead four drilling screws passing through four handles:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Such a petard is made which weighs three quintals, carries a
            cannonball flat on the side on which it must exit &amp; round on the
            inside of the cannon, as if it were a cannonball cut in half. It is
            two pans long. It is charged with xxv lb of powder for <del>at</del>
            it needs to be full up to the mouth &amp; it needs to burst. It does
            not have a different thickness at the breech than at the mouth &amp;
            is all of one piece. Its substance needs to be better than that of
            pieces, &amp; for 4 quintals of fine copper there ought to be only
            one quintal of metal in order that it holds the blast, &amp;,
            bursting with more force, has a greater effect. It is for putting
            against a door with a large iron cross in front of the ball, and
            <em>
                <del>s</del>
            </em>once loaded, it needs to be covered with a well-sewn thick
            canvas which should be anointed <em>
                <del>c</del>
            </em> all over with turpentine. It needs to have four handles, made
            while it is founded, for it is thus easier to place. The iron cross
            is joined to the mouth with the canvas with which it is covered.
            <del>To place it, it</del> The handles must be kept at the edge of
            its muzzle, as you see. To place it, one needs three or four iron
            pegs one pan long &amp; as thick as a finger which should have their
            point like a <del>wimble</del> gimlet, &amp; the entire leg as a
            screw, like an auger, &amp; a ring on the other end to turn them
            with a short stick which has play within the ring. And the pegs are
            placed in the door <del>but</del> not straight <del>but</del> for
            they would not have any strength, but at an angle as if you wanted
            to fix them toward the middle of the petard, and to do this, the
            hole of the handles needs to be quite large. In this way, the firing
            petard pushes the pegs along &amp; across into the door &amp; makes
            more of a breach (fol. <a
               href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/23r/f/23r/tl"><u>23r</u></a>).
        </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>“Sausages” made of fabric were used in complement with petards, probably
        to act as a kind of fuse to cross a ditch. They were sacks of linen
        moisted with turpentine oil, vinegar, and <em>aqua vitae</em>. In
        Hanzelet’s book, sausages are also used to fill up a casemate’s gun
        ports. The anonymous author-practitioner provides more details about the
        sausage’s making and its use:<a href="#fn36"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref36"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>take eight or nine canes of buckram strip or more if the ditch is
            larger, and let the strip be four or five fingers wide. Have it well
            sewn in such a way that it is like a gut through <del>l</del>which a
            stick as thick as a finger can pass. Fill it completely with good
            powder. When the sausage is full, dip it well in lightly, to wet the
            canvas &amp; not the powder, in two parts of vinegar &amp; of one of
            eau-de-vie. Next, let the said canvas dry well, and then one needs
            to join to the said sausage a long string or cord which should be
            two times longer than the sausage, &amp; one ought not to tighten it
            to the sausage but only to bind it to it at both ends &amp; to sew
            it on the sausage in a few places in the middle. Next one needs to
            anoint the entire sausage with very good turpentine, and at
            whichever end of it you wish to join to the touch-hole of the petard
            for giving fire, you can sew a or tightly attach a large strip of
            canvas one empan wide which should also be well soaked in
            turpentine; &amp; this strip must be split in the middle in order to
            wrap &amp; tie it around the petard, and one needs to attach it in
            such a way that <del>the touch-hole should be close to u mthe the
            </del> tip of the sausage, which should be open, should be joined to
            the touch-hole of the petard (fol. <a

    <h2 id="defending-a-place">Defending a Place</h2>
    <p>Other sections of Ms. Fr. 640 consider ways to defend a place. Artillery
        organs could be useful to defend a gate, but grenades and mortars as
        well as mutton skins filled with stones or sharp metal pieces were also
        used in defense:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>There is nothing that has a greater effect for the defense of a
            breach than petards placed at the entryway at the time of the
            assault. They carry a lot of ammunition. <em>
                <del>be</del>
            </em> One fills them with cart nails, large steel dice, bits of
            chain &amp; similar things. And when one senses that the enemies are
            close, one sets fire to all. Grenades, too, well-made and aptly
            thrown, cause great damage. And to make them worse, one puts
            coarsely <del>pestling</del> pestled glass either in the molds or in
            the crucible, when one wants to cast them; this worsens the wounds.
            The grenades ought not to be too brittle. But it is good that they
            be somewhat alloyed with the substance of the pieces in order that,
            holding the blast a little rather than breaking, they have more
            violence (Fol. <a
               href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/21v/f/21v/tl"><u>21v</u></a>).
        </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>The concept of shrapnel with all sorts of
        sharp objects, even pieces of broken glass, was, it seems, well
        understood here. Hanzelet, and many English or Italian authors, devote
        many pages to conceptions for similar grenades and fireworks. Some
        sixteenth-century grenades can be seen at the Army Museum in Brussels.
    </p>
    <h2 id="artillery-logistics">Artillery Logistics</h2>
    <p>Every piece of artillery depended upon extensive and complex logistics.
        First, there were the pieces necessary for fixing mounts and carriages.
        The wheels of cannons were incredibly complex pieces of technology,
        using different metallic elements.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><em>
                <del>P</del>
            </em> A <em>
                <del>ch</del>
            </em> cannon must not move unless it has two harnesses, be they of
            wood or iron. And to furnish the wheels, powder box, and other
            furniture of the cannon, one needs seven quintals and a half of
            iron&nbsp;(fol. <a
               href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/23r/f/23r/tl"><u>23r</u></a>).
        </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Second, there were the horses (up to 25 for double cannons in Ms. Fr.
        640, or 8 for a falcon). Thanks to Vassalieu’s treatise, we understand
        how horses were harnessed to the carriage. Some American film footage of
        the 1930s showing a mechanical harvester in a field gives us other
        clues.<a href="#fn37"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref37"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>37</sup></a> The drawing power of horses also
        served to draw carts and wagons carrying bullets, cartridges, powder
        barrels, individual weapons, and instruments. An idea of the size of
        ammunition trains can be gained from the fact that a double cannon could
        fire about thirty to forty times a day, and a falcon one hundred times.
    </p>
    <p>Each piece was served by at least one gunner and two gunner’s mates, and
        dozens of wheelwrights, carpenters, coopers, smiths, fletchers, and
        wagonwrights were also attached to the service of an artillery train
        (see Fig. 10 showing an artillery battery). Around a gun, there was
        commonly a master gunner, equipped with a lintstock to light the fuse,
        different mates using all sorts of tools (ladle, sponge, rammer, worm,
        etc.) to load the powder and the shot and to clean up the barrel, and
        some other mates to displace the piece with levers.</p>
    <p>Sappers were needed to enlarge narrow passages, to clear the pathways and
        to dig up trenches (see Fig. 10). According to the author-practitioner,
        100 <em>pionniers</em> (or “sappers”) were required for a single large
        cannon (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/24v/f/24v/tl"><u>24v</u></a>).
        This is confirmed by the numbers of sappers sent to the entrenched camps
        around Toulouse and salaried by the city.<a href="#fn38"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref38"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
    <p>Period account books also show that camps often possessed spare wheels
        because, despite their robustness, they constantly broke.<a href="#fn39"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref39"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>39</sup></a> The large number of horses can
        be seen in the account books of Toulouse’s “state of artillery” from
        1562 to 1615 (Archives municipales de Toulouse, CC and EE series), where
        the amount of money paid for horses and carts is truly bewildering: 7
        livres 10 sols by day and by horse. For instance, to provide ammunition
        for the Camp of Cornusson in 1577, 83 horses were needed, the cost of
        which was 622 livres (EE51).</p>
    <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The author-practitioner offers rare testimony about the materiality of
        artillery at the end of the sixteenth century that is comparable to
        Leonardo da&nbsp;Vinci’s testimony about Milan’s arsenal at the end of
        the fifteenth century. Although the author-practitioner was not himself
        a gun founder, he was obviously very familiar with the community. His
        detailed account raises the question of whether he would have been able
        to enter the space of the Arsenal, which was ordinarily subject to entry
        restrictions. He must have been acquainted with important people in the
        city government and perhaps with the “commissaire à l’artillerie” who in
        1595 was Jehan de&nbsp;Gout. The author-practitioner may not have had
        authorisation to enter the Arsenal, which could explain the absence of
        precise information on the actual founding of guns. Although his
        knowledge about the casting pits seems to be meager, he provides
        detailed information on alloys and drilling tools.</p>
    <p>On fols. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/17r/f/17r/tl"><u>17r</u></a>
        and <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/49r/f/49r/tl"><u>49r</u></a>,
        we also learn that the author-practitioner was in touch with master
        founders in the Toulouse Arsenal, the Poncet family. Nicolas, Jean, and
        Étienne were at that time founders in Toulouse, and Étienne had the
        title of gunner.<a href="#fn40"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref40"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>40</sup></a> Along with many other artisans,
        the Poncet lived near the river, in the capitoulat “la Daurade,” close
        to the grounds of an abbey (<i><u>Fig. 14</u></i>).<a href="#fn41"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref41"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>41</sup></a> In the range of his knowledge
        and his interest in casting and weaponry, the author-practitioner
        resembles an artisan like Barthélémy Fraysse who was a cannon founder
        and a gunner, and participated in siege warfare.<a href="#fn42"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref42"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>42</sup></a> Besides contact with founders,
        it would appear that the author-practitioner was on rather friendly
        terms with the military. The interest in weaponry may even suggest that
        the author-practitioner was involved in the political life of Toulouse,
        perhaps a Catholic concerned with the fight against the heretics.</p>
