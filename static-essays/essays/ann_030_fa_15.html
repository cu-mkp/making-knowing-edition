        <div>
            <p>This essay explores three recipes in Ms. Fr. 640 (on fols. <a

                casts of flowers more lifelike. The author-practitioner blends
                verdigris with an organic yellow lake pigment known as stil de
                grain yellow or <em>scudegrun</em>, and my reconstruction
                explores the different plant-based dyes and substrates he used
                for the yellow pigment. The author-practitioner’s experiments
                suggest a need for both precision and flexibility when imitating
                nature in the workshop: while the recipes can be specific about
                ingredients and ways to assess the naturalism of the pigment’s
                color, they also leave important components such as ingredient
                quantities and pigment application techniques up to a maker’s
                “judgment &amp; discretion” (fol. 158v).</p>

    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
    <p>This essay explores the instructions for “Colors for green leaves” on
        fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/158v/f/158v/tl"><u>158v</u></a>
        in the context of other pigment making instructions, in particular two
        entries on stil de grain yellow (<em>scudegrun</em>) on fols. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/10r/f/10r/tl"><u>10r</u></a>
        and <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/63v/f/63v/tl"><u>63v</u></a>.
        At first glance, these recipes seem like straightforward suggestions for
        expanding the color palette. Careful reading and consideration, however,
        shows us that the author-practitioner was interested in creating
        naturalistic works, and relied on a range of materials and color-making
        techniques to produce the desired visual effects. Fol. 158v is primarily
        about modifying green paint (made with verdigris) because, as the
        author-practitioner states, verdigris “has depth” and is “too dark” for
        lifelike plants. To make suitable colors, he suggests mixing verdigris
        with yellow. Yellow has long played a role in making green pigments. As
        Mary P. Merrifield explains,</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>it was generally considered that mixed green, composed of blue and
            yellow, was more permanent than any of the before-mentioned green
            pigments. They were frequently compounded of ultramarine and
            orpiment, of azzurro della magna and giallolino, of indigo and
            orpiment, and of one of the mineral blues with a yellow lake.<a
               href="#fn1"
               class="footnote-ref"
               id="fnref1"
               role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>In Ms. Fr. 640, the author-practitioner did not mix yellow with blue but
        instead used a few specific yellow pigments—stil de grain yellow, yellow
        ocher, and massicot—to broaden the range of green hues available to him.
        The variety of options for yellow contrasts with the consistency with
        which verdigris is used for green throughout the rest of the manuscript.
    </p>
    <p>Yellow had long been a problem for artisans because the plant-based dyes
        and pigments that are nontoxic also tend to be unstable and prone to
        fading. While the author-practitioner does not appear to have invented
        new ways of deriving yellow pigment (his recipes are consistent with
        those in manuscripts dating to before and after Ms. Fr. 640, as
        discussed in this essay), he does apply these yellows and greens to
        painting metal—a technique that few artisans discuss. My experiments
        focused on the various types of yellow the author-practitioner used to
        modify green, also referring to fols. 10r and 63v (both titled
        “<em>Scudegrun</em>”), and how this range of yellow pigments might
        produce different visual effects when painted on cast metal objects.
        These recipes lead us to consider the following question: how do the
        qualities and characteristics of these materials produce different
        yellows? For the yellow lakes called <em>scudegrun</em>, how do
        different substrates (ceruse and chalk mentioned by the
        author-practitioner, powdered eggshell in contemporaneous manuscripts)
        alter the pigment? The variety in yellows—and even in the substrates and
        dye sources for yellow lakes—hints at the range of materials the
        author-practitioner was able to draw on in his permutations of
        color-making processes. For example, on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/10r/f/10r/tl"><u>10r</u></a>,
        he uses “chalk, or better yet ceruse” as the substrate for his yellow
        lake. His phrasing suggests a noted difference between the two materials
        and the superiority of the ceruse. However, both fols. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/10r/f/10r/tl"><u>10r</u></a>
        and <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/63v/f/63v/tl"><u>63v</u></a>
        have recipes entitled “<em>Scudegrun</em>” (“Stil de grain yellow”)
        which make use of different plant sources (weld and broom flower), but
        the author does not suggest they are interchangeable, nor does he
        express a preference. While we cannot know for certain the
        author-practitioner’s imaginary of materials, my examination of this
        recipe through reconstruction provides a better understanding of the
        flexibility of the recipes, and how the author-practitioner modified
        them (using his judgment and experience) to suit specific needs.</p>
    <h2 id="history-of-yellow-and-ms.-fr.-640">History of Yellow and Ms. Fr. 640
    </h2>
    <p>Perhaps the difficulties artisans experienced with the fugitive
        instability of yellows led to experiments, such as those in Ms. Fr. 640,
        with a variety of materials to try to achieve a stable color. Pigments,
        composed of small particles varying from .01 to 1 micron, are “pure
        colors in powder form, which must be suspended in a medium in which they
        are insoluble (such as oil) in order to make paint.”<a href="#fn2"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref2"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> The author-practitioner used
        earth pigments (ochers), lead-based pigments (massicot, ceruse), as well
        as lakes (stil de grain yellow) to make yellow paints.<a href="#fn3"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref3"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> While the recipe on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/158v/f/158v/tl"><u>158v</u></a>
        does not specify how these paints might be used, it is grouped with
        recipes that refer to mold making and casting, which suggests that the
        author-practitioner was perhaps looking for ways to color cast metals.
        He specifically instructed practitioners to paint in oil, “because
        distemper colors have no hold.” Also, he cautioned practitioners to
        “layer it transparently, so as not to cover the lines of the work.”
        These details in his instruction indicate that the paint is meant to be
        overlaid on a material warranting special precautions. The use of
        specific pigments for different purposes is typical of the
        author-practitioner’s instructions. For example, an entry on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/62r/f/62r/tl"><u>62r</u></a>
        titled “Ocher” simply states “it is put for faces, hair, skulls, and
        rocks.” In “Shadows,” on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/63r/f/63r/tl"><u>63r</u></a>,
        he notes that “German painters make their shadows on flesh color of men
        with ground jet, stil de grain yellow &amp; ocher.”<a href="#fn4"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref4"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> These recipes give specific
        instances in which certain types of yellow are appropriate for achieving
        a sense of realism in painting, even noting examples where a technique
        has been used to good effect (as with the “German painters”).</p>
    <p>On fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/158v/f/158v/tl"><u>158v</u></a>,
        the author-practitioner apparently seeks to expand his green palette.
        According to Daniel V. Thompson, one of the “chief functions [of yellow]
        was to modify the qualities of greens and, to a lesser extent, of reds,”
        meaning the author-practitioner was likely recording a commonly
        practiced technique.<a href="#fn5"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref5"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> In “Colors for green leaves” on
        fol. 158v, however, he deliberately instructs practitioners to “put the
        color on the natural flower or leaf to see whether it comes close.” This
        recipe shows special attention to naturalistic effects, related to his
        interest in casting lifelike plants and creatures. The
        author-practitioner intends to use yellows to brighten “dark” verdigris
        and evoke a more lifelike effect in his cast plants.<a href="#fn6"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref6"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
    <p>A number of well-known sources of yellow pigment are not included among
        the manuscript’s paint recipes. While the author-practitioner mentions
        marigold and saffron (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/38r/f/38r/tl"><u>38r</u></a>),
        he does not suggest that they can be used for dyes or pigments. Perhaps
        this is because French saffron was not considered good quality, as is
        noted as early as the fourteenth century in the art technical writing of
        Petrus de S. Audemar from the north of France. The best kind—known as
        corsicos—was brought from Sicily, making it more expensive and less
        practical to use in bulk.<a href="#fn7"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref7"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> <em>Terra merita</em> (turmeric)
        is mentioned in Ms. Fr. 640 in a recipe for imitation gold (for painting
        over silver foil), among others, but it is never used as a yellow paint
        on its own.<a href="#fn8"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref8"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> Lastly, the author-practitioner
        only refers to orpiment (arsenic trisulfide, from the Latin
        <em>auripigmentum</em>) once, although its widespread use dates to Old
        Kingdom Egypt (2700–2200 BCE) and was present in medieval Europe.<a
           href="#fn9"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref9"

           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/99v/f/99v/tl"><u>99v</u></a>,
        he uses it as a substitute for gold to gild a frame. Perhaps he does not
        use this popular pigment for painting because by the Middle Ages,
        artisans had begun to move away from arsenic-based yellows like orpiment
        to lead-tin yellows.<a href="#fn10"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref10"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> It is also possible that he was
        aware that orpiment was unsuitable for modifying green tones because its
        sulfur component could react with the copper in verdigris.<a

           id="fnref11"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> The author-practitioner’s
        selective treatment indicates that the type of yellow pigment mattered:

    <h2 id="lake-pigments">Lake Pigments</h2>
    <p>The author-practitioner suggests using stil de grain yellow, a lake
        pigment. Since the time of Pliny the Elder, who was one of the earliest
        in antiquity to write about lake pigments, artists had expanded beyond
        limited mineral pigments, experimenting with vegetable- and animal-based
        dyes to make lakes.<a href="#fn12"

           id="fnref12"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> To make a lake, artists
        typically take a white mineral powder (usually clay, aluminum, or

            santo</em> (a yellow lake made from weld) in the Paduan Manuscript,
        a codex likely written in the mid-seventeenth century, suggests using
        “the berries of buckthorn towards the end of the month of August,” while
        another <em>giallo santo</em> recipe in the eighteenth-century color
        manual <em>Nuovo Plico</em> calls for “the flowers of the Erba Lizza,
        Barbi de Becco (yellow goat’s beard).”<a href="#fn16"

        schijtgeel” as well as “scudegrun” might relate to the pharmacological
        properties of the <em>Rhamnus</em> (buckthorn) berry, it also refers to

        Mayerne Manuscript (compiled 1620–1646) calls for “Dutch pink” (rendered
        as <em>schüttgrün</em> in Ernst Berger’s 1901 German translation) mixed
        with linseed oil and “turpentine varnish and oil of turpentine” for a
        “green varnish, like emerald.”<a href="#fn18"

        term for yellow lakes. In Ms. Fr. 640, there are two separate recipes

            luteola</em>) and dyer’s broom (<em>Genista tinctoria</em>) are
        plants commonly used for dyeing fabrics yellow, producing “rather acid
        lemon to brownish-yellow lake pigments.”<a href="#fn19"

    <h2 id="reconstruction">Reconstruction</h2>
    <p>Drawing information about proportions of ingredients from the seventh
        chapter of the so-called Bolognese Manuscript (dated to the fifteenth
        century), which mostly deals with pigment-making, I adapted the
        following recipe for the reconstruction:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>To make good and fine arzica Take 1 lb of weld, which the dyers use,
            cut it very fine, then put it into a glazed or tinned base, and add
            it to enough water to cover the herb. Make it boil until the water
            is half wasted, and if there is not enough water add a sufficient
            quantity and no more; then take 2 oz. travertine (q.v.) finely
            ground, or 2 oz. white lead, and a half oz. of roche alum ground
            very fine, then put all these things together a little at a time to
            boil in the vase directly, before the water cools, and stir the
            water continually, remove the vessel from the fire, and when nearly
            dry, pour off the water. Then take a new brick hollow in the middle,

        in Ms. Fr. 640, this recipe indicates that weld is a suitable plant base
        for making this pigment. The original Italian term for weld in the
        Bolognese Manuscript is <em>gualda</em>, a Spanish and Portuguese term
        that is also etymologically similar to the author-practitioner’s use of

    <p>Similar yellow lake recipes consistently recommend chalk, white lead, or
        powdered eggshell as a substrate. Like Ms. Fr. 640, the Bolognese
        Manuscript recipe also suggests that travertine (a chalk-like mineral)
        and white lead can be used interchangeably. White lead as a substrate is
        mentioned in the Paduan Manuscript, which explains that “yellow is made
        with white lead and gialdo santo.”<a href="#fn21"

    <p>The substrate made an obvious difference to the color tone of the weld
        pigments. The finely powdered chalk painted the most smoothly and
        produced the brightest yellow. The eggshell produced a darker yellow,
        but it was difficult to grind finely. In a recipe for rose-colored lake
        pigments from the Jehan le Begue manuscript, compiled in the fifteenth
        century, the author instructs the reader to “take egg-shells, pound them
        well, then grind them fine on a porphyry slab.”<a href="#fn28"

        “pound” and “grind,” with the second step meant to refine the substrate.
        We re-ground the dyed eggshell and realized that a longer grinding time
        made the pigment fine enough to paint smoothly, leaving fewer large
        particles (<i><u>Fig. 8</u></i>). This showed us that workshop tasks
        like pigment making were time-consuming and required patience and
        muscular strength but seems tasks that might easily be delegated to
        apprentices or assistants. In Joannes Stradanus’s late sixteenth-century

    <p>At the beginning of the fourteenth century, a new yellow derived from tin
        appeared in northern Europe and was known in Flanders as
        <em>masticote</em>. This lead-tin oxide “had the brightness of orpiment
        but was chemically neutral with regard to other pigments (some
        lead-based paints turn other colors gray) and only mildly toxic.”<a
           href="#fn35"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref35"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>35</sup></a> Cennini also discusses a color
        called <em>giallorino</em>, annotated as massicot, which is lighter than
        ocher and “is a very beautiful yellow colour. And lovely greenery and
        grass colour is made from this pigment with other mixtures.”<a
           href="#fn36"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref36"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>36</sup></a> Thompson believes that “probably
        most of the references to giallorino in medieval writings mean massicot,
        a yellow oxide of lead, prepared in the Middle Ages by gentle roasting
        of orange lead as an intermediate product in the preparation of white
        lead.”<a href="#fn37"

        way to paint trees and grasses and greenery in fresco and in secco,”
        Cennini tells artisans to “make a green with giallorino which should be
        a bit lighter and do some leaves […] Then touch in the lighter bits on
        the crests just with giallorino and you will see the reliefs on the
        trees and on the greenery.”<a href="#fn38"

        painting plants was common practice and the author-practitioner of Ms.
        Fr. 640 adapted it to color metal casts in a lifelike way.</p>
    <p>Also evident in contemporaneous recipes is the range of methods artists
        used for making these pigments. In the Paduan Manuscript, the author
        includes a recipe for “straw” color: “take lead yellow (massicot), wash
        it with a very strong and clean lye, then decant the lye, and distemper
        with the colour with parchment glue.”<a href="#fn39"

           role="doc-noteref"><sup>39</sup></a> Unlike Cennini, who says that
        the massicot “needs to be ground […] with clear water” and is good with
        temperas, the Paduan manuscript suggests lye and parchment glue
        binder.<a href="#fn40"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref40"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>40</sup></a> It seems clear that
        practitioners were adjusting the ingredients, suspension media, and
        binders to suit the material onto which they applied the paint. For
        example, while mixing pigments with water and tempera might be good for
        fresco painting, oil would be a more suitable medium for metal casts.
    </p>
    <p>When I mixed ready-made massicot with linseed oil, it turned into a pale
        yellow paint. Like the two French ochers, the Kremer massicot pigment
        was already finely ground and needed only a few minutes of being worked
        with the muller to become usable (<i><u>Fig. 12</u></i>). When painted,
        the massicot is actually very thin, pale, and translucent, much more so
        than the ocher oil paints. When combined with the verdigris, it makes a
        sunny bright green that is translucent and pale in tone (<i><u>Fig.
                13</u></i>). I also tested the massicot in combination with
        minium, or red lead paint, because the author-practitioner tells us that
        this would be a suitable color for marigolds (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/158v/f/158v/tl"><u>158v</u></a>):
        “for marigold flowers, lightly ground minium for some, &amp; for others
        which are more yellowish, a bit of massicot with it” (<i><u>Fig.
                14</u></i>). The ground minium was a bright, neon red that
        turned into a light orange when mixed with the massicot. The
        author-practitioner could blend these two colors together to
        convincingly imitate the marigold colors, especially since the mixed
        pigments darkened as they dried.</p>

        oil paint dry more quickly.<a href="#fn41"

        that “lead white &amp; massicot are the most desiccative, nevertheless
        they need a good two days.” The color of massicot, although also based
        on white lead, is very different from that deriving from the weld
        pigment precipitated onto white lead. If the author-practitioner wanted
        a bright-looking yellow, he might have considered massicot superior to
        weld on ceruse because of ceruse’s tendency to turn gray. In the final
        view of all the painted and dried pigments, each yellow has a distinct
        hue and tone, and it modifies the green, giving the author-practitioner
        an expanded palette with which to work (<i><u>Fig. 15</u></i>).</p>

    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>While this method of cold painting might
        be convincing at a distance, it is inferior in appearance to other
        methods of coloring metal, such as with vitreous enamel, a technique
        that existed in the sixteenth century. Sixteenth-century metalworking
        experts Vannoccio Biringuccio and Benvenuto Cellini both wrote about
        firing enamel on metal. Biringuccio considered enameling a difficult
        art, stating, “there are few in our regions who can perform this well
        because they are dependent on enamels and on the thing they wish to
        enamel, for each kind of gold, silver, or copper requires enamel
        harmonious to its nature, else it does not respond.”<a href="#fn44"

           id="fnref44"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>44</sup></a></p>
    <p>Another sixteenth-century method for coloring metal casts was cold
        enameling—a misleading term since the technique actually refers to paint
        that is applied directly to the metal rather than a vitreous enamel
        applied through heat. Neither Biringuccio nor Cellini wrote about “cold
        enameling,” which was used as an alternative to traditional enameling.<a

        coloring metal is less durable than fire enameling, a number of examples
        still survive in museums. Tamar Davidowitz, who has written extensively
        on the surface paint on Jamnitzer’s Merkel table piece in the
        Rijksmuseum, notes that paint is often found with silver substrates
        because silver, unlike gold or copper, “does not diminish the brightness
        of translucent paints.”<a href="#fn46"

           id="fnref46"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>46</sup></a> Not only was enameling a
        difficult skill, as Biringuccio mentions, but paint was also a cheaper
        alternative that could be used on objects that were difficult to enamel
        in a traditional way. In addition, very thin casts, or those with a low
        melting point, could easily melt during the enamel firing, making cold
        painting more suitable.<a href="#fn47"

        different shades of green and yellow, perhaps indicating that the paint
        was layered to achieve opacity and an even tone as well as a more
        naturalistic appearance. However, on both our painted metal cast and

    <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The challenge of finding a light-fast, suitable yellow encouraged
        artisans to experiment with a broad range of materials and methods: each
        yellow pigment produced a paint with very different qualities of
        texture, opacity, and color. While we found it frustrating to work with
        the author-practitioner’s inexact language, by following his
        instructions as closely as possible, we were able to better understand
        his methods of measuring and judging results and to suggest ways in
        which his written records reflected his embodied knowledge. For example,
        because he was not specific about how to mix the paints, we had to rely
        on our own experience and understanding of color to make a suitable
        shade of green to approximate living plants. In addition, with the wide
        regional variation in materials, extremely precise instructions might
        not result in the desired effect in any case. We realized that his
        inexactness was not simply an omission. On fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/158v/f/158v/tl"><u>158v</u></a>
        the author-practitioner instructs us to use our “judgment &amp;
        discretion” when applying the colors, showing an understanding of the
        role of variety in available materials, personal preference, and
        workshop variability in craftwork. What the author-practitioner offers
        instead of standardized materials and modern quantitative rigor is a set
        of guidelines. As in other color making recipes, there is an expectation
        that other practitioners will adjust and experiment, tailoring the
        recipe to their own needs.</p>
    <p>Our experiments focused on the issues surrounding the yellows that the
        author-practitioner found suitable for mixing with green and for
        painting on metal. His suggestion to use the charcoal of peach pits or
        the “black of ox foot bone” to darken the green warrants further
        exploration. In addition, the technique of cold painting on metal also
        merits further study. Further scientific analysis could show the
        correlation between instructions in Ms. Fr. 640 and extant artworks. For
        example, Davidowitz was unable to explain the presence of chalk in the
        yellow paint, but perhaps her results suggest that the yellow was a lake
        pigment precipitated onto chalk, as the author-practitioner of Ms. Fr.
        640 recommended.<a href="#fn48"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref48"

        invent new techniques for pigments (nor for the various methods he uses
        to make yellow). However, as one of the few surviving texts that records
        techniques of painting on metal, his recipes demonstrate that
        traditional pigment making practices could be adapted to a new medium.
        As other research essays have pointed out, this kind of versatility and
        experimentation based on practice and experience was valued in early
        modern artisanal workshops.<a href="#fn49"

                    the author-practitioner specifies different colored shadows
                    for men and women: men’s shadows should be made from a more
                    yellowish-black color while women’s shadows should be made
                    from a greenish-black, perhaps in relation to theories about
                    the difference in men’s and women’s humours. See Cleo Nisse,
