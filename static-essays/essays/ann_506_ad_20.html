            <p>Several entries mention cuttlefish bone in Ms. Fr. 640: some use
                the powder of cuttlefish bones as a method of erasing (fol.
                15v), others employ calcined cuttlefish powder as a sand for
                making molds (fol. 49r), but most of these entries make use of
                the bone as a rapidly-produced mold into which metals are cast,
                including fols. <a

                These entries provide a wealth of information on preparing the
                bones for molding, impressing models into them, and, finally,
                casting metals into them. They also contain descriptions of
                techniques by which an artisan could test the temperature of
                molten metal before casting. These entries particularly
                highlight the sensory and bodily knowledge needed by an artisan.
                We learned through experience the value of this knowledge in the
                course of our reconstructions.</p>

    <p>Several entries mention cuttlefish bone in Ms. Fr. 640: some use the
        powder of cuttlefish bones for erasing writing on tablets (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/15v/f/15v/tl"><u>15v</u></a>),
        others employ calcined cuttlefish powder as a sand for making molds
        (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/49v/f/49v/tl"><u>49r</u></a>),
        but most of them make use of the bone as a rapidly produced mold into
        which metals are cast (fols. <a

        and <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/157r/f/157r/tl"><u>157r</u></a>).
        These entries give a wealth of detail on the processes of preparing the
        bones for molding, including how to flatten and sand off the bones, how
        to make them “imbibe” willow charcoal so they will release the model and
        then the cast, how to dry them, and how to bind the mold to prepare it
        for casting. The entries devote much space to the various techniques of
        impressing the model into the cuttlefish “marrow,” as the
        author-practitioner calls the soft spongy side of the cuttlefish float
        bone. He also notes that the “shell which holds the marrow, once
        calcined, is good for making sand” for molds (fol. 72v). In addition, “A
        means of goldsmiths for molding hollow,” on fol. 157r contains an
        intriguing method of using cuttlefish bones to make a hollow casting:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>They mold in two cuttlefish bones their animal or other work that
            they have either already made or modeled in wax &amp; cast in lead.
            Once it is well imprinted in the two cuttlefish bones, they place
            between these two bones a paper, &amp; join the bones &amp; cast.
            The work comes out split in half. And then, with <em>
                <del>ch</del>
            </em> a <em>chaple</em> [a type of chisel], they hollow out as
            finely as they please the two halves cast in gold or silver, and
            then solder or braze them.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>In addition to these techniques of making the mold from the cuttlefish
        bone, the author-practitioner notes that lead and tin are well suited to
        being cast into cuttlefish bone, and, while silver and gold can also be
        cast into them, the cast will not come out as “neat,” by which the
        author-practitioner means that the metal cast will not contain the
        desired sharp, crisp details.</p>
    <p>Perhaps most interesting, the entries on fols. 91r–v and 139r describe a
        “paper test” to determine whether the molten metal is at the right
        temperature to be poured into the mold and is not too hot (which will
        result both in a poor metal surface and a burnt mold). The “paper test”
        that the author-practitioner elaborates in these recipes is just one of
        the tricks of the metalworker’s trade, which, like the “squeeze test” to
        measure the readiness of molding sand to be packed into a mold, formed
        essential parts of sensory and bodily training for an artisan in a
        period before instruments took over the measurement of temperature and
        humidity.<a href="#fn1"

    <p>No other artisanal manual we consulted provided anything like the level
        of detail on the use of cuttlefish bones for casting that is contained
        in Ms. Fr. 640, perhaps because this was a well known and commonly used
        technique (and is still used by goldsmiths today). Cennino Cennini does
        not discuss the process, but mentions “cuttle such as the goldsmiths use
        for casting.”<a href="#fn2"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref2"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> Likewise, Vannoccio Biringuccio
        makes a passing reference to cuttlebone casting in the
        <em>Pirotechnia</em>, implying that it is a quick method of making
        molds: “To save time, they cast all metals in cuttlebone, having first
        molded in halves the object they are to make.”<a href="#fn3"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref3"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> It would seem that the technique
        was so familiar to these writers that they did not see the value of
        describing it. Why, in contrast to these other authors of practical
        texts, did the author-practitioner believe a detailed description of
        cuttlefish mold making and casting was worth such a large amount of
        space and effort?</p>
    <p>Our essay leaves this intriguing question for further research, and
        instead explores the various bodily techniques the author-practitioner
        specifies for impressing the object into the mold (with hands, knees, or
        feet), and reconstructs the author-practitioner’s “paper test” for
        determining the heat of metals.</p>

    <h3 id="cuttlefish-bones">Cuttlefish Bones</h3>
    <p>We sourced cuttlefish bones from Petco, where they are sold for
        parakeets.<a href="#fn4"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref4"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> The first step was to prepare the
        bones to serve as molds. After discussing different metals to cast into
        cuttlefish molds, the author-practitioner notes on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/145r/f/145r/tl"><u>145r</u></a>
        that</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>before casting in them [the cuttlefish molds], dry them, &amp;
            especially for gold, which does not want humidity. You will
            recognize that they are dry enough when, after having brought the
            inside &amp; the imprint of these to the fire, they cry &amp;
            crackle once brought near the ear.</p>

           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/91r/f/91r/tl"><u>91r</u></a>
        also admonishes the reader to “Guard against keeping them in a damp
        place, for they are very prone to getting moist [...]. Before casting,
        heat the bones in order to make them lose only the coldness &amp;
        dampness.” Although we did not have access to a fire, we held the
        cuttlefish bones over an electric hotplate burner using a thin mesh
        strainer (<i><u>Fig. 1</u></i>). Much to our delight, the bones emitted
        a noise much like a “cry &amp; crackle” after a few minutes.</p>

    <p>On fols. 145r and 91r, the author-practitioner gives instructions about
        the part of the bone into which the model should be impressed:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>usually one cuts the bone in the middle, and the dullest part and
            that which does not have any half circles is the most delicate and
            smoothest for molding, &amp; thus one always imprints there the
            principal [i.e., the model or pattern] (fol. 145r)</p>
        <p>***</p>
        <p>the bone marrow toward the tail is more delicate &amp; does have not
            as many stripes &amp; molds more cleanly (fol. 91r).</p>

    <p>We were unsure whether we should cut the bone in half along its length,
        width, or depth (<i><u>Fig. 3</u></i>). We decided it made the
        most sense in terms of the function of the mold to bisect along the
        width, and we used a jeweler’s saw to cut the bones (<i><u>Fig. 4</u></i>). This was exceptionally slow going as the bones were brittle and
        broke easily. It became easier with successive attempts as we became
        more familiar with the resistance of the material and the handling of
        the saw. We cut a series of molds between one and three inches in height
        (using one half of each cuttlefish bone for the front and back of each
        mold), and we made them flat on the ends so they could rest without
        being held during the pouring. We then sanded the bones to make them
        flat by rubbing the marrow side of the cuttlefish bone against a wooden
        board (<i><u>Fig. 5</u></i>), following instructions on fols. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/145r/f/145r/tl"><u>145r</u></a>
        and <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/91r/f/91r/tl"><u>91r</u></a>:
        “One smooths &amp; flattens these two halves on some smooth wood” (fol.
        145r) and “on a hooked roof tile, quite dry &amp; quite smoothed &amp;
        covered with pulverized willow charcoal, rub &amp; smooth the two halves
        of the bones” (fol. 91r). We did not smooth our bones with charcoal,
        which was meant to cause the mold to “release well” from the cast
        object, but, instead, applied it later before binding the two halves of
        the mold together. We only realized after doing this that the
        author-practitioner advises applying charcoal <em>before</em> making the
        impression so that the model will also release well (fol. 145r).</p>

    <p>Cuttlefish bones proved to be an easy surface in which to make an
        impression, but, as in sawing them, we failed at our first try because
        the material is very brittle. As we came to expect—and work with—the
        resistance of the bone, however, we were able to create a mold of a ring
        and a cross pendant by pressing each firmly into the bone (<i><u>Fig. 6</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 7</u></i>).<a href="#fn5"

    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>This makes it sound easier than it was; in
        fact, it took extensive experimentation. The author-practitioner gives
        three different methods of pressing the model (or “principal,” as he
        calls it), which in this case is a medal, into the mold:</p>
    <blockquote>

            make it better, put on the medal something flat &amp; smooth, or
            some large square file<del>e</del>, &amp; press with this, for you

    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>He notes that one must be mindful to work
        slowly and carefully, or, as he puts it “Moule aussy a laise” (“mold at
        your ease” or “at your leisure”), and press the model in the two halves
        “two or three times, until you see that it is pressed quite tightly
        together &amp; well imprinted” (fol. 145r).</p>
    <p>We tried pressing with our fingers, and it indeed proved difficult to
        apply pressure evenly, then we tried pressing with our bare foot, per
        the recipe’s instructions, but broke several molds in the process,
        because it was difficult to be precise in the pressure we applied. The
        most successful method was the third alternative given by the
        author-practitioner, and consisted of placing our fingers on one side of
        the mold, then sandwiching the model between the two halves of the bone,
        then sitting down in a chair, pressing our palms around the mold at the
        same time we were pressing our hands between our knees, which made
        possible a strong and even pressure, while using our hands as guides and
        moderators of the pressure. Our experience was confirmed by later
        cohorts of students.<a href="#fn6"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref6"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> We found that this method quickly
        became second nature, and we were soon able to relatively effortlessly

    <h3 id="the-mold">The Mold</h3>
    <p>We then used a razor blade to cut a funnel-shaped gate (or pouring cup)
        in the top of the mold for the metal to enter, and three or four small
        air vents on one side of the mold (<i><u>Fig. 8</u></i>). We fastened
        the two halves of the mold together by binding them tightly with
        galvanized steel binding wire (<i><u>Fig. 9</u></i>), following the
        instructions to “join them &amp; lute the joints with a little clay,
        &amp; make it dry lightly by the fire” (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/145r/f/145r/tl"><u>145r</u></a>).
        We did not, however, attempt to lute the joints of the mold with clay
        because we were afraid that the clay would not be fully dry when we
        poured the gold, which could, as the author-practitioner notes on fol.
        <a

        experience during our skill-building exercises that dampness in the mold
        was dangerous.<a href="#fn7"

        Metals: The Paper Test</h3>
    <p>The author-practitioner is very concerned that the 1:1 tin-lead alloy he
        recommends for cuttlefish bone casting not get overheated, and he
        provides instructions for a test of the metal’s temperature: on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/91r/f/91r/tl"><u>91r</u></a>,
        he mentions that one should “cast moderately hot, which you will know
        when the bone is about to change its good whiteness. But when it is too
        hot, it turns the bone very red.” On fols. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/139r/f/139r/tl"><u>139r</u></a>
        and <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/145r/f/145r/tl"><u>145r</u></a>,
        he lays out what the Making and Knowing Project came to call “the paper
        test”:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>One ought not to cast either tin or lead too hot in it, for it would
            burn the bone &amp; come out lumpy. And to know when it is at a good
            heat, dip a little piece of twisted paper into it. If it blackens it
            without lighting, it is at a good heat. But if it burns it &amp;
            catches fire there, it is too hot (fol. 145r).</p>
        <p>***</p>
        <p>Note that if you want to cast them [an alloy of tin and lead] in
            cuttlefish bone, they ought not to be very hot because they will
            burn the cuttlefish bone. Test for this effect with paper. If it
            turns the paper red, it is enough, it is good to cast, but if it
            blackens the paper, it is too hot (fol. 139r) [<i><u>Fig. 13</u></i>].</p>

        practitioner that they are ready. All metals give a distinctive sign:

    <p>Our tin trials were immediately successful. After the cuttlefish mold had
        cooled, we were able to pop the tin ring directly out of the mold in one
        piece, without damaging the mold at all. The melting point of tin is so
        low that the mold was not even slightly discolored, nor damaged in any
        way (<i><u>Fig. 14</u></i>). We understood experientially what the
        author-practitioner meant for a cast to “come out neatly.” In fact, the
        mold was so perfectly intact that we were able to cast an identical ring
        in the same mold (<i><u>Fig. 15</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 16</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 17</u></i>).</p>

    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>In contrast to our tin casting, however,
        the gold casting burned the mold entirely and destroyed it for further
        use. This is not surprising because the melting point of gold (1948°F)
        is nearly four times higher than the melting point of tin (449.5°F). The
        molten gold not only burned and blackened the cuttlefish bone, but also,
        when the gold casting was removed, the mold flaked and crumbled, and
        parts of the mold came away attached to the casting (<i><u>Fig. 22</u></i>). As the author-practitioner had predicted, gold did not come out
        neatly from this mold.</p>

    <p>We next made three attempts at pouring gold into the ring mold, but it
        was difficult to keep both the gold and the crucible hot enough to
        ensure that the gold remained liquid, and at the same time to pour
        quickly enough to make the gold run smoothly into the mold. We thus made
        two attempts and could not get the gold to flow through the whole mold (<i><u>Fig. 23</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 24</u></i>). Our expert practitioner
        consultant, Dr. Boyd, suggested that we enlarge our pouring cup so that
        we could pour more quickly and accurately. We also expanded the bottom
        of the funnel on each side so the gold would be able to flow more easily
        in both directions around the ring. After a second try using these
        techniques, we were finally able to create a successful casting of the
        ring in gold (<i><u>Fig. 25</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 26</u></i>).</p>

    <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>It became obvious to us in the course of our reconstruction why the
        author-practitioner preferred using cuttlefish bone for casting metals
        like tin and lead that have lower melting points, for the cuttlefish
        bone withstood these metals very well, and it was possible to create
        several castings from the same mold. Gold, on the other hand, as he had
        predicted, destroyed the mold with its heat and resulted in a less
        “neat” cast. That cuttlefish bone molds were nevertheless used by
        sixteenth-century goldsmiths for casting silver (melting point 1763°F)
        is evident from extant objects (<i><u>Fig. 27</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 28</u></i>).</p>

    <p>Our reconstruction also proved the effectiveness of the
        author-practitioner’s techniques for making molds from cuttlefish bones,
        and it confirmed his close observation of materials. We came to
        understand the importance of the material signs mentioned by the
        author-practitioner, to which an artisan had to be attuned. Our
        skepticism about instructions that at first reading seemed absurd—bones
        that “cry &amp; crackle” and impressing molds with our knees—gave way
        when we learned from experience that these sensory and bodily techniques
        were in fact extremely useful and effective.</p>
