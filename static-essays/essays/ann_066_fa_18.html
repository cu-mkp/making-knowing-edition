        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <div>
            <p>A significant proportion of the entries in Ms. Fr. 640 describe
                the cultivation of plants and animals. Might this indicate a
                conceptual link between the manuscript and the genre of the
                household manual? This essay investigates Charles Estienne’s
                <em>La maison rustique</em> (1564)<em>,</em> a popular manual
                contemporary with the manuscript, to delineate divergences and
                convergences between Ms. Fr. 640 and the genre. While both works
                concern the human capacity to intervene in the natural world,
                Ms. Fr. 640 is more piecemeal in its approach to cultivation
                practices, concerned with the instrumental uses of plants and
                animals rather than the long-term management of the land, as
                <em>La maison rustique</em> is.</p>

    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
    <p>In his agricultural treatise, <em>La maison rustique</em>, Charles
        Estienne (1504–1564) describes how to breed puppies that will grow up to
        become good hunting dogs.<a href="#fn1"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref1"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> This entry forms its own chapter
        within the book on hunting and wildlife and consists of multiple
        paragraphs of description of dog breeds, care, feeding, sickness, and
        breeding.<a href="#fn2"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref2"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> Estienne discusses different
        breeds of dogs by noting the color of their fur and describing which
        types of dogs have certain characteristics: some are afraid of cold
        water, some will not run in the heat, some are more vigorous, and some
        are easier to train.<a href="#fn3"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref3"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> He continues this thought by
        giving detailed descriptions of what to look for in a good hunting dog
        across breeds: upright posture, a big head with large, open nostrils,
        big ears, large haunches, and a muscular neck.<a href="#fn4"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref4"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
    <p>Ms. Fr. 640 also contains entries to do with dogs. On fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/131r/f/131r/tl"><u>131r</u></a>,
        the author-practitioner describes how to teach a dog well: “it is
        necessary to keep it tied up &amp; when it does what you command it, to
        make it love you, give it some cheese that has been held under your
        armpit.”<a href="#fn5"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref5"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> Later, he goes on to describe
        small dogs (shaggy ones ought to have a larger muzzle than others), and,
        under a heading which simply reads “dogs,” he describes a process by
        which one can avoid being bitten by a pack of raving hounds by always
        carrying small balls of pitch. If you throw these at the dogs they will
        bite down on them, sticking their jaws together such that they are
        unable to bite.<a href="#fn6"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref6"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> These entries present
        fundamentally different approaches to recording information about the
        natural world. While the two texts share dogs as a topic of interest,
        the information each author deems worthy of recording about that topic
        has a markedly different character.</p>
    <p>Such similarities and differences have inspired the following essay
        comparing and contrasting Ms. Fr. 640 with <em>La maison rustique</em>,
        in order to investigate whether or not the manuscript has significant
        relationships to genres outside the book of secrets. The sixteenth
        century saw the development of print culture, as well as economic
        pressures on food supply. Both these factors contributed to a new
        readerly appetite for domestic instruction books like <em>La maison
            rustique</em>, also known as household manuals.<a href="#fn7"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref7"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> A significant proportion of
        recipes the author-practitioner has included in his manuscript are about
        cultivation. Out of the roughly thousand entries, fifty-two of them
        mention cultivation in some way—in other words, just over five
        percent—and this inclusion merits investigation.<a href="#fn8"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref8"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> The Making and Knowing Project
        website locates the manuscript between the genres of the book of secrets
        and recipe books more broadly. Nevertheless, the author-practitioner of
        Ms. Fr. 640 chose to include a variety of recipes whose subjects overlap
        with the contents of household manuals such as <em>La maison
            rustique</em>. It is therefore instructive to look more closely at
        the ways in which the concerns of both texts overlap and diverge.</p>
    <p>The author of <em>La maison rustique</em>, Charles Estienne, was born in
        1504 into a well-to-do printing family in Paris.<a href="#fn9"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref9"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> Estienne studied anatomy and
        became a well-regarded intellectual and humanist. He published an
        anatomical treatise <em>De dissectione</em> in 1548, and a humanist
        encyclopedia that gathered together terms and names from antiquity,
        <em>Dictionarium historicvm ac poeticum: omnia gentium, hominum,
            locorum, fluminum, ac montium antiqua recentioráq; ad sacras ac
            prophanas historias, poetarúmque fabulas intelligendas necessaria
            vocabula, bono ordine complectens</em>, in 1553. The agricultural
        compendium that would become <em>La maison rustique</em> was published
        by Estienne in 1554 as <em>Praedium Rusticum</em>, a collection of
        agricultural insights gleaned from classical sources. <em>Praedium
            Rusticum</em> was translated into French and published posthumously
        as <em>La maison rustique</em> in 1564 by Estienne’s son-in-law, Jean
        Liébault. Estienne made some bad business deals and died in debtor’s
        prison before its publication, but <em>La maison rustique</em> would
        outlive him as one of the most printed and most popular volumes of the
        sixteenth and seventeenth centuries on managing a household on the
        land.<a href="#fn10"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref10"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
    <p>Although both <em>La maison rustique</em> and Ms. Fr. 640 have some
        overlapping preoccupations, the content of the instructions in each text
        makes clear their different goals. Where the author-practitioner seems
        to concern himself with either short-term benefits derived from
        cultivation or piecemeal tidbits about growing things, Estienne gives a
        more complete treatise on man’s role in the natural world. For example,
        both works have entries on artichokes, lilies, linseed, grapevines, and
        chestnuts.<a href="#fn11"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref11"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> While Estienne wrote about where
        and when to plant these items, their specific habitats and the
        particularities of their soil and climate, the author-practitioner
        offers advice about when best to harvest them, how others process that
        harvest, how long the products keep for, and how the ways in which they
        have been treated can affect their quality. Although some of the
        author-practitioner’s natural goods are derived from well-tended farms
        and fields, his interest lies in working with the products of those
        spaces rather than maintaining the spaces themselves. He is interested
        in the land but seems not to be responsible for it.<a href="#fn12"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref12"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
    <p>To compare these two works, this essay offers a preliminary examination
        of the organization and contents of their respective entries and points
        to areas for further research. The guiding questions are simple: why
        might each author have included the entries he did? And, what
        information is necessary for a recipe to be useful? We can get closer to
        answering these questions by close reading and thinking through the
        characteristics of each book.</p>

    <p>In <em>La maison rustique</em>, Estienne offers a holistic account of the
        world of farming in early modern France. From the building of the
        farmhouse to the keeping of peacocks to the job of the mule-driver,
        Estienne seems to want to prepare the reader for every eventuality, to
        cover everything one might need to know about keeping a farm.<a

           id="fnref14"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> His writing style enhances this
        ambition: Estienne has written not just instructions but a narrative of
        long, connected soliloquies on the physical world, the attitude with
        which to work the land, and the understanding and temperament that a
        person should have in order to do this job. His chapters present
        discrete subjects, but their contents can be long-winded and
        philosophical.<a href="#fn15"

        not a step-by-step manual but a guide to the construction of a peaceable
        kingdom in which temperaments are regulated, diseases are cured, and
        crops prosper in a harmonious, cyclical relationship.</p>
    <p>By contrast, Ms. Fr. 640 is a compendium of disparate tricks,
        suggestions, experiments, and advice.<a href="#fn17"
           class="footnote-ref"

        each of Estienne’s entries is sewn into the fabric of the text under a

        same explicit structure.<a href="#fn18"

           role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> Where <em>La maison
            rustique</em> is a completed, published work, Ms. Fr. 640 is perhaps
        a step in an ongoing work-in-progress. The manuscript does not appear to
        be a first draft; it displays some evidence of editing, but it is not
        complete. The author-practitioner may have been preparing his work for
        publication, writing it up for a private patron, or compiling a working
        notebook for a practitioner. For example, he sometimes instructs himself
        to “try” a process, once notes when a process is “<em>non bona</em>,”
        and makes marginal additions or amendments.<a href="#fn19"
           class="footnote-ref"

           role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a> Still, while the recipes in Ms.
        Fr. 640 tend to be shorter and blunter than Estienne’s flowing prose,
        there are subjects on which the author-practitioner seems to have
        acquired extensive and detailed knowledge. It is worth investigating
        what each author considers to be important information to record within
        each entry.</p>
    <p>For Estienne, some of the most essential information to include relates
        to the quality of the soil, the shape that gardens and orchards should
        take, and the daily tasks involved in maintaining the health of
        cultivated plots of land. He discusses these topics with regard to
        vegetable gardens and vineyards as well as orchards and forests.<a

        gives information about how to care for them when they fall ill, how to
        feed them, when they breed, and how to ensure the continuation of that

           id="fnref21"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a> Sometimes he makes a particular
        point to discuss the end product of a given instruction, as when he
        discusses which wines are good to use as medicine. There are, however,
        some areas of the text where he is brusque. In a recipe for attracting
        turtles, Estienne directs the reader to take salts of ammonia, onion,
        and veal grease and to make little balls with the odiferous mixture,
        which are then rolled towards the turtles in order to induce them to
        approach.<a href="#fn22"

    <p>A concern for results seems to drive the author-practitioner, determining
        what information he chooses to include in his entries. He mentions
        qualities such as beauty and profit when evaluating the intended
        products of his recipes. For example, on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/46r/f/46r/tl"><u>46r</u></a>,
        the author-practitioner gives a recipe for “Flowers of trees.”<a
           href="#fn25"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref25"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a> At the end of a list of medical
        and cosmetic advice, a small section gives counsel on grafting for the
        production of better flowers. The author-practitioner says that grafts
        must be made sparsely: “Those that are seen with every new ☾ [moon]
        scarcely come to profit. One ought to leave only two buds on the graft.”
        It is not clear from this instruction what the “profit” of the flowers
        might be. It seems as though the author-practitioner is saying that
        grafted flowering trees which are allowed to bud too often produce
        inferior flowers. But inferior in what way? What is the use to which
        they might be put?</p>
    <p>The author-practitioner has similar concerns when it comes to living
        creatures as well. Where Estienne is occupied by farmyard birds raised
        for eating, hunting, or decoration, the author-practitioner concerns
        himself with songbirds and other small birds that would not suit well
        for those purposes. These types of birds would be more suited to keep as
        pets or for the pleasing effect of their song or the color of their
        feathers (a lucrative trade in the early modern world). They might also
        be used as other animals in Ms. Fr. 640, to create an artificial
        semblance of life in an ornament such as a metal lifecast. The recipes
        that concern their treatment and capture give us a few clues as to why
        the author-practitioner found them useful.</p>
    <p>In two entries entitled “Birds,” both on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/49v/f/49v/tl"><u>49v</u></a>,
        the author-practitioner notes small details about a variety of birds,
        such as larks and turtle-doves. He explains when to catch them, both in
        their life cycle and the cycle of the year (young, so that they are not
        yet wild; before Michaelmas or “they scarcely live,” or, alternatively,
        between All Saints’ Day and Christmas). He describes a malady to which
        they are prone and a means to remedy it. He also takes pains to describe
        their likes and dislikes, what they like to eat, when they like to
        breed, and what particular type of sand they prefer to take a dust bath
        in. In these entries, the only references to what the birds might be
        useful for is the preoccupation with their singing and the note that one
        might want to “fatten them for selling.” He continues the bird theme on
        the next page, fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/50v/f/50v/tl"><u>50v</u></a>,
        with an entry on “Small birds,” and on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/98v/f/98v/tl"><u>98v</u></a>
        with another discussion of “Birds.” In the former, he mentions which
        breeds are cheaper or more expensive to keep and substitutions for
        expensive feed. He mentions their breeding patterns in the wild but not
        ways to breed them in captivity. Birds seem to be a natural resource to
        be exploited rather than a renewable possession to be cultivated.<a
           href="#fn26"

    <p>It seems that the author-practitioner cares less about husbanding animals
        than controlling them and making use of them in a short-term sense. In
        another example, the author-practitioner presents two recipes for making
        animals follow, “For making a horse follow” on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/54v/f/54v/tl"><u>54v</u></a>
        and “For attracting pigeons” on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/66v/f/66v/tl"><u>66v</u></a>.<a
           href="#fn27"

           id="fnref27"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a> In each case, the reader is
        instructed to present the animal with a reward (for horses, a sweet bun;
        for pigeons, fried hemp seed). These instructions are characteristic of
        the author-practitioner’s attitude towards controlling animals: find
        something they want and use it to make them compliant.</p>
    <p>There are sections of the manuscript where the author-practitioner is
        remarkably descriptive about the care and feeding of a particular plant
        or animal. It is tempting to take this claim and draw further
        conclusions about the reasons the author-practitioner had for including
        such detail in his cultivation recipes. Were the subjects he chose to
        write about and the details he focused on especially useful to him in
        some way? There are instructions that describe the use of particular
        ingredients, the cultivation of which is mentioned elsewhere in the
        manuscript, but we cannot know whether such entries were intended to be
        cross-referenced and used in concert. Early in the manuscript, on fol.
        <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/46r/f/46r/tl"><u>46r</u></a>,
        the author-practitioner writes an entry for “Flowers of trees.”<a

        he includes instructions for preserving dried flowers “in the same state
        all year.”<a href="#fn29"

    <p>When discussing pastel woad on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/39r/f/39r/tl"><u>39r</u></a>,
        the author-practitioner goes into great detail. This is one of the only
        places in the manuscript where the connection between cultivation and
        result is made explicit, where the knowledge of cultivation comes
        together with the author-practitioner’s personal praxis.<a href="#fn30"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref30"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a> He discusses the different
        regions of France where woad grows as well as giving detailed examples

           id="fnref31"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a> His descriptions carry the
        reader through the cycle of planting woad, both in terms of specific
        times of year (woad is to be planted “on Saint Anthony’s Day in
        January”) and the ripeness and readiness of the plant for harvesting
        (“when, put in the mouth, it gives a taste as of vinegar”). Most
        crucially, he indicates the usefulness of woad for dyeing, the
        quantities one should use when dyeing, and the cost of good quality
        woad. The author-practitioner does not give attribution for this recipe,
        so we cannot know whether he acquired this knowledge firsthand or was
        given it by another person. It may never become clear why the
        author-practitioner chose to be so detailed in some of his entries and
        so brief in others, but the difference in tone is instructive. Although
        the author-practitioner is not always thorough, he does write down the
        same kinds of information as Estienne does when it suits him. The
        manuscript is not the same kind of book as <em>La maison rustique</em>,
        but each can contain similar information presented in comparable
        formats. This is especially evident in their shared focus on noting the
        time of year in cultivation recipes and shorthanding entry content by
        means of job titles.</p>
    <p>Both authors take pains to note the time of year in their cultivation
        entries. Estienne writes an entire chapter on the place and time that
        each type of fruit tree should be fertilized and planted, while the
        author-practitioner drops in time-based information throughout his
        entries on grafting trees.<a href="#fn32"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref32"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a> In his entry on lilies, he makes
        note of the fact that bulbs should be broken in their first year in
        order that they should bloom again in the next.<a href="#fn33"

           id="fnref33"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
    <p>Another intriguing similarity between the texts is the way each uses jobs
        as titles for various entries. Book one of <em>La maison rustique</em>
        contains several chapters that are titled with job descriptions, such as
        “L’office du fermier” 8b; “L’estat de la fermiere” 9b; “Le coulombier”
        19b; “Le bouvier” 21a; “Le porcher” 24b; “Le berger” 25b; “Le chevrier”
        27b; “Le muletier” 33b.<a href="#fn34"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref34"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a> These entries contain
        information about the temperament a person should have to do each job, a
        discussion of their importance, and specific recipes for sick animals
        under their care. The author-practitioner also uses jobs as title
        headings, for example, “Laboureur” (“Plowman”) on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/9r/f/9r/tl"><u>9r</u></a>.<a
           href="#fn35"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref35"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>35</sup></a> The entry goes on to give the
        following instructions:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Because millet is by nature very dry, harvesters beat it most often
            at night in the cool &amp; by moonlight. Which could not be done
            with another grain that is wetter, for one must let the sunbeams
            pass through, and one scarcely beats it until the sun is approaching
            midday. Quickly after the millet is cut, one needs to plow the earth
            because the root eats it &amp; makes it lean as much as if the
            millet was still standing. The ground where the millet has been sown
            diminishes much in its fertility, which one knows at the next sowing
            that one makes after that. But above all the grain called
            <em>pomole</em> in Gascony or <em>baillard</em> in France, makes the
            earth shake seven years later, according to the common saying. Beans
            improve &amp; correct the soil, provided that one lets the roots
            &amp; stems rot in it.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>Clearly, this is not the same category of
        information as Estienne included under his job-title headings. The
        author-practitioner is relating advice about millet that is quite
        detailed and specific to certain regions of France. Is it possible that
        this is advice he received from a plowman and recorded in his book?
        Perhaps the title heading is a way of attributing the information. Later
        in the manuscript, on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/93r/f/93r/tl"><u>93r</u></a>,
        the author-practitioner provides an “Observation from rustics.” It notes
        “that when it freezes on Palm Sunday, it freezes all the months of the
        year.”<a href="#fn36"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref36"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>36</sup></a> At first glance, this title
        heading might seem to indicate direct attribution, as in “Laboureur.”
        But the term “rustics” is much less specific than “plowman,” and it
        seems implausible that a fieldworker in the sixteenth-century would
        refer to himself as a “rustic.” Perhaps, this information was related to
        the author-practitioner from someone without farm experience as a kind
        of generalized axiom.</p>
    <h2 id="recipes-in-context">Recipes in Context</h2>
    <p>Estienne participated in the goals of humanist reformers who sought to
        compile information from antiquity and from the world around them to
        provide models of behavior for individuals and society. His other works
        were attempts at comprehensive understandings of human anatomy and the
        French language. Therefore, we might understand <em>La maison
            rustique</em> as part of that intellectual project.<a href="#fn37"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref37"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>37</sup></a> Additionally, as Rebecca
        Bushnell has suggested, at this time, many landowners were responding to
        increasing economic pressures including higher prices and food
        shortages, and a literature that prized efficiency and economy in the
        management of land became ever more popular.<a href="#fn38"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref38"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>38</sup></a> As a genre, these gardening
        books were concerned with presenting complete information about the
        natural world. The combination of these concerns may have informed
        Estienne’s decision to divide his work into six books, each covering a
        different area of farming and husbandry.<a href="#fn39"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref39"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>39</sup></a> By working his way outward from
        the farmhouse toward the countryside, Estienne was able to offer a
        comprehensive view of the farmer’s domain, as well as a logical
        progression for the text, which would organize his recipes in such a way
        that they could easily be found by a casual reader.</p>
    <p>The author-practitioner’s entries on cultivation seem intended to
        investigate and bend the natural world to his will, not to create a
        long-term, connected strategy for ongoing productivity. In that spirit,
        his recipes about cultivation are scattered throughout the manuscript.
        Sometimes they appear close to each other in the text, suggesting a
        thematic train of thought or that they may have been consciously grouped
        together. In other cases, the same topic will appear multiple times,
        separated by large portions of the text.</p>
    <p>For example, the author-practitioner writes entries about keeping fruits
        fresh throughout the year on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/50r/f/50r/tl"><u>50r</u></a>

        detailed and delicate process of sterilizing glass ampoules and then
        placing stone fruit within them, sealing the top shut with wax, and
        leaving them in submerged in water, either in a vat in the cellar in
        summer or in the bottom of a well in winter. In the latter, the
        author-practitioner describes a very similar process, but this one has
        the addition of straw within the container to prevent the glass bottles
        from breaking. Why would he go to the trouble of writing the same recipe
        twice in two different sections of the manuscript? It could be that he
        had forgotten he had already written it once, although this seems
        unlikely. It is possible that the second recipe presents a second
        attempt after the first had failed. Or, it might be that there are two
        good ways of achieving the same result, both worth recording.<a

           id="fnref41"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>41</sup></a></p>
    <p>As well as returning to similar ideas and processes across the
        manuscript, sometimes the author-practitioner seems struck by a thematic
        connection between seemingly disconnected recipes, collecting them all
        in the same place. On fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/71r/f/71r/tl"><u>71r</u></a>,
        he begins with an entry on amber, followed by another on the knotted
        roots of the elm tree.<a href="#fn42"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref42"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>42</sup></a> These are followed by entries on
        mulled wine, horses, and eau-de-vie.<a href="#fn43"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref43"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>43</sup></a> Judging from their headings
        alone, these three entries would appear unrelated, but even a brief skim
        shows their content to follow one entry upon the other. The
        author-practitioner describes the English practice of mulling wine in
        vivid language. He goes on to explain that this wine is often drunk by
        the English because they are unable to get sweet wine shipped to
        them—the sea voyage being long enough that the wine “is clarified” and
        loses its taste. Then, he declares that the English give their horses
        mulled wine in order to invigorate them, and that the Irish do not drink
        wine at all but “eau-de-vie, which they use almost as habitually as we
        do wine.” Here, we have a disparate array of subjects: lazy horses,
        mulling wine, the drinking habits of the Irish, how wine behaves on long
        sea journeys. Perhaps in no other work would we see such an array of
        concerns listed together on one page and even logically connected in the
        mind of the author-practitioner. Whereas some recipes are arranged in a
        context that does not make sense to a modern reader (the recipe for
        keeping chestnuts is listed between a Latin saying and a recipe for
        scented candles, for example), this connected train of thought suggests
        that the author-practitioner drew associations between the subjects of
        his entries and potentially considered them thematically linked.<a

    <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>This overview of significant thematic links and practical divergences
        between Ms. Fr. 640 and <em>La maison rustique</em> has raised questions
        about genre as well as the aims and audiences of instructional texts.
        While there is more research to be done, there are some preliminary
        conclusions that can be drawn. It appears that Ms. Fr. 640 connects with
        the genre of the household manual, yet aims to achieve different
        outcomes. There is significant overlap in the topics covered by both the
        author-practitioner and Estienne, from the care of animals, trees, and
        plants, to the preserving of fruits and nuts, to the people who worked
        the land (see Table 1 above). There is also overlap in the subjects
        deemed important by both authors: feed, soil quality, time of year,
        geographic location. However, where Estienne is mostly punctilious about
        including connections that link his entries to one another, the
        author-practitioner often leaves us with gaps. Where Estienne attempts
        to be comprehensive in most of his chapters while leaving some brief
        (see “Tortues”), the author-practitioner largely keeps his entries brief
        except for a few notable examples (such as “Pastel woad” on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/39r/f/39r/tl"><u>39r</u></a>
        and “Silkworms” on fols. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/53v/f/53v/tl"><u>53v</u></a>–<a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/54r/f/54r/tl"><u>54r</u></a>).
        Where Estienne attempts to offer breadth and depth of knowledge about
        the natural world, the author-practitioner concentrates on information
        that can produce a result in the short term. Estienne lays out the
        contents of his book in a way that is logical to him and accessible to
        readers. The author-practitioner groupes entries together in a way that

        make about why the entries in the author-practitioner’s manuscript

        evidence about his thought process?</p>
    <p>As Pamela Smith discusses in her article “Why Write a Book?,” the
        transition between the written word and lived experience, and vice
        versa, is not a linear one but a series of negotiations.<a href="#fn46"

           role="doc-noteref"><sup>46</sup></a> Books are not just repositories
        of certain knowledge but are themselves workshops where ideas are
        generated and tested, and where experiments and hypotheses are recorded
        or discarded. Whether building a world in Estienne’s <em>maison</em> or
        building knowledge in the author-practitioner’s <em>boutique</em>, both
        texts present knowledge about effecting change in the natural world. For
        Estienne, the goal was to create a universe of productivity in which the
        landholder could flourish. For the author-practitioner, the goal is not
        entirely clear, but his primary preoccupation seems to be the creation
        of effects. <em>La maison rustique</em> needed to be as comprehensible
        as possible in order to be a good investment for the publisher, seller,
        and consumer. Ms. Fr. 640 apparently had no such constraints, not even
        as a manuscript exemplar to be copied and re-copied. As Smith points
        out, one goal of practical knowledge and how-to books was to convey how
        to generalize and improvise in preparation for the unknown.<a

                    can be found across Europe at this time. In the German
                    lands, household matters were also a means to preserve the
                    social order. Connections between the <em>hausvater</em>,
                    patriarchal master of the home, the <em>landesvater</em>,
                    the government as master of the nation, and God the Father
                    as master of the earthly plane, were seen to fit together in
                    a metaphorical framework to explain the ordered working of
                    the world. For more on <em>hausvater</em> literature, see:

                    precursor to the genre of the household manual in the print
                    age was <em>Le Menagier de Paris</em>, a manuscript from
                    medieval Paris containing instructions written in the style
                    of an older man speaking to his young wife-to-be. The
                    <em>Menagier</em> was copied and distributed across Europe
                    and contained recipes for food and medicine, as well as tips

                <p>This reprinting did not reproduce the contents of
                    <em>Praedium Rusticum</em> but instead significantly changed
                    the organization and content of the entries. The genre
                    builds on a classical tradition of classification and
                    categorization of the domestic (Latin: <em>domus</em>, the
                    household) which began with treatises on the organization of
                    the home, the state, and the body itself. <em>Praedium
                        Rusticum</em> reproduced classical texts in this
                    tradition, but <em>La maison rustique</em>, like other
                    popular works the household manual genre, interwove
                    philosophical and ideological concerns with practical
                    everyday advice. Interestingly, near the beginning of <em>La
                        maison rustique,</em> Estienne describes the habits of
                    hens and the good order of a well-maintained henhouse. As he
                    details ways to cure sicknesses and how frequently to clean
                    a henhouse, he includes a small marginal heading entitled
                    <em>secrets de nature</em>, under which he describes a
                    method from “Columelle,” the Roman agriculturist Lucius
                    Junius Moderatus Columella (4 – c. 70 AD), which requires a
                    laurel leaf or a head of garlic to be placed in with the
                    hens while they are broody to induce them to lay well. This
                    is the only time the word “secret” is used in <em>La maison
                        rustique,</em> and it references knowledge gained not by
                    the experience of the everyday farmer but from a classical
                    authority. A comparison of <em>La maison rustique</em> to
                    works influenced or inspired by it in France over the next
                    two centuries yields: Louis Liger (1658–1717), <em>General
                        Economy of the Country, or New</em> Maison Rustique,
                    harking directly back to the title of Estienne’s work.
                    Olivier de Serres (1539–1619) did not make the connection
                    quite so explicit in his important book on the management of
                    the land published only a few decades after <em>La maison

                    These folios contain names of people, both artisans and
                    classical and contemporary authors, as well as book titles.
                    The relationship of these folios to the rest of the
                    manuscript is not clear. They may have formed a resource for
                    the author-practitioner, or they may indicate that he was
                    aware of and in some way participating in the lively
                    classical, humanist intellectual climate at this time. See

                <p>Francisco Alonso-Almeida gives a useful account of the genre
                    of the English recipe book, also very actively produced at
                    this time. Although his work focuses on the seventeenth and
                    eighteenth centuries, some of his claims apply to Ms. Fr.
                    640. The recipe book as a conceptual object is a part of
                    what Almeida calls a “discourse colony,” a genre of text
                    whose utility is derived from the relationships between its
                    component parts. Like a shopping list, the meaning of each
                    component part is unchanged by the order in which it appears
                    within the whole, but each part contributes to the function
                    of the text at large. Ms. Fr. 640 can be understood in light
                    of this model. The tone of the author-practitioner’s writing
                    shifts between different sections of his work, which concern
                    subjects such as weaponry, taxidermy, and casting in metal.
                    See Francisco Alonso-Almeida, “Genre conventions in English
                    recipes, 1600–1800,” in <em>Reading and Writing Recipe

                <p>There is evidence that the author-practitioner may have
                    intended his manuscript to be printed and published, such as
                    the use of headings, language which addresses a reader, and
                    notes which might be preparatory to an introductory
                    dedication (fols. <a
                       href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/1r/f/1r/tl"><u>1r</u></a>,

                       href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/162r/f/162r/tl"><u>162r</u></a>,
                    and <a
                       href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/166r/f/166r/tl"><u>166r</u></a>).
                    Nevertheless, the form in which we have the text remains
                    unconstrained by the logic of a publishing process. On fol.
                    166r, the collection of notes that might be intended for a
                    preface follow the same conventions that Estienne does,
                    justifying reasons for bringing this information together in
                    a particular way. The author-practitioner compares the work
                    of an author to a hen distributing to her chicks: “As the
                    hen carefully searches the garbage thrown out of a house for
                    a crumb or a grain that she divides among her chicks, thus
                    one distributes to orphans that which has been sought among
                    the arts considered vile &amp; abject.” He also compares it
                    to a farmer who has left some ears of corn in the field as a
                    way to explain his role as both a compiler and distributor
                    of secrets: “If something is omitted: the harvester is not
                    reproached for leaving some ears of wheat.” While it is true
                    that Ms. Fr. 640 is an unfinished manuscript, that should
                    not imply that <em>La maison rustique</em> is a closed book,
                    so to speak. Recall that the edition from which this essay
                    draws was printed in 1564 after Estienne’s death. It was
                    edited and published by his son-in-law, Jean Liébault, who
                    took Estienne’s original Latin work and remade it. <em>La
                        maison rustique</em> would remain in print for decades,
                    inspiring translations and reworked editions. While Ms. Fr.
                    640 perhaps does not exist in what might have been its
                    “final” stage, neither does <em>La maison rustique</em>.
                    Discussions of finality in collaborative texts like recipe
                    books and books of secrets are not always productive, and
                    indeed the Making and Knowing Project is concerned with yet
                    another layer of editing, conversation, and reshaping of its
                    central text in creating this digital critical edition.<a

                <p>Estienne’s brevity raises questions about the importance of
                    this particular entry within the rest of the text. Were
                    turtles not as ubiquitous on farms as other types of
                    animals? Was Estienne working from incomplete information?
                    This is a question that bears further investigation.<a

                    observations, recommending a fertilizer of dead dogs, but he
                    includes such remarks in a larger discussion of caring for

                <p>As Roger Chartier has shown, in the period in which either of
                    these texts was written, there was no notion that a singular
                    author was responsible for a text. Instead, whether
                    manuscript or print, books were the site of conversation
                    between multiple contributors, from assistants and
                    apprentices to copyists, booksellers, and publishers.
                    Similarly, the contents of books such as <em>La maison
                        rustique</em> or Ms. Fr. 640 were not presented as the
                    work of a solitary mind. Perhaps instead these books act as
                    conversations—about social roles, forms of knowledge, and
                    art and nature. The Making and Knowing Project demonstrates
                    that the life of a text does not end when it is published,
                    or when the original author stops adding to it. See Smith,
                    “Why Write a Book?,” 39; See also, Roger Chartier, <em>The
                        Order of Books: Readers, Authors, and Libraries in
