        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <div>
            <p>A comparison between four manuscripts demonstrates an evolution
                from the genre of the recipe to the experimental essay. As a
                notion of general experience slowly transformed into the
                practice of experimentation at a particular time and place,
                how-to accounts became increasingly historicized and
                personalized. In contrast to widespread narratives depicting
                modern science as a thinning of previously thick, embodied
                knowledge, this evolution demonstrates knowledge thickening,
                becoming more personalized and explicit both about material
                experience and symbolic interpretation. This is apparent in the
                case of Ms. Fr. 640, in the frequent use of the first-person
                voice, especially at points in which the author-practitioner was
                most actively engaged in speculating about and experimenting
                with new techniques.This long-term evolution of the experimental
                essay situates the epistemology of making and knowing in
                relation to previous long-term accounts concerning the
                scientific method. Previously, the experimental essay has been
                associated with Restoration experimental philosophy, as it
                developed out of the works of Sir Francis Bacon. In such
                accounts, the experimental essay serves as the ideal expression
                of a particular epistemology. This essay backdates the
                experimental essay and demonstrates its slow emergence from the
                genre of the recipe. Showing the experimental essay’s connection
                with prior genres also suggests experimental philosophy’s
                connection with previous epistemologies. Neither the
                experimental essay nor experimental philosophy emerged fully
                formed in the works of Bacon and his followers. On the slow
                course of development that produced them, we can situate Ms. Fr.
                640 at an important stage of the personalization and
                historicization of experiment.</p>

        spectrum of emerging literary techniques that produced the experimental
        essay, the key genre associated with English experimental philosophers
        and often heralded as the ancestor to the scientific journal article.<a
           href="#fn2"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref2"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> The author-practitioner was
        writing at a historical moment of methodological diversification that
        opened up a range of different ways to inscribe knowledge, and to
        transmit it along a spectrum between artisanal and scholarly audiences
        and practices. In this case, the method that was diversifying was that
        of recipe writing, which offered a long-established convention for how
        to inscribe and transmit practices of making. Writers departed from
        recipe writing to greater or lesser degrees, even as the genre of
        recipes persisted robustly, as it does still today. In the
        author-practitioner’s case, I argue, his manuscript fell between a
        standard recipe collection and a collection of experimental essays.
        Here, I compare it to three other French manuscripts spanning the late
        sixteenth to mid-seventeenth centuries, Bordeaux Ms. 1213, Sloane Ms.
        3426, and Sloane Ms. 3423.</p>
    <p>The experimental essay typically has been put in the context of lengthier
        philosophical genres, such as the dialogue and the treatise, rather than
        the recipe.<a href="#fn3"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref3"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> Michelle DiMeo, to my knowledge,
        has thus far been the only scholar to contrast the recipe and the
        experimental essay. She does so in the case of the genre conventions
        Robert Boyle deployed in the experimental essay versus in his recipes in
        the late seventeenth century.<a href="#fn4"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref4"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> This essay explores an earlier
        moment, before the conventions of the experimental essay had been
        established and while it was still emerging as a genre.</p>
    <p>This analysis of a slow development from recipe to essay calls into
        question a powerful narrative concerning the nature of modern scientific
        rhetoric. As Ted Porter has noted, at the heart of many accounts of
        early modernity, from Michel Foucault’s <em>Order of Things</em> to
        accounts of the invention of the scientific method, we find modern
        science presented as the “thinning” of knowledge. According to such
        accounts, a superficial, universally valid, and highly technical
        database of information, produced by following the rote steps of a
        depersonalized, and thus objective, scientific method, replaced an
        embodied, local, subjective, world of allusion and symbolism entangled
        with materials themselves. As Porter has argued, thickness bears within
        itself tradition and cultural meanings attached to local practices and
        materials, whereas thinness presents itself as universally portable and
        replicable because it is freed from cultural baggage; “Science, allied
        in practice with industry and bureaucracy, stood more than ever for a
        standardized world, for uniform rules that presume no need for the
        nurturing of traditions or the cultivation of judgment.”<a href="#fn5"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref5"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> This dichotomy is illusory,
        Porter argues, because actual scientific labor is also thick, material,
        and embodied and practiced as a localized craft learned from a master.
    </p>
    <p>Through this analysis of the emergence of the experimental essay, we
        might add a further twist to Porter’s revisionist account of the
        modernist transition from thickness to thinness. The ancient genre of
        the recipe is, in fact, extremely thin, at least in its explicit
        textuality. As William Eamon has discussed, late antique encyclopedists
        efficiently packaged knowledge for transmission and translation,
        shearing off many particulars from their original contexts and omitting
        features, such as images, that might have accompanied original texts.<a
           href="#fn6"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref6"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> It is my argument here that the
        long-lived genre of the recipes was thinned in late antiquity, and then
        thickened in early modernity, evolving into the new genre of the
        experimental essay.</p>
    <p>What made an experimental essay? In the case of the genre in late
        seventeenth-century England, Maurizio Gotti has pointed to brevity,
        richness of detail, a “lack of assertiveness,” a limited use of
        rhetorical devices, clarity, simplicity of form, and objectivity (which
        Gotti sees in an eagerness to differentiate “degrees of certainty”).<a
           href="#fn7"

           id="fnref7"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> The idea of objectivity is a
        complex and polemicized one in the period;<a href="#fn8"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref8"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> putting objectivity aside, I will
        look for Gotti’s other criteria, in particular the use of the first
        person, explicit self-reflexivity, and the prominence of the idea of
        “essays” or trials themselves.</p>
    <p>Some literary critics have differentiated between literary essays and
        experimental ones along the axis of thinness and thickness Porter
        identified. They have assumed that even though experimental essays are
        self-reflexive and appeared in first-person narration, this was a
        depersonalized narration, unlike the first-person narration of literary
        figures such as Montaigne. George Levine wrote in his introductory note
        to James Paradis’s essay, “Montaigne, Boyle, and the Essay of
        Experience,” that in the very “literary form through which Michel de
        Montaigne sought to embody the self,” the self was also expelled,
        “experience was depersonalized,” and thus “it was made available to a
        community of scientific experts.”<a href="#fn9"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref9"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> Likewise, Paradis argued that
        Boyle’s “I” was different from Montaigne’s since Boyle’s “experimental
        essay has a core of experimental fact that, by convention, is at a
        remove from the idiosyncratic self.”<a href="#fn10"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref10"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> Both Levine and Paradis’
        interpretation, although appearing in a volume entitled <em>One
            Culture</em>, rest upon assumptions about what divides science from
        the rest—that is, depersonalization, expertise, and facts. They
        anticipate the rhetoric of the contemporary scientific periodical that
        Paradis, like many others, traces back to Boyle’s use of the
        experimental essay.</p>
    <p>The work of Barbara Shapiro, however, has since shown that the
        seventeenth-century English culture of fact was not depersonalized, but
        heavily socially constituted.<a href="#fn11"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref11"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> What we see textually in
        comparing texts that span a spectrum between recipes and experimental
        essays is a much <em>greater</em> personalization of knowledge. There is
        no reason to assume that it is any less the case in experimental essays
        than in other essays. As experiment slowly transitioned from a general
        experience to a notion of a contrived experience in a particular time
        and place and a particular individual, accounts of process were
        increasingly personalized and historicized.<a href="#fn12"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref12"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
    <p>Both recipes and experimental essays were products of large-scale
        historical processes. The ancient traditions of recipes and visions,
        honed for transmission through centuries and across languages and
        cultures, travelled lightly. Such terse formats may have left implicit
        practices of critical self-reflexivity, that in the greater
        expansiveness afforded by cheaper material supports for texts, such as
        paper, and more conducive conditions for knowledge production in
        general, could be explicitly dilated upon.</p>
    <p>Essays were inflected by the skepticism and intersocial doubt that
        reigned in the early modern period for several reasons, including the
        wars of religion that racked France from the 1560s, the general
        untrustworthiness of the printed word, and the emergence of new forms of
        probabilistic reasoning, such as the “reason of state.”<a href="#fn13"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref13"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> Essays presented themselves as
        an individual viewpoint, open to doubting and being doubted. Recipes do
        not present themselves in this manner. This is not to say that recipes
        were used uncritically. As Elaine Leong has shown, users were
        well-versed in an array of tools for querying and testing recipes,
        including copying, marginal annotations, assurances through attribution,
        amending, and crossing out.<a href="#fn14"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref14"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> These practices show, as
        Michelle DiMeo noted, that “a recipe was not considered fixed even as it
        entered print.”<a href="#fn15"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref15"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> Through widespread practices of
        textual emendation and marginal annotation, readers treated recipes as
        open to doubt, but they did so against the grain of the text of the
        recipe itself, which often claimed efficacy and universal validity.
        Essays, by contrast, make practices of self-criticism explicit and open
        up their infrastructure to a deeper level of querying by others.</p>
    <p>Essays offered probable knowledge in lieu of the certainty promised by
        philosophical systems. As Dana Jalobeanu has written, “It is true that
        for Montaigne, as for Bacon, the human mind can never be fully at rest;
        seemingly ‘fixed’ opinions are merely illusory marks which do not steady
        its course.”<a href="#fn16"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref16"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> As Steven Shapin wrote
        concerning Boyle’s adoption of the genre, “the essay (that is, the
        piece-meal reporting of experimental trials) was explicitly contrasted
        to the natural philosophical system.”<a href="#fn17"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref17"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
    <p>The essay never replaced the recipe; recipes outlasted the experimental
        essay by centuries. Still, we might note change over time in how the
        early moderns built bridges between these genres. While recipes still
        abound today, they are generally not accepted as a source of valid
        knowledge within academia or other centers of elite learning. This was
        not the case in the early modern period, when long-separated streams of
        knowledge were purposefully brought together. The development of the
        experimental essay out of the recipe offers one means to offer a nuanced
        account about a spectrum spanning formal scientific rhetoric and textual
        practices of the craft world.</p>
    <p>To survey what the spectrum might have looked like when it came to
        literary technologies for engaging experimentation, I will compare the
        rhetorical features and mise-en-page of four French manuscripts on
        paper: Bordeaux Ms. 1213, Ms. Fr. 640, Sloane Ms. 3426, and Sloane Ms.
        3423, the latter two from the collection of Sir Theodore de Mayerne
        (1573–1655). Viewing these manuscripts as falling along a spectrum
        presupposes that there is no dichotomy between implicit and explicit,
        embodied and textual knowledge. Rather, there are forms of texts that
        are more heavily connected to embodied practice than others are, and
        that leave more knowledge tacit.<a href="#fn18"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref18"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> Likewise, there are also
        material practices and experimental gestures that rely more heavily on
        textual inscriptions than do others.</p>
    <h2 id="bordeaux-ms.-1213">Bordeaux Ms. 1213</h2>
    <p>The Bordeaux Ms. 1213, a collection of alchemical, pharmaceutical,
        culinary and cosmetic recipes, represents standard, international recipe
        practice. This manuscript, which I was only able to consult as a digital
        surrogate, offers a good comparison to Ms. Fr. 640.<a href="#fn19"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref19"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a> It is 141 folios long, 210 x 150
        mm, and, like Ms. Fr. 640, contains more than one hand. One recipe’s
        attribution to “Mr. Malus ma[istre] dela monnoye de bourdeaux,” that is,
        Jean Malus, master of the mint at Bordeaux from 1587–1594, suggests an
        approximate date, although the manuscript was written over a period of
        time. The manuscript thus comes from a similar time as Ms. Fr. 640, and
        not far from Toulouse, where Ms. Fr. 640 was likely composed.</p>

    <p>What is not found in this manuscript is usage of the first person, much

        This is in contrast to Ydeley’s published work, in which Ydeley, in
        order to garner approval for his cures, notes how he used a particular

    <h2 id="ms.-fr.-640">Ms. Fr. 640</h2>
    <p>I consulted this manuscript through the Making and Knowing Project’s
        digital edition. Ms. Fr. 640 includes some recipes indistinguishable in
        form from Bordeaux Ms. 1213, such as fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/44v/f/44v/tl"><u>44v</u></a>,
        “Excellent&nbsp;water&nbsp;against the plague&nbsp;of&nbsp;Monsieur de
        Montorsin” or fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/170v/f/170v/tl"><u>170v</u></a>,
        “Against plague.” Both are short paragraphs of a series of commands,
        with limited detail and no first-person narration about what was tried.
        As in any recipe collection, these point to a certain amount of
        repetition and haphazard order; the two medicines against the plague are
        separated from each other, and there is no comparison between the two or
        speculation about what might make them efficacious. As in the case of
        Bordeaux Ms. 1213, the author-practitioner does not note the time or
        location of processes. Marginal censures appear, although infrequently,
        and in one case in Latin with a “<em>non bona</em>” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/13r/f/13r/tl"><u>13r</u></a>).
    </p>
    <p>Such standard recipe presentation in this manuscript is especially
        apparent for the medical recipes, which appear throughout the
        manuscript. Notably, almost no medical recipes in this manuscript relate
        to sicknesses of women or children, compared to three for dog’s mange,
        suggesting that the author-practitioner was not collecting them for the
        purposes of household management.<a href="#fn35"

    <p>The author-practitioner explicitly reached to knowledge domains other
        than his own in his frequent categorization of craft knowledge under the
        headings of various professions, lending at times the nature of a
        common-place book organization to the manuscript.<a href="#fn36"

           id="fnref36"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>36</sup></a> Collecting professions was a
        widespread period interest, evidenced in Tommaso Garzoni’s 1585
        showcase, <em>Piazza universale di tutte le professioni del mondo,</em>
        and the author-practitioner’s list of a variety of processes and the
        collection of craft knowledge under different professional headings,
        which adumbrates later efforts in what was called the history of trades,
        such as John Evelyn’s catalog of arts and commonplace book of trades.<a
           href="#fn37"

           id="fnref37"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
    <p>Among the forms of knowledge of different trades that the
        author-practitioner was interested in documenting were practices of
        apprenticeship and learning as well as literary technologies, not only
        in the obvious case of the trade of the “scribe,” but also in the array
        of different books kept by merchants. He described how merchants have
        four books, one a reference work for apprentices, one the rough daily
        account or the “waste book,” the “sales book” in which the latter is put
        into a “clean copy” and finally, the perfected “account book,” so
        authoritative that it “is taken as evidence in court” (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/9r/f/9r/tl"><u>9r</u></a>).
        He went on to offer particular examples of what entries in a waste book
        might look like.<a href="#fn38"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref38"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>38</sup></a> The mercantile waste book became
        a common motif and practice among figures such as Guido Pancirolli and
        Francis Bacon who were interested in the waste book as a mechanism for
        quickly noting doubtful knowledge in a repository that could be further
        tested over time. At a later stage, knowledge of a higher level of
        reliability might be extracted from it and inscribed in a more
        authoritative volume.<a href="#fn39"

           id="fnref39"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>39</sup></a> Elaine Leong has also noted a

    <p>In some parts of the manuscript, the author-practitioner’s approach
        differs substantially from standard recipe presentation. Making trials
        is a central feature of this manuscript. A frequent term we find in this
        manuscript is <em>essaye.</em> It appears in some form 40 times,
        compared to 10 uses for <em>experiment</em> or <em>experience</em>, and
        33 for <em>secret</em>.<a href="#fn41"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref41"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>41</sup></a> First-person narration also
        distances the manuscript from a standard collection of recipes. The
        first person occurs (in variations of <em>je</em>, <em>j’ay</em> and
        <em>j’en</em>), very conservatively, 130 times (not counting occasions
        when the pronoun was inferred from context, first-person possessive
        pronouns, etc).<a href="#fn42"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref42"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>42</sup></a> The first-person plural occurs
        more rarely; twice it refers to general categories, such as humans or
        Frenchmen, but two times it refers to a particular practice of a
        specific plural “we.”<a href="#fn43"
           class="footnote-ref"

    <p>The author-practitioner’s use of the first-person contributes greatly to
        the manuscript’s sense of immediacy, allowing us to feel as though we
        can follow along in the course of his trials. At the same time, these
        first-person accounts are not only of what he did or observed, but also
        of what he speculated, giving us clues to the author-practitioner’s
        practices of abstraction from sense experience. The phrase “I believe”
        (<em>je croy</em>) appears 15 times, “I don’t know if” (<em>je ne scay
            si</em>) 4 times, and “I think” (<em>je pense</em>) once. The phrase
        “I find that” (<em>je trouve que</em>) also appears four times; this
        phrase, to my ear, occurs at a more intermediate stage between sensual
        apprehension and more abstracted intellectual speculation, illustrating
        the range between forms of knowing more closely and more distantly
        entangled with bodily engagement. As Tillmann Taape discusses in his
        essay, “I find that” (<em>je trouve que</em>), as in the entry at fols.
        <a

           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/86r/f/86r/tl"><u>86r</u></a>,
        offers a relatively firm conclusion that the author-practitioner has
        drawn from repeated experience.<a href="#fn44"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref44"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>44</sup></a> He reports his findings, but
        does not speculate further about them until he adds, “I believe that
        [<em>je croy que</em>] the secret to cast well lies in finding a sand
        that receives the metal well, one for lead, the other for another, for
        each one has its particular one” (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/86r/f/86r/tl"><u>86r</u></a>).
    </p>
    <p>On the first occasion at which the first-person appears, “Painting
        <em>esmail d’azur</em> in oil” on (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/11r/f/11r/tl"><u>11r</u></a>),
        we find a progression loosely repeated in some, but by no means all,
        other entries. First, different views of others are collected (in this
        case, three different techniques). Then the author-practitioner offered
        his first person account of a trial of one of these techniques. It was
        good, but it had a drawback (“It loses a little of its vividness”). He
        then offered another technique that he had also tried to remedy this
        defect. At the very end of the entry, he reiterated, this time in the
        typical impersonal command voice of recipes, both the standard practice
        and his improved version. The author-practitioner has thus made explicit
        the process through which he generated a new recipe out of older ones,
        and he did so by recounting the sequence of his trials and retrials in
        the first person.</p>
    <p>Although not formalized, similar stages repeat elsewhere. One of the
        clearest examples of this progression appears on the second occasion of
        the use of the first person. “For whitening [cornaline]” (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/12v/f/12v/tl"><u>12v</u></a>–<a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/13r/f/13r/tl"><u>13r</u></a>)
        begins with considering the views of others, and continues to a
        speculation of a method (apparently not attempted), the detailed account
        of an attempt and its failure, and a successful retrial. It concludes
        with speculation concerning two variables in the process that it might
        be better to change in the future.</p>
    <p>One of the most speculative cases is that of the “work done in Algiers”
        (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/52r/f/52r/tl"><u>52r</u></a>),
        since this is for a phenomenon that the author-practitioner evidently
        did not succeed ultimately in producing, and perhaps had not yet even
        attempted, but about which he nevertheless recorded his speculations.
        These include speculation about what the original intent of a command in
        the recipe was and how it might be adapted to local conditions through
        effectuating the same intent through other means. Thus, the
        author-practitioner speculates how he might adapt the process for
        growing an alchemical silkworm in Algiers to a cooler climate by
        attempting to heighten the heat of the process, through the use of hot
        food or drink.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>I do not know if it would be good to water it [the horse]
            occasionally with water of sulfurous baths, &amp; to sometimes give
            it fenugreek or other hot foods, for the intention of the worker is
            <del>to it</del> to use the heat of its dung, &amp; the climate here
            is cooler than that of Algiers.</p>

    <p>The use of the first person is not consistent throughout the manuscript.
        The processes for casting are especially replete with first-person
        narration and self-reflexivity about success or failure, repeated
        trials, and speculation about alternative methods. This bears out Pamela
        Smith and Tonny Beentjes’ point concerning the particularly high level
        of experimentation and repeated trials in the sections on casting.<a

        “Casting in frames,” we find an explosion of 21 first-person pronouns
        (and far more if we include inferred pronouns), followed by a
        self-reflexive “Advice [<em>advertissement</em>] about the above.” The
        remarks in the <em>advertissement</em> suggest that there were times
        when our author-practitioner did not succeed as well as one might
        initially have supposed from the very coherent and detailed account of a
        series of complicated processes he had just given. He mentions the
        possibility of the sand shrinking in the frame, and warns that the cast
        must be thin, and that the sand cannot be reused for “molding <em>en
            noyau</em>.” These warnings suggest that such poor outcomes had
        occurred at various points to the author-practitioner as well,
        especially since this is only one of two <em>advertissements</em> that
        appear in the entire manuscript, the other one being also on the subject
        of casting (on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/115r/f/115r/tl"><u>115r</u></a>).
        We might gather from this that his account represented his perfected
        process following a series of trials and errors.</p>
    <p>Through his first-person usage, the author-practitioner takes access to
        hidden realms of knowledge into his own hands. As William Eamon has
        discussed, an air of mystery attached to even the most seemingly
        practical, printed, and widely available “how-to” collections of
        secrets. The impersonal commands of the recipe carried with it the
        history and authority of oracular pronouncements and mystery-cult
        initiations. Initiation into learning from a master remained alive and
        well both within the alchemical tradition and in guild rules and
        ceremonials. The author-practitioner himself makes reference to the
        relationship between books of secrets and Eleusinian mystery cults,
        defending his efforts to publicize his secrets against the charge that
        he profaned the Eleusinian goddesses.<a href="#fn50"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref50"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>50</sup></a></p>
    <p>The author-practitioner’s immediate engagement with religious ideas and
        experiences are both implicit in material process and explicit in the
        author-practitioner’s own symbolic interpretations of nature. For
        instance, the making of a linseed oil ointment against burns transforms
        dramatically along with the recitation of a number of paternosters
        specified in the recipe, as discovered by the Making and Knowing Project
        in reconstruction.<a href="#fn51"

           role="doc-noteref"><sup>51</sup></a></p>
    <p>At one point, the author-practitioner ruminated textually on what his
        direct confrontation with nature taught him about principles pertaining
        to moral and spiritual life. This passage is particularly significant
        because it occurs in the context of his trials concerning life-casting
        from snakes, the arena in which he was most self-reflexive. He notes how
        snakes, “when they want to bite or eat something, they do not bite with
        a direct attack, but with sinuous turns &amp; from the side, as
        do&nbsp;Satan&nbsp;&amp; his&nbsp;disciples.”&nbsp;Likewise, he
        continued in this symbolic vein to observe about the snake, “It has a
        small head, but a very long body. The entryway to sin seems small &amp;
        inconsequential, but the consequences of it are very great” (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/109v/f/109v/tl"><u>109v</u></a>).&nbsp;The
        intertwining of symbolic interpretation at the moment of the author’s
        greatest degree of self-reflexive, process-oriented literary
        technologies questions one popular Foucauldian account of the “thinning”
        of the modern world, that is, William Ashworth’s argument concerning the
        decline of emblematic views of nature.<a href="#fn52"

           id="fnref52"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>52</sup></a> The thickening of recipe
        practice through increased first-person narration and self-reflexivity

    <p>The next two manuscripts I will place on this spectrum come from the
        papers of Sir Theodore de Mayerne. The Huguenot royal physician at the
        early Stuart court, Mayerne might seem rather distant in time and place
        from the author-practitioner. However, Mayerne belonged to a dynasty
        committed to bridging artisanal and scholarly worlds in ways that
        intersected with the author-practitioner’s context. He is also being

    <p>In his letter to Roaldès, Louis Turquet championed mathematics as an aid
        to both the higher sciences and the mechanical arts. He reflected
        contemporary political theory that placed an emphasis not just on
        agriculture and trade, but on the patronage of domestic manufactures.
        Due to the neglect of mathematics, the higher sciences have become very
        uncertain and fallen into general disrepute (“en detestation generale”).
        But the mechanical arts have also suffered, so that the once honorable
        title of “mechanic” has become “a vile and abject epithet.”<a

        concerning “experience,” in the absence of other teachers, which
        according to the vulgar is the “mistress of the arts.” He argues that
        there is a shorter path, which is “the study and research of the
        sciences and arts and disciplines, and above all those of the
        mathematics. . . without which it is impossible to rise to the
        contemplation of spiritual and intelligible things nor to descend to
        those material and sensible.”<a href="#fn58"

        offered many practical suggestions for how to institutionalize forms of
        practical expertise for political benefit, including the patronage of
        manufactures.<a href="#fn60"

    <p>Mayerne’s background thus reflects the intersections of artisanal and
        learned cultures at the highest levels in the author-practitioner’s
        context. Roaldès and Béthune reflect, respectively, interest from the
        academic and political quarters of “reforming the world” by elevating
        the status of the mechanical arts and bringing them into the circuit of
        elite praxis. Mayerne himself turned to alchemy, rather than to
        mathematics as did his father, to build this bridge and reform the
        world.</p>
    <h2 id="sloane-3426">Sloane 3426</h2>
    <p>Sloane 3426 is a volume belonging to Mayerne and containing copies from

    <p>This manuscript begins with an account of creation, entitled
        “<em>Doctrine Generale</em>,” revealing the operations of principles of
        mercury and sulfur throughout the cosmos. It offered a defense of the
        “art of alchemy,” an art that was under attack during Mayerne’s time in
        Paris, and which he defended in print.<a href="#fn75"

           id="fnref75"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>75</sup></a> The <em>Doctrine Generale</em>
        was followed by a collection of recipes, many of them copied from other
        attributed sources, starting with iron (“Preparation de Mars”). In
        subject, these are chrysopoetic, medical, veterinary, culinary,
        horticultural, oeconomic (house-keeping), and craft-related, including
        recipes for making colors, varnishes, waxes, cements, and many recipes
        for gilding. There is also one practical joke: “To make it so that a cup
        sticks to the lips of one who drinks.”<a href="#fn76"

           id="fnref76"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>76</sup></a> This manuscript can thus be
        found simultaneously at two ends of a spectrum between the practical and
        the theoretical, with the highly specific recipes at one end (closer to
        Bordeaux 1213 than to Ms. Fr. Ms. 640), and the explicitly generalizing
        theory of the <em>Doctrine Generale</em> at the other.</p>
    <p>It is also equivocal in other ways. The first person appears, but far
        less frequently than in Ms. Fr. 640. In one case, an (unattributed)
        recipe made use of the first person. “For softening gold” includes the
        claim, “I made use of this composition very successfully.”<a

           id="fnref79"

    <p>The usage of the term <em>essay</em> is rare. It appears in one recipe
        for ink by Nicholas Briot, where one is instructed to “constantly test
        [<em>essayant tousiours</em>]” oak galls slowly boiling in wine, until
        the point when the ink is red when it dries. Mayerne, who made several
        corrections to this recipe throughout, noted at the bottom margin, “This
        ink never fades. Mr Briot senior. He thought a great deal of it.”
        Mayerne then offered his own version adjusting a few of its
        ingredients.<a href="#fn80"

    <p>The main text of the recipes themselves includes little self-reflexivity.
        Several recipes draw attention with an attributed note. A recipe for a
        “huile de Vitriol” includes a “Nota” signed by “R.” An “Oil of the
        Tincture of Antimony” has a note signed “Mutilet.”<a href="#fn81"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref81"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>81</sup></a> One recipe, “Pour la Rage,” for
        use on humans or animals suffering from rabies, is followed by an
        “Observation.” This records that “This receipt was practiced frequently
        by the Herberts of Orleans and by du Menil, the <em>maistre
            d’hostel</em> of the King, and it was also experimented frequently
        by Damain, on rational as well as irrational animals.”<a href="#fn82"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref82"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>82</sup></a> There are other, vaguer
        attestations. One “R” who appears throughout, claims that his
        “Attractive that must be applied on the top of the head … was proven by
        more than a thousand people, it works well for ophthalmology and
        recently two girls with the help of God recovered their sight which they
        had almost lost by using it.”<a href="#fn83"

           id="fnref83"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>83</sup></a></p>
    <p>In addition to the occasional note, observation, and Mayerne’s marginal
        annotations, the recipes sometimes include general principles or causal
        explanations. For instance, “R.” made the general statement, set off in
        a separate paragraph and larger letters as though it were the title of a
        recipe, “Every metal sublimed by the salt of mixts resolves later
        through cooling into an oil and finally through the fire coagulates into
        a stone.”<a href="#fn84"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref84"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>84</sup></a> Sometimes explanations for
        effects are offered in the course of a recipe; for instance, Mutillet’s
        method for distilling spirit of wine produced more quantity and of
        better quality than the ordinary method, he claimed, “because the salt
        and the tartar retain the phlegm and release the spirit, which they also
        fortify and improve.”<a href="#fn85"

           id="fnref85"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>85</sup></a></p>
    <p>Mayerne’s recipes, and his alone, include references to other named
        written texts. For instance, within his “Syrup purifying the blood,”
        Mayerne disagreed on dosage with “what Theophraste said in his treatise
        on Hellebore.”<a href="#fn86"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref86"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>86</sup></a> In “For the complicated hernia,”
        he referred to the method of [Jeremiah] Barth “in his commentaries on
        the Tyrocinium Chymicum of Beguin page 141.”<a href="#fn87"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref87"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>87</sup></a></p>
    <p>In Mayerne’s marginal notes, we also see evidence of some of his
        innovative practices of self-reflexivity, as well as the possessiveness
        of his personal intellectual property, marked often with a personal
        monogram. “Syrup purifying the blood” affords an especially interesting
        instance of self-reflexivity, since, after Mayerne copied his own recipe
        from Briot’s miscellany, he added a marginal historical note, identified
        with his monogram: “I once prescribed this syrup for Johann Martin, a
        Rosicrucian, the nephew of Mr. Briot. . . he took it for fifteen days. .
        .having been cured, he departed for Muscovy where he died.”<a
           href="#fn88"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref88"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>88</sup></a> This note suggests how for the
        physician Mayerne, some characteristics of the experimental essay, such
        as richness of detail, first-person accounts, and historical detail,
        were informed by the medical genre of the observation
        (<em>observatio</em>) and its use in the individual case report.<a

    <p>Further first-person notes are found around Mutillet’s “Excellent balm
        for wounds,” where Mayerne notes above it, “I had this balm. . . from
        Mr. Du Teil a physician of Geneva. It is very good. I made it.”<a
           href="#fn90"
           class="footnote-ref"

        the page is marked with Mayerne’s monogram and offers his suggested
        changes to the recipe, “I would prefer to impregnate the oil
        separately.”<a href="#fn91"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref91"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>91</sup></a> At other times, Mayerne uses the
        margin to remind himself to try a recipe with a different ingredient.
        Instead of one recipe for an extract of amber, involving several days of
        digestion within a strong spirit of wine, he reminds himself, “See if
        the amber, being also a liquid, couldn’t be dissolved in the oil of
        potiole or that of spike lavender to make a transparent and very drying
        varnish.”<a href="#fn92"

    <p>This manuscript is entitled “Experiments &amp; operations on matters of
        dyeing done by me M[ayerne]” (“Experiments &amp; operations en matiere
        de teincture faittes par moy M [monogram]”). It recounts Mayerne’s
        experimental labors over an eleven-year period (1639–1650). This work is
        much more luxuriously produced, with a great deal of glorious use of
        many different colors of ink, and formal mise-en-page, than the other
        three manuscripts. It obviously was not the notebook that Mayerne must
        have used to record his practice initially but was retrospectively
        written, likely over the course of many years. Despite its high finish,
        it does not appear to be intended for print.<a href="#fn93"

        broke away from the recipe mold. In this manuscript, Mayerne departs
        from recipes, and also invokes learned practices, more than the
        author-practitioner did. However, in other manuscripts, Mayerne records
        secrets in classic fashion, illustrating how he could employ or modify
        the genre of recipes as it suited him.<a href="#fn94"

        and semi-formalized methodical stages.</p>

        applies formal, self-critical categories to each “Essay,” including
        “censures” of his previous attempts, and “speculation to try”
        (“speculation à essayer”) for future ones. He offers reminders, or
        <em>nota benes</em>, to himself. He cross-references to printed works,

        dyeing thread red with brazilwood. The entry concludes with “It is good”
        (“Bona est”) and “I made it” (“feci”), and a further note about how
        thread absorbs color in the case of cochineal. He does not mark these
        comments with his monogram.</p>
    <p>The next recipe, also in Latin, was for dyeing on silk using cochineal
        and gamboge. This was in part a failure, which offered an opportunity
        for intensive self-reflexivity. Mayerne entitled this entry, “A chance
        dye, almond flower-colored. On taffeta. bizarre but beautiful, notable
        for its production of mixtures: not able to be imitated because of the
        work. It is futile to do more, etc.”<a href="#fn98"

        <p>The alumed did better, and while it was still wet it had an
            unpleasant purplish redness, but once dried, it became the color of
            almond flowers, or the color of flesh that is a bit brown. A

        a “bizarre” color, his assistant, the professional dyer Fletcher,
        thought a lot of it and said that merchants would value it highly. This
        represents an otherwise unattested use of the term “pink” as a pale
        reddish color in the period, as ordinarily pink in the seventeenth
        century denoted a yellow.<a href="#fn100"

    <p>He frequently exhorted himself, especially following a failed attempt,
        with commands and commonplaces. For instance, at one point he notes,
        “Cook, cook, cook, and do not weary.” Versions of this were a command

        a few proverbs in various languages. These included forms of

        and injunctions to secrecy. For instance, in an account of one faulty

    <p>While constantly and clearly identifying his authorship and the time and
        place of each essay, Mayerne also ventriloquized, as an exhortation to
        himself, the sonorous admonitions of the ancients. Such quotations, in
        the first case, stemmed from alchemical literature. They also recall
        Montaigne’s weaving together of quotations in his <em>Essays</em>,
        ironically using commonplaces as a vehicle in which to locate the self.
    </p>
    <p>Mayerne personalized his work still further than did the
        author-practitioner, particularly through his possessive monogram. His
        unusual use of commonplaces to exhort himself towards the proper mindset
        for experimentation personalized and interiorized experimental labor is
        a form of “ego document.”<a href="#fn118"

        a part of the depersonalization of knowledge, but it was not. Mayerne’s
        process of documenting failure was more self-critical, formal and
        stadial process of documenting failure than that of the
        author-practitioner. This might be explained in part by the fact that
        the author-practitioner may have intended his work for publication.
        Mayerne’s work, for all the glamour of its multi-colored inks and formal
        mise-en-page, seems destined for domestic and mostly personal
        consultation.</p>
    <p>On a spectrum between recipes and experimental essays, we might order
        these four manuscripts thus: Bordeaux Ms. 1213, Sloane 3426 , Ms. Fr.
        640, and Sloane 3423. This is not a simple progression. As we noted,
        Sloane 3426 is ambivalent in many ways, with different recipe authors
        varying in their usage of the first-person, of causal explanations, and
        of references to printed works. In general, however, both Ms. Fr. 640
        and Sloane 3423 emphasize the first person and the practice of trial, or
        <em>essay</em>, far more than was common in recipe collections,
        commonplace collections, or books of secrets in the period. They
        participate in the general preference for first-person narration,
        self-reflexivity, experimentation, and speculation found in essay
        writing in the period in general. The use of the first person functions
        more to situate the account as the questionable practice of a particular
        individual rather than to assert its truth or efficacy. These texts
        might be better categorized as collections of experimental essays.</p>
    <h2 id="conclusion-thickness-doubt-and-bacons-method">Conclusion: Thickness,
        Doubt, and Bacon’s Method</h2>
    <p>The evolution of the experimental essay from the recipe bears
        implications for the nature of early modern experimental knowledge, the
        manner in which it emerged, and what it might have to suggest to us
        about contemporary scientific rhetorical practice. Personalizing
        knowledge, and making clear what the steps were in producing it in a
        particular time and place, situated knowledge as the product of
        individuals. Personalization thus offered greater tools for query and
        doubt than those afforded by texts appearing in an impersonal,
        omniscient voice. Rather than increasing claims of certainty, we see in
        the experimental rhetoric that developed over the course of the
        sixteenth and seventeenth centuries an increase in uncertainty.
        Characteristics of the emerging experimental essay that responded to
        such uncertainty might include adaptability to unexpected outcomes,
        tentative and probabilistic claims, and increasingly formalized and
        sophisticated mechanisms for doubting.</p>
    <p>As Porter has discussed, large-scale narratives about the thinning of
        modern scientific knowledge link certainty to an impersonal method. For
        Bacon, as generally in the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries,
        method primarily meant textual techniques for storing, arranging,
        accessing and transmitting knowledge, rather than a particular series of
        cognitive processes or forms of argumentation.<a href="#fn119"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref119"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>119</sup></a> Above all, the term method in
        the late sixteenth and early seventeenth century connoted a Ramist
        dichotomous chart, a shortcut to knowledge organization and
        visualization that could be utilized in any form of textually-based
        knowledge, no matter the epistemology. Ramist dichotomous charts were
        the antithesis of the essay; they were purposefully extremely systematic
        and impersonal, thinned knowledge that could efficiently mechanize the
        process of pedagogy.</p>
    <p>Bacon, however, opposed this thinned-down, impersonal method, which he
        termed a “magistral” method in opposition to his own suggestion of an
        “initiatory method.” By adopting these two terms of <em>magister</em>
        and initiate, Bacon intervened in the mystery-cult dynamic upon which
        recipe culture was based, as well as in current Ramist pedagogical
        practices. The “magistral” method presented knowledge in the omniscient,
        unquestionable voice of the master. The initiatory method, Bacon
        claimed, denied the authority of the teacher who presented knowledge as
        though it were already known, forefronting instead the ability of the
        student to ask critical questions.</p>
    <p>We might relate this to the use that the author-practitioner and Mayerne
        made of the command voice. Commands in the recipe tradition, such as
        <em>recipe</em> (“take”) itself, appear in an authoritative voice that
        does not make clear what doubts and failures might exist within the
        recipe—even if such recipes are attributed and users do not hesitate to
        scribble questions and criticisms in the margins all around. The
        author-practitioner and Mayerne sometimes use the command voice in a
        different fashion, that is, as a reminder to themselves of speculative
        other ingredients and processes to try in the future. This use of the
        command is, as it were, the initiate taking charge and personalizing the
        command to themselves; it is a mode more explicitly probabilistic and
        uncertain about future success compared to the typical commands found in
        recipes.</p>
    <p>As a mechanism allowing the student to question knowledge by tracing the
        course of its development, Bacon suggested thickening knowledge with the
        particular details of its origins. Bacon “compared the magistral method
        to the piling of dead wood,” because it offered cleaned building
        material, efficiently prepared for building storehouses of knowledge and
        for transmission.<a href="#fn120"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref120"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>120</sup></a> This is what we might call, in
        Porter’s terms, thinned knowledge. Bacon complained that such
        pre-packaged lumber, by wiping away the messy dirt around the roots,
        that is, all the subjective, local, questionable and failed
        characteristics of knowledge trials, prevented the future growth of
        knowledge. Better to start small, with the incipient little shoots with
        their dirt still clinging to them, and grow knowledge step by step.
        Developing literary technologies with the dirt still on means thickening
        and personalizing.</p>
    <p>This was precisely what the author-practitioner did. The increasing
        personalization we encountered in the manuscripts of the
        author-practitioner and Mayerne would be surprising if we expected a
        thinning of knowledge away from a thick, local embodiment. However, such
        personalization is not surprising if we expect a shift in the meaning of
        experiment from general experience to a particular event.<a

        that how-to literature slowly evolved to become more personalized and
        historicized as tacit knowledge gradually was rendered increasingly

        form of limited, probabilistic speculation developed through adaptive,
        reiterative experimentation, grew out of such developing literary
        technologies and not the other way around.</p>
    <p>The increasing personalization of how-to texts in the early modern period
        can be set in the social context of an entrepreneurial trading zone, in
        which artisanal figures made overtures to more textually-based
        scholarship and vice versa. Ursula Klein has described a process of
        depersonalization of craft expertise at the end of the eighteenth
        century (one arena in which this occurred was the eighteenth-century
        Lyon silk industry founded two centuries earlier by the Turquet family).
        However, according to Klein, that development followed an increase in a
        variety of new roles and crafts in which individuals could claim
        personal mastery; these figures “were neither ordinary craftsmen nor
        traditional scholars,” writes Klein. “Like scholars, they were familiar
        with textual traditions as well as mathematical and graphical
        representations; but, like craftsmen, they actively participated in the
        world of labor in addition to their contacts with, or even citizenship
        in, the Republic of Letters.”<a href="#fn125"

    <p>Prior to eighteenth-century depersonalization, the sixteenth and
        seventeenth centuries offered a period of often idiosyncratic
        inventiveness, as individuals departed from the ancient genre of the
        recipe in different ways. This comparison of four manuscripts highlights
        the innovations of Ms. Fr. 640 within this snowballing stream of
        creatively diversifying textual practices. A thousand flowers bloomed
        when it came to creative ways to document experimental knowledge in the
        early modern period. Much more research remains to be done in unearthing
        this diversity and making a case for what it says about the emergence of
        new scientific genres and what it might have to suggest for current
        scientific rhetorical practices.</p>
    <p>Not all of the innovations of the author-practitioner, or Mayerne, or
        Bacon, or of the many others who took pen to paper to document their
        trials in the period would continue on in the future. One aspect of
        early modern experimental practices which has noticeably dropped away
        over the intervening centuries is the use of first-person narration in
        scientific articles, which rely instead upon heavy citation as a means
        for attaching knowledge to the viewpoints of individuals in particular
        times and places. Authors of scientific journal articles, like
        researchers in other fields, often follow a convention of using
        passive-voice constructions in ways that appear to suggest a thin
        objectivity and replicability. The use of the impersonal voice in
        scientific journals has declined in recent years,with some journals
        calling for an increased use of the first person.<a href="#fn126"

        history of experimental rhetoric has never relied upon a single
        transition from thick to thin, and from the personally subjective to the
        impersonally objective. In praise of what we might call the “thickness”
        of a personal essay in contrast to the thinness of information overload
        and scattered attention, the essayist Scott Russell Saunders wrote,</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>In this era of prepackaged thought the essay is the closest thing we
            have, on paper, to a record of the individual mind at work and play.
            . . Feeling overwhelmed by data, random information, the flotsam and
            jetsam of mass culture, we relish the spectacle of a single
            consciousness making sense of a part of the chaos.<a href="#fn128"
