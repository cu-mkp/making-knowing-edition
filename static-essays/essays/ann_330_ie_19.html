    <p>Where might we be able to situate our anonymous author-practitioner
        between a world of craftspeople and that of scholars? The
        author-practitioner himself gives us some clues about where he lies
        between the workshop and the scholarly study, most of all by suggesting
        that he may have intended to title a possible planned book <em>The
            Workshop</em> (<em>La Boutique</em>). But the story of his
        relationship with the learned world is not as simple as it might seem at
        first.</p>
    <p>In the notes the author-practitioner drew up seemingly for a preface for
        this possible public work, he reaches out to his audience. Here, he
        promises to expose the material knowledge of his workshop to what seems
        to be a version of the Republic of Letters, that is, an imagined country
        in which scholars reached across national and religious boundaries to
        share their knowledge through an exchange of texts. This was typically
        known in Latin as a commerce of letters (<em>commercium
            literarium</em>), which is how the author-practitioner characterizes
        his own activities.<a href="#fn1"

    <blockquote>
        <p>As small peddlers lay open small wares in order to buy richer ones
            &amp; to profit more and more, so I, from a desire to learn, am
            exposing what little is in my workshop to <del>have it</del>
            receive, through a common commerce of letters, much rarer secrets
            from my benevolent readers (fol. <a
               href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/162r/f/162r/tl"><u>162r</u></a>).
        </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>While the author-practitioner presents
        himself as a willing participant in a commerce of letters, he also
        begins to hint at a somewhat aggressive attitude towards the world of
        learning that can be found in books. In his analogy of offering his
        wares for sale, the author-practitioner explicitly hopes to cheat the
        reader, obtaining something far more valuable from his readers than the
        wares he sold them.</p>
    <p>This might appear to be over-reading the typical praise for the knowledge
        of the audience to be expected in prefaces addressed to readers at the
        time. Yet, the author-practitioner goes on to develop an antagonistic
        attitude towards the world of textual learning, particularly that found
        in formal academic settings, by attacking the <em>Tablet of Cebes,</em>
        a popular educational text<em>.</em> He describes the content of his
        book as scorned by others; just as “the hen carefully searches the
        garbage thrown out of a house for a crumb or a grain that she divides
        among her chicks, thus one distributes to orphans that which has been
        sought among the arts considered vile &amp; abject” (fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/166r/f/166r/tl"><u>166r</u></a>).
        The author-practitioner has acted as the hen, gathering, through a
        careful search, parts of the arts despised by others but valued by his
        audience of “orphans.” He goes on to note, “Tablet of Cebes, idle, but
        the workshop represents all things active” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/166r/f/166r/tl"><u>166r</u></a>).
    </p>
    <p>How should we interpret this contrast between his representation of “all
        things active” and the idleness of the <em>Tablet of Cebes</em>? The
        <em>Tablet of Cebes</em> was an ancient text of the first or second
        century CE that describes in words and interprets an image of a journey
        up a mountain supposedly once deposited in an ancient temple. The tablet
        itself is lost, if it ever existed, and thus represents one of many of
        the lost objects of antiquity that the author-practitioner discusses.<a

           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref2"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
    <p>The text describing the images on the tablet was hugely popular during
        the author-practitioner’s lifetime, and it was often depicted in prints
        and paintings; it also gave rise to many other ways of portraying
        knowledge in similarly hierarchical terms (<i><u>Fig. 1</u></i>).<a

                version, the mechanical arts (<em>artes mechanicae</em>),
                symbolized by figures spinning, chopping wood, and working at a
                forge, are located surprisingly deep within the structure of
                learning, within the second wall to the right. They have not yet
                begun the ascent to more abstract knowledge, however. Permalink:

    <p>The <em>Tablet of Cebes</em> portrays the development of a human, as the
        individual passes through several levels of a hierarchical education. At
        the start of the journey, the student must distinguish between the world
        of the body and its desires, which must be left behind at the very start
        of their academic journey, and the realm of philosophical contemplation,
        a higher wisdom (“<em>sapience</em>”), which was their ultimate goal.
        The seeker of wisdom in the <em>Tablet of Cebes</em> must pass through
        three gates. First, they must choose bodily virtue. Only then could they
        enter the second gate, where they might choose the path of intellectual
        virtue. In some ways, the <em>Tablet of Cebes</em> supported the role of
        the mechanical arts on the path to knowledge. After all, they are part
        of the journey, and in fact, found surprisingly far along the path to
        knowledge, within the second inner wall, in the same circle as the
        liberal arts (<i><u>Fig. 2</u></i>). However, both the liberal and the
        mechanical arts must be left behind for the student to ascend to the
        mountain’s top.</p>

    <p>By saying that the <em>Tablet of Cebes</em> was “idle” and his
        <em>Boutique</em> was active, the author-practitioner countered one of
        the central claims of the <em>Tablet of Cebes</em>, that the mountainous
        path to philosophical speculation was more rigorous than the forms of
        knowledge practiced on the planes below. The <em>Tablet of Cebes</em>
        suggested that not everyone could endure the harsh, continually uphill
        process of shedding an attachment to material things. The
        author-practitioner recast this detachment as idleness. The voyager
        abandoned the arts as though they were less valuable than idle
        speculation. The author-practitioner, like the diligent mother hen,
        carefully picked up what others did not value.</p>
    <p>The author-practitioner was not alone in critiquing the model of pedagogy
        that the <em>Tablet of Cebes</em> promoted. His contemporary, Michel de
        Montaigne (1533–1592), in an essay on the education of children, also
        did so. The goal of education, Montaigne wrote, was <em>vertue</em>, a
        term that is difficult to translate, more connected with bodily vigor
        and ability than with the piety that the term <em>virtue</em> connotes
        today. This enjoyable and courageous <em>vertue</em> was not to be found
        at the top of a craggy and inaccessible mountain, but on a beautiful,
        flowering plain. While pedagogues strictly disciplined their students,
        denying them the ability to follow the path of their desires,
        <em>vertue</em> was the enemy of fear and constraint. <em>Vertue</em>
        had nature as its guide and fortune and bodily pleasure as its
        companions.<a href="#fn4"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref4"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
    <p>Unlike the mountainous landscape of the <em>Tablet of Cebes,</em> the
        author-practitioner did not situate the <em>Boutique</em> along a
        hierarchy of knowledge. The <em>Boutique</em> offered a form of
        universal workshop in which many different forms of experimentation and
        craft practice intermingled.<a href="#fn5"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref5"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> As was the case for Montaigne’s
        <em>vertue</em>, in this pleasant plane of instruction, nature acted as
        the guide.<a href="#fn6"
