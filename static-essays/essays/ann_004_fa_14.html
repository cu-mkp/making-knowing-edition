        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <div>
            <p>Despite the quantity, detail, and breadth of entries about
                metalworking in Ms. Fr. 640, most instructions for casting
                presume that the object to be cast—usually medals, animals, or
                plants—already exists. The entries thus very rarely address the
                fabrication of the original pattern for making the mold. Medals
                are frequently reproduced or made in serial production in Ms.
                Fr. 640, but the actual procedure for making that first model is
                left mostly unmentioned. This essay investigates the few
                instances in the manuscript for creating patterns, including
                fols. <a

    <p>Despite the great number of detailed entries related to metalworking in
        Ms. Fr. 640 and the breadth of their subjects, most of the manuscript’s
        instructions for casting start in reproducing an already-existing
        object, rather than from the creation of a pattern or model. For the
        life casting of animals and plants, this is self-explanatory because the
        pattern is a natural thing, but for medals, which need the creation of a
        pattern carved or modeled from wood, wax, or other material, this is
        noteworthy, and may provide clues to the genesis and authorship of the
        manuscript. While the focus on practical advice in the manuscript may
        suggest that it was written in the context of a practicing artisan’s
        workshop, the metalworking descriptions most often involve replication,
        and very rarely address the making of an original object. While
        reproducibility or serial production is an important feature of medal
        making,<a href="#fn1"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref1"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> in Ms. Fr. 640, whether the
        “original” was used for direct (single mold) or indirect (piece mold)
        casting,<a href="#fn2"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref2"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> the actual procedure for making
        that first model is rarely mentioned. This essay investigates the few
        instances in the manuscript for making original patterns. Among the
        questions this essay seeks to address are: what materials were used to
        make these patterns, and what are the techniques for fabricating them?
        Were they carved, drawn, or modeled? How and with what tools? Our
        research into patterns in Ms. Fr. 640 also seeks to provide insight into
        the identity of the author-practitioner.<a href="#fn3"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref3"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> What does the lack of
        instructions about how to make patterns for casting allow us to conclude
        about the author-practitioner’s occupation and his areas of expertise.
        Were the techniques of carving or creating models so widely known that
        they did not bear mentioning? Or did divisions of labor mean that the
        artisan who created an original pattern was not the same person who
        reproduced objects? What position would the author-practitioner of Ms.
        Fr. 640 have held within such a system of divided labor and knowledge?

    </h2>
    <p>The recipe “Wax for seal and imprint” (<em>Cire a cachet et
            empraincte</em>) on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/42r/f/42r/tl"><u>42r</u></a>
        includes directions for making wax that is soft enough to take
        impressions, which instructs to keep wax in tepid water and knead it.
        The author-practitioner writes, “press [<em>empraindras</em>] it into
        whatever you want.” Since this recipe is about making seals, the wax
        itself will not be cast but instead will only take an impression, so
        this is not quite a description of how to make a pattern for casting.
        However, the recipe also suggests carving: “You can carve the figures
        [<em>tailler les figures</em>] &amp; gild them, silver them, &amp; paint
        them with colors in varnish.” Randle Cotgrave provides a contemporary
        definition of <em>tailler</em> as “to cut, slit, slice, hew, hack,
        slash, gash; nicke, snip, notch, indent; carve, [en]grave; also, to
        gueld, or spey; also to tax, impose taxes on, levie tributes of.”<a
           href="#fn4"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref4"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> The term is related to
        <em>intaglio</em> processes, which Benvenuto Cellini alludes to in
        passages about engraving.<a href="#fn5"

           id="fnref5"

        Ms. Fr. 640 refers to <em>Tailleurs en planches</em> (Cutters of
        printing plates), but fol. 42r contains the only use of <em>tailler</em>
        in the sense of carving a model. The verb is more often used in the
        context of cutting stone or other materials.<a href="#fn6"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref6"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
    <p>Although carving is not much discussed in Ms. Fr. 640, “modeling” or
        “roughing out” forms for other fabrication processes is. “For adorning
        beds, mirrors, and suchlike” on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/131r/f/131r/tl"><u>131r</u></a>
        instructs, “Rough out some design [<em>Esbaulche sur une ardoise bien
            unye quelque desseing</em>] in half relief on a quite flat slate to
        adapt it to either round or flat things. And having cast it in mixed
        tin, quite thin, you can gild it with gold leaf &amp; adapt it to
        whatever you want.” Cotgrave defines the verb <em>esbaucher</em> as “To
        rough-hew; grossely to frame, forme, square, or cut out of the whole
        peece; to begin rudely, any peece of work; also, to pruine a tree; and,
        in painting, to tricke.”<a href="#fn7"

           id="fnref7"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
    <p>“Cast of wax to represent an animal that one has not got” (<em>Gect en
            cire pour representer lanimal quon na point</em>) on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/139v/f/139v/tl"><u>139v</u></a>
        describes a procedure for making a stiff white wax, sometimes called
        <em>esbaucher</em> wax. The title of the recipe appears promising for
        our research, since if “one has not got” the animal that one wishes to
        cast, then one’s recourse would be to carve a model for it. But the
        focus of the recipe is on the production of a modeling material that is
        “firm” (<em>ferme</em>), rather than on a discussion of the actual
        process of modeling or working that material. Nonetheless, the
        author-practitioner does make certain recommendations about casting that
        have to do with an ability to check one’s work, such as adding charcoal
        “The charcoal gives color <sup>and body</sup> to the wax, which would
        otherwise be transparent &amp; the features would not be seen as well.”
        The note to the left of this recipe also begins, “This black sulfured
        wax is for modeling [<em>pour esbaucher</em>] round figures that are not
        for releasing and that one needs to burn in the mold <em>à noyau</em>
        before opening it, <em>
            <del>po</del>
        </em> like those which have arms &amp; legs out front or entwined.” Like
        on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/131r/f/131r/tl"><u>131r</u></a>,
        the word <em>esbaucher</em> suggests a technique of fabrication that
        goes beyond replication.</p>
    <p><em>Esbaucher</em> appears again on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/124/f/124v/tl"><u>124v</u></a>
        under the heading “Casting with gold,” and refers there to molds that
        have “cost a lot to model in wax” [<em>couste beaucoup a esbaucher en
            cire</em>].<a href="#fn8"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref8"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> Similarly, fol. 109r contains a
        recipe titled “Modeling in wax” [<em>Esbaucher en cire</em>], which,
        again, is about making hard wax “more amiable.” While none of these
        recipes explicitly describes the process of modeling in wax once it has
        been made workable, one can conclude that the reason for making wax
        malleable is to work it into a pattern for casting.</p>
    <p>Further evidence can be found in “Molding promptly and reducing a hollow
        form to a relief” [<em>Mouler prompteme{n}t et reduire un cave en
            relief</em>] on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/156r/f/156r/tl"><u>156r</u></a>.
        It begins with the instruction: “You can imprint [<em>empraindre</em>]
        the relief of a medal in colored wax, &amp; you will have a hollow
        form.”<a href="#fn9"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref9"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> Again, the author-practitioner
        already has a pattern (the medal) as his starting point. Interestingly,
        <em>empraindre</em> is also used in the recipe on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/42r/f/42r/tl"><u>42r</u></a>,
        discussed above in relation to <em>tailler</em>. In that instance the
        author-practitioner describes the preferred type of wax and a technique
        for making such a negative imprint of a metal relief in the wax. On fol.
        156r, this step is not explicitly explained but is either assumed as
        common knowledge or, perhaps, as sufficiently described earlier in the
        manuscript. That further on in the instructions on fol. 42r, carving
        [<em>tailler</em>] this wax impression is mentioned may indicate
        alterations to the design being made, or flaws in the imprint being
        corrected.</p>
    <p>“Molding” on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/50r/f/50r/tl"><u>50r</u></a>
        is similar in that it does not discuss producing <em>original</em>
        patterns, but rather explains how to create the impression of an
        existing object for subsequent casting:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>If you want to promptly mold something in half relief that comes to
            hand, fold some paper in five or six doubles, &amp; place it on the
            medal &amp; make sure the paper is folded on the back of the medal
            so that it is well secured. Next, take a stick, broad at one end
            &amp; pointed at the other, well softened, and rub well on the
            paper, &amp; with the point of the stick retrace the lines &amp;
            proceed until you recognize that your imprint is well done. Then, at
            your convenience, slightly rub oil with a paintbrush <em>
                <del>lemp</del>
            </em> on the paper imprint and cast in tallow or wax or sulfur,
            &amp; the paper, without burning, will render your portrait neat,
            which you will afterward be able to mold in plaster or tripoli, and
            then in lead &amp; other metal.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>Here the author-practitioner, as on fol.
        <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/42r/f/42r/tl"><u>42r</u></a>,
        describes a process of lifting an impression from a medal that already
        exists, in this case, including careful registration of the paper on the
        pattern (“well-secured”). Even more significantly, this recipe also
        provides the procedure—albeit in an abbreviated manner—for moving from a
        model to a mold: the model is impressed into paper, which is then used
        as a negative mold for a casting material (tallow, wax, or sulfur); this
        casting material is poured into the paper as a positive, and then used
        to form a negative mold in plaster or tripoli, which results finally in
        a positive “in lead &amp; other metal.” The terse last two sentences of
        this recipe provide as clear a set of step-by-step instructions for
        casting from a model as almost any other recipe in the manuscript.<a

    <p>Ms. Fr. 640 does not appear to contain detailed information about
        creating original patterns, instead addressing the topic only
        fleetingly. Whether this is because the author-practitioner presumed
        this aspect of fabrication was well known, or because those instructions
        fell outside of the scope of the author-practitioner’s expertise or
        interests is a motivating question of this essay. A comparison of the
        few explicit descriptions of creating a model in Ms. Fr. 640 to
        contemporary authors is informative.</p>
    <p>In a controverted passage in Benvenuto Cellini’s <em>Autobiography</em>
        describing the making of a pattern, Ms. Fr. 640 may even shed light on
        the process. Cellini writes, “During this man’s illness the Duke sent
        for me, and bade me take his portrait; this I did upon [<em>innun</em>]
        a circular piece of black stone about the size of a little trencher.”<a

        <em>innun</em> is the source of controversy—does it mean “in” or “on”?

        <em>on</em> the black stone, using it as a working surface to make a wax
        model for a seal such as in <i><u>Fig. 1</u></i>?<a href="#fn12"

    <p>By far the most informative of sixteenth-century sources on the making of
        original patterns is Cellini’s <em>Treatises</em>. Cellini writes about
        a number of materials and provides instructions for making patterns with
        them, including steel (for numismatic dies), black wax<a href="#fn13"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref13"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> and white wax (in relation to
        which he describes the making of sand molds), and carving directly into
        silver.<a href="#fn14"

           id="fnref14"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
    <p>Cellini advises softening steel for engraving under fire then leaving it
        overnight covered in “a concoction made of earth, powdered glass, soot
        from the chimney, and bole of Armenia [with] a little horse-dung [and
        formed into] a paste with man’s urine.”<a href="#fn15"

        coin.<a href="#fn16"

    <p>Regarding patterns in white wax, Cellini writes,</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>The first thing to be done is to make a model in white wax of the
            head, the reverse, and whatever there may be, to the exact size and

    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>The description of making a model in white
        wax given here is unsurprising, but the fact that Cellini includes this
        step in his narrative—and that he connects it to ancient
        practices—differentiates his text from Ms. Fr. 640. The other
        peculiarity in Cellini’s passage “About Medals,” is that it includes
        instructions for making tools, the <em>taselli</em>, evidently for
        reproducing the medals but also for fabricating monetary coins. This
        raises questions as to whether the distinction between coins
        [<em>monete</em>] and medals [<em>medaglie</em>] is simply functional.
        He also recommends that “you will do well to make wax impressions from
        time to time, while you are cutting, to see how you are getting on,”
        similar to his suggestion for periodically testing the steel dies by
        using tin.<a href="#fn19"

    <p>Vannoccio Biringuccio’s comments on reproducing medals also provide
        information about workshop practices that go unmentioned in Ms. Fr. 640
        and in Cellini’s <em>Treatises</em>. In explaining the the making of
        sand molds, Biringuccio writes, “It [the sand and magistry discussed in
        the preceding text] also served me very well in that one, two, three, or
        four casts were made without having to mould it again, if the relief
        that was moulded was not very great.”<a href="#fn20"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref20"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> Two significant implications are
        evident from this sentence: first, that in processes of sand casting,
        the same mold was indeed intended to produce several identical casts;
        and, second, that for medals, the number of times a mold could be used
        was apparently related to its size and/or the depth of its relief.</p>
    <p>The pseudonymous Alessio Piemontese’s recipe “To imprint medalles in
        hoste [haste?] with Dragagant,” after explaining how to make a paste
        that would harden and could be used for casting, concludes with the
        suggestion, “And of this paste you maie make also other workes as you
        will, as Beades, stones, or other.”<a href="#fn21"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref21"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a> This suggests similar questions
        to those raised by Ms. Fr. 640, namely, why, if the author-practitioner
        suggests that other objects besides already-existing medals can be cast
        using this method, he chose not to expand his directions for making
        medals to encompass creating one’s own pattern.</p>
    <h2 id="materials-for-making-patterns">Materials for Making Patterns</h2>
    <p>What little information Ms. Fr. 640 does provide on making original
        patterns adds to the documented research on the materials in which
        patterns were made. John R. Spencer follows George F. Hill’s series of
        articles on early modern medals, in assuming that the patterns for
        Italian Renaissance medals were uniformly cast from wax.<a href="#fn22"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref22"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a> Patricia Tuttle acknowledges
        that sulfur may have been used in the casting process but suggests that
        its use was as a material for making negative molds rather than for the
        positive form of a pattern.<a href="#fn23"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref23"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a> The addition of sulfur,
        especially, to the materials used for casting implies that a different
        set of tools for melting (since wax can be cast into sulfur but not vice
        versa) and almost certainly a different set of materials for molds might
        have been used. The melting point of beeswax, 144°F, is much lower than
        that of sulfur, at approximately 240°F (and that of tallow at around
        113°F), which would make a sulfur mold suitable to use with molten wax
        or tallow. That pure wax was used as a pattern, and especially that
        medals were created using a lost-wax casting technique, appears to be an
        outdated conception of the process of making medals.<a href="#fn24"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref24"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
    <p>Instead, scholarly opinion has shifted toward an understanding that sand
        molding was the primary method of fabrication. Partly because of the
        pressure necessary for impressing a pattern into sand, and the relative
        melting points and temperatures achieved during the steps of the casting
        process, a workable material harder than wax would have been ideal. On
        this point, Biringuccio gives plaster as an example: “It is also
        customary to make a plaster capable of being worked easily by hand in
        making medallion portraits… in bas-relief so that they can be moulded
        for making them in bronze if you wish.” He also gives several
        alternatives to plaster, including white wax mixed with white lead and
        tallow; plasters with gums, wax, “Greek pitch or ship’s tar;” soap;
        “sulphur and brick dust, or two parts of Grecian pitch and one of
        wax.”<a href="#fn25"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref25"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a> That all of these are viable
        materials for making a pattern that could produce, as Biringuccio
        writes, “multiple casts without having to mold it again” suggests that
        the scholarly assumption that medals began as carved wax models renders
        an incomplete image not only of the variety of substances used in
        fabrication but also of the ingenuity of the fabricators.</p>
    <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>In general, processes of making patterns for casting are largely absent
        from Ms. Fr. 640. How to interpret that omission, however, is not
        readily apparent. The author-practitioner does seem to presume a fair
        amount of knowledge on the part of his audience, signaled by phrases
        such as “as you know” or “you know how to….” even when there are no
        entries in the previous folios describing these processes.<a

           id="fnref26"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a> The author-practitioner may have
        omitted instructions for fabricating a pattern because he assumed that
        part of the making process was unnecessary to describe, since any artist
        could go about it in whatever way he or she chose. Furthermore, the
        recipes collected in Ms. Fr. 640 mostly detail casting procedures that
        can be replicated with some precision. The act of carving materials is a
        particular learned skill that also depends on individual creativity,
        which the manuscript’s author-practitioner may have realized falls
        outside of the scope of the type of knowledge that he aimed to transmit,
        or that could be transmitted in a text.<a href="#fn27"

    <p>Finally, we return to the questions posed in the introduction to this
        essay. The most challenging of these is the identity of the
        author-practitioner of the manuscript. From the evidence gathered here,
        we propose that the author-practitioner’s focus was on
        <em>reproducing</em> medals and other objects and not creating entirely
        new objects to be cast. Our investigation does not give insight into the
        trade practiced by the author-practitioner. In this context, however, it
        is instructive to compare other late sixteenth- and early
        seventeenth-century individuals whom we know produced, wrote about, or
        collected medals (or possessed knowledge about them). On one end of such
        a spectrum lies the practical knowledge of an artisan, such as a founder
        or, slightly farther along, a goldsmith like Cellini, while on the other
        end we might place the more or less learned approach of the savant or
        <em>amateur</em>, for instance, a compiler of “secrets” or “recipes,”
        and, further along the continuum, a more “passive” collector and
        contemplator of medals.</p>
    <p>The author-practitioner’s interest in and detailed descriptions of many
        things in fields other than casting and metalworking indicates
        wide-ranging interests, but the manuscript entries about mold making and
        metalworking may still provide important clues. His interest in and
        description of all parts of the casting process that deal with making
        molds suggests that he was not merely a founder. We know that Cellini
        was a practitioner who related his practical experience through texts
        and could point to products of his craft. And, we may also look to Hugh
        Plat as a counterexample, a compiler of instructions for various
        procedures who did not necessarily have any expertise himself.<a
           href="#fn28"

           id="fnref28"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
    <p>Another interesting example to consider is the Dutch polymath and
        nobleman Constantijn Huygens, who is known not only to have collected
        medals but also to have (re)produced them around 1628.<a href="#fn29"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref29"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a> While Huygens’s education and
        level in society remove him further from artisans than the less socially
        elite Hugh Plat, his hands-on experience blurs such divisions. As
        historian A. R. E de Heer notes, the benefit of Huygens’s medal-making
        adventures, according to his autobiography, was threefold: first, it
        demonstrated his talent, and, as such, was cause for praise and respect
        among his peers; second, he demonstrated that he was skilled enough
        that, if ever necessary, he could earn a living through manual labor;
        and, third, his practical understanding and knowledge of medals provided
        the foundation for proper judgment of such objects.<a href="#fn30"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref30"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
    <p>Significantly, Huygens possessed a brief handwritten treatise concerning
        metal casting containing a similar structure and style of written
        recipes to Ms. Fr. 640 that explains the various processes of molding
        and casting medals.<a href="#fn31"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref31"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a> In a letter dated to 1629,
        Huygens’s friend Johan Brosterhuijsen mentions this treatise as a gift
        to Huygens, describing it as “the art of casting; it is a handwritten
        book, drawn from the memories of a great founder…” [<em>… l’art de
            getter; c’est un livret escrit à la main, tiré des memoires d’un
            grand fondeur…</em>].<a href="#fn32"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref32"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a> In the same letter
        Brosterhuijsen recommends Huygens learn the art of “casting herbs, etc.
        and gilding without gold” [<em>mouler sur des herbes, etc. et de dorer
            sans or</em>] from the “bag of secrets” [<em>son sac de
            secrets</em>] of the goldsmith Adriaen Rottermont—who does indeed
        appear to have been Huygens’s instructor.<a href="#fn33"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref33"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
    <p>Huygens, then, poses an interesting example of a learned man who not only
        practiced the art of casting medals himself but also collected recipes
        of such processes, among many others. A closer look at his “recipe
        books” is necessary, but it seems safe to assume that Huygens did not
        write them himself, nor did he comment upon them. Within the spectrum
        mentioned above, however, the author-practitioner of Ms. Fr. 640 appears
        to have been closer to the practitioner’s end than Huygens, while
        perhaps closer to the scholar’s end than Cellini.</p>
    <p>Although this essay cannot provide a definitive answer as to whether Ms.
        Fr. 640 was written by an author-practitioner who considered himself an
        artisan, our findings place him somewhere in between. The designation as
        “author-practitioner” seems appropriate, since he did have the skills,
        time, and interest to write this wide-ranging and intriguing manuscript,
        while also experimenting, or practicing, with his own recipes, as is
        evident from his notes and illustrations in the margins.<a href="#fn34"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref34"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a> Further research into founders’
        and artists’ practices might indicate whether the tools and workshops
        that reproduced cast objects were the same ones producing patterns and,
        thus, what the significance of Ms. Fr. 640’s omission of this
        information might mean. A deeper understanding of the various
        communities interested in, experimenting with, and writing about such
        practical knowledge is needed in order to determine the intersections of
        practical or experiential knowledge with theoretical or learned
        knowledge. Research on how common the acquisition of practical skills in
        the arts was in elite education, as seen in Huygens, could also shed
        more light on the background and milieu of the author-practitioner of
        Ms. Fr. 640.</p>

                <p>Glenn Wharton begins his article on a technique for
                    determining the facture of Renaissance medals (whether they
                    were cast or struck) with the remark, “The Art of Medals is
                    an art of multiples. From their origin in 1438 by Pisanello,
                    Renaissance medals were usually produced in series, either
                    cast in molds or struck from dies.” Arthur Beale writes,
                    “there is ample documentation by Renaissance authors that
                    using models, themselves made of metal, was an accepted
                    procedure during that period.” The significant terms used
                    for reproductions are the French <em>surmoulage</em>, or
                    “after-cast” in English. (These are not terms used by the

                    trencher was of course a disc of slate, or something
                    similar, such as we know was used by wax modellers for a
                    modelling board,” but he indicates only that Cellini used
                    this slate to carve into and does not acknowledge that in
                    this case the stone could have been used as a working
                    surface for wax as well. In his <em>Treatises</em>, Cellini
                    uses similar vocabulary: “The seals are made in the
                    following manner. You take a smooth and polished black
                    stone, and draw thereon the design you want to appear on the
                    seal; and with black wax, a bit hardened, you fashion
                    whatever relief you wish to impress.” Cellini, <em>The

                <p>For seals, this “volterrano gesso” is cast onto a black wax
                    model, as described in n.12. The gesso “matrix” is then
                    cleaned with a knife and impressed into sand molds. Because
                    the seal is a negative for pressing into wax, the cast metal
                    is a reverse (mirror) image, and therefore can be directly
                    cast in sand from the gesso. Positive versions of these

                    lost wax process, but those objects are distinct from what

                    bread molding experiments we undertook, this phrase
                    “prepared as you know” was an issue, since we did

                <p>In comparison to Cellini, who explicitly took as his task the
                    mission of writing a didactic treatise (as well as, of
                    course, proclaiming his skill), the author-practitioner of
                    Ms. Fr. 640 assumed that his audience already understood
                    some aspects of the recipes in his manuscript. Although Ms.
                    Fr. 640 at times refers to specific places and situations,
                    Cellini’s anecdotes read as concrete proof of the validity
                    of his directions and his successes, particularly in
                    references to his current or potential patrons. For a
                    slightly different period and geographic region, Francisco
                    Alonso-Almeida writes, “the expression of efficacy and
                    evaluation is gained by providing evidence of sources, such
                    as mentioning authorities….” Alonso-Almeida, “Genre
                    Conventions in English Recipes, 1600–1800,” in <em>Reading
                        and Writing Recipe Books, 1550–1800</em>, ed. Michelle
                    DiMeo and Sara Pennell (Manchester: Manchester University
                    Press, 2013), 74. Ms. Fr. 640 does not proclaim the same
                    impressive effects nor make the same claims to singularity
                    that are found in the writings of Cellini.<a href="#fnref27"

                <p>According to his autobiography, Huygens occupied himself with
                    medal making around 1628–29, when he started with producing
                    aftercasts of bronze and lead medals before moving on to
                    making his own originals: “When I, finally, had enough of
                    working with someone else’s work, I moved on to make my own
                    originals” [<em>Toen ik tenslotte genoeg gekregen had van
                        dat ezig zijn met het werk van een ander, was ik ertoe
                        overgegaan zelf originelen te maken</em>]; cited from A.

                    relevant, since we experienced for ourselves in our
                    laboratory work how much our understanding and appreciation
                    of medals has been increased by hands-on experience in

                <p>This treatise was bound together by Huygens with other
                    treatises (one of which is a note regarding the preparation
                    of wax, treatment of silver and gold, and the making of
                    medals by the goldsmith Adriaen Rottermont). This collection
                    was titled “Musica, medica, phijsica, chijmica, odofera,
                    perfumatoria, fusoria, coquinaria, philosophiaca,
                    mathematica, artificialia. Constantini Hugenii, Ars
                    formandorum et poliendorum votorum ad usum astronomicum,”
                    and is now held by the Royal Dutch Library (KB), The Hague,
                    inv. nr. KA XLVII. The manuscript concerning metalworking
                    begins at fol. 220ff. See De Heer, “Constantijn Huygens en
                    de Penningkunst,” 280, which also contains a transcription
                    on pp. 282–88. The entire bound book would be interesting to
                    compare to Ms. Fr. 640, as in both, the subjects range
                    widely. A study of Rottermont’s notes, found on fol. 185ff,
                    might determine whether he wrote them himself and what his
                    focus, as a goldsmith, was in these recipes. The manuscript
                    sent by Brosterhuijsen was apparently “drawn from the
                    memories of a founder,” also an interesting point of
                    comparison with Ms. Fr. 640.<a href="#fnref31"

                <p>Brosterhuijsen mentions that this treatise will be

                    It is not entirely clear who the author of this treatise is,
                    or, in other words, what the role of this Mr. (Willem) Dedel
                    was. Perhaps he transcribed treatises in Brosterhuijsen’s
                    possession. De Heer mentions two more such treatises in
                    Huygens’s binding, sent by Mr. Dedel, one of them concerning
                    life casting (fol. 227ff), the other for making plaster for
                    casting (fol. 228ff). See De Heer, “Constantijn Huygens en
