        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <div>
            <p>In an entry on fol. <a

                titled “Face in distemper,” the author-practitioner describes a
                method for depicting a face in paint on canvas. This essay
                analyzes that entry, contextualizing it in relation to other
                painting recipes in the manuscript and to other early modern
                artisanal treatises, before turning to laboratory
                reconstruction. Ms. Fr. 640 points to the intertwined
                relationship between representing skin and the body’s shadows,
                thereby reflecting broader concerns of early modern artistic
                practice. The author-practitioner also advises altering the hue
                of flesh shading by gender, which may owe something to humoral
                theory. Among the pigments he suggests using for male shadows is
                jet, a substance rarely mentioned in other painting treatises.
                The results of the reconstructions suggest that the specific
                paint medium intended by the term “distemper” may have been
                glue, but this is not conclusive and further experimentation is
                necessary.</p>

    <p>This essay explores the relationship between shadows and flesh in Ms. Fr.
        640 through a textual and practical investigation of the entry “Face in
        Distemper” (“<em>Visaige a destrempe</em>”) on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/93v/f/93v/tl"><u>93v</u></a>,
        a set of instructions for depicting a face in paint.<a href="#fn1"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref1"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> The process begins with painting
        shadows onto a canvas support with a small brush, followed by applying
        flesh tones in a translucent veil, before returning with another brush
        to lay in a final set of shading in cross-hatching. In this brief entry
        the author-practitioner uses a word for shadows (<em>ombres</em>) six
        times, while his term for skin tones (<em>carnation</em>) appears only
        twice. Reading this account alongside other related entries in the
        manuscript raises the following questions: why are shadows such a
        fundamental part of painting skin for the author-practitioner? What was
        painting <em>a destrempe</em> in material terms, and how does painting
        skin manifest particularly in that medium? Does his advice for painting
        a face in this way actually work in practice? And why did the
        author-practitioner suggest coloring the shadows of skin according to
        gender?</p>
    <p>To examine these issues, this essay begins by considering the
        author-practitioner’s references to shadows and the shading of skin in
        relation to wider artistic practice. It then turns to discuss the
        author-practitioner’s gendering of shadows, and a possible connection to
        humoral theory. It concludes with an investigation of the process of
        painting <em>a destrempe</em> through recipe reconstruction, which has
        offered a deeper insight into this technique than was possible with
        reading alone.</p>
    <h2 id="shadows-and-skin">Shadows and Skin</h2>
    <p>Shadows (<em>ombres</em>) are a recurring preoccupation in Ms. Fr. 640.
        The author-practitioner uses different spellings of the term apparently
        interchangeably, so <em>ombre</em>, <em>umbre</em>, and variations on
        these are found throughout. These terms occur on sixteen folios,
        demonstrating a range of interrelated meanings from the painterly to the
        environmental, with entries on eleven of those folios relating to
        painting techniques in particular. One can variously translate
        <em>ombre</em> and <em>umbre</em> into English as shadow, shade,
        shadowing, and shading. In Cotgrave’s French-English dictionary of 1611,
        <em>ombre</em> is translated as “a shadow; also, a shade, or covert;
        also, a color, cloake, vale, pretext, or pretence for; also as Umbre.”<a
           href="#fn2"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref2"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> The term is rich and multivalent,
        with connections to a particular pigment (umbre). An English translation
        as “shadows” preserves some of the ambiguity and range of the term, in
        preference to making a sharp distinction between “shading” as an
        artistic method and the depiction of a “shadow.” The author-practitioner
        invariably uses <em>ombre</em> or <em>umbre</em> as a noun in the entry
        on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/93v/f/93v/tl"><u>93v</u></a>.
    </p>
    <p>The author-practitioner does not appear to have been primarily a painter,
        and the manuscript is characterized by its variety of content relating
        to a wide range of artisanal practices. It includes recipe entries and
        working notes for diverse processes ranging from casting procedures to
        means for creating imitation gemstones to taxidermy methods. However,
        the author-practitioner does include a significant number of entries
        about painting methods in the manuscript, and it was clearly an area of
        interest to him. According to an analysis undertaken by the Making and
        Knowing team, about 14% of the manuscript entries relate to painting,
        paintings, or painters.<a href="#fn3"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref3"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> This is the second largest
        category of entries, superseded only by the number of entries on casting
        (ca. 34%). Entries pertaining to painting techniques cluster between
        fols. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/56r/f/56r/tl"><u>56r</u></a>
        and <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/67r/f/67r/tl"><u>67r</u></a>,
        and it is among these entries that the terms <em>ombre</em> or
        <em>umbre</em> occur most frequently. In Ms. Fr. 640, shading and
        shadows appear as concerns proper to the painter.</p>
    <p>It would be surprising if any treatment of painting technique in late
        sixteenth-century France failed to put an emphasis on shadows. Shadows
        emerged as vital to various aims of art and art theory during the
        Renaissance, such as depicting volumetrically convincing objects,
        creating a sense of space and depth, confirming presence, conveying
        naturalism in its many variants, and constituting an essential element
        of the painter’s identity and brief. At the very opening of the
        Quattrocento, Cennino Cennini (ca. 1360–before 1427) advised readers of
        his <em>Libro dell’Arte</em> to depict draperies and persons through
        attentive modeling from pure hue to bright light.<a href="#fn4"

           id="fnref4"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> Gian Battista Alberti (1404–1472)
        emphasized the critical role of light and shade for painters, altering
        the Cennino system to encourage the addition of black for the deepest
        shadows, with the goal of achieving the greatest impression of relief.<a

        influential, shaping the development of the theory that they were not
        totally dark but contained some colored reflections.<a href="#fn6"

           role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> By the end of the sixteenth
        century, Caravaggio (1571–1610) and the tenebrists had demonstrated how
        powerfully shadows could contribute to moving the emotions of the
        viewer, with works that drew much of their force from a dramatic
        opposition between deep shadows and bright lights. Victor Stoichita’s
        <em>A Short History of the Shadow</em> gives the fullest account of the
        Renaissance history of the shadow, a history which lies beyond the scope
        of this essay but within which the author-practitioner’s interest in the
        use of shadows and shading in painting belongs.<a href="#fn8"

    <h3 id="shading-flesh">Shading Flesh </h3>
    <p>The author-practitioner often mentions <em>ombres</em> in recipes for
        painting skin tones. In the entry “Shadows” (“<em>Ombres</em>”) on fol.
        <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/58v/f/58v/tl"><u>58v</u></a>,
        he writes, “when you are making a painting with several persons, just as
        the flesh colors have to be different, so do the shadows
        [<em>ombres</em>].” In “Work of the Flemish” (“<em>Labeur des
            flamens</em>”) on fols. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/60v/f/60v/tl"><u>60v</u></a>–<a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/61r/f/61r/tl"><u>61r</u></a>,
        he notes that once the imprimatura is well evened and dry, the Flemish,
        “draw their portrait &amp; layer their natural flesh color, leaving the
        space for shadow [<em>ombres</em>]” (fol. 61r). And in “Shadows”
        (“<em>Umbres</em>”) on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/63r/f/63r/tl"><u>63r</u></a>,
        he observes, “German painters make their shadows [<em>ombres</em>] on
        flesh color of men with ground jet, stil de grain yellow &amp; ocher.”
    </p>
    <p>Other historical painting treatises relate flesh and shadows in ways that
        can illuminate the connection between flesh and shadows in Ms. Fr. 640.
        From the Medieval period to the seventeenth century, when writers
        discussed methods for depicting faces and bodies they habitually
        included instructions for how to shade them. One of the earliest known
        treatises in the European tradition, <em>De diversis artibus</em>
        (<em>On Divers Arts</em>) by Theophilus (fl. ca. 1070–1125)<em>,</em>
        opens with a chapter dedicated to “The mixture of pigments for nude
        bodies,” and in section three offers “the first shadow pigment,” for
        “the eyebrows and eyes, the nostrils and mouth, the chin, the hollows
        round the nostrils…and all the distinctive limbs of the nude body.”<a

        (1538–1592), a near-contemporary text to Ms. Fr. 640, makes the ability

    <p>Observations about the techniques of figure painting and the shading of
        skin also appear together in the De Mayerne manuscript, compiled by
        Swiss physician Sir Théodore Turquet de Mayerne (1573–1655) from his
        conversations with practicing artists. De Mayerne notes, “Faces and
        Flesh Parts White lead, yellow, ocher, brown red. For shading: white
        lead, yellow ocher, ivory black,” and, in a discussion of lamp black, he
        adds, “shadows for flesh parts are excellently made with earth black.”<a

        and shadows possible, connecting the two closely, and finishes with the
        following summary:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>But to prescribe an absolute and general Rule is both impossible, and

    <p>In the entry for “Face in distemper” on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/93v/f/93v/tl"><u>93v</u></a>,
        the author-practitioner describes a method for painting a face that
        begins with an underlayer of painted shadows, builds up flesh tones on
        top, and finishes with a delicately hatched shadow layer on the very
        surface. <em>Les ombres</em> thus provide both the foundation and the
        final step of a layered painting process for depicting a face. A long
        tradition supports the author-practitioner’s instructions, as medieval
        and early modern painters often put down a darker first layer beneath
        flesh tones when depicting skin. The use of a <em>verdaccio</em> layer,
        a greenish-brown layer made of earth pigments, as a base for skin tones
        beneath egg tempera and fresco paintings, is described by Cennino
        Cennini in his <em>Libro dell’Arte</em>, and artists widely used it for
        thirteenth- and fourteenth-century Italian paintings. Yet a dark base
        was also used by painters elsewhere in Europe, as Ann-Sophie Lehmann and
        Marjolijn Bol have explained:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>To depict skin accurately… intricate, yet surprisingly similar paint
            systems evolved in Italian, French, German, and Netherlandish
            painting. These entailed a complex layer build up on a dark, often
            greenish under layer for a turbid medium effect, and very fine
            strokes or dots on the surface to suggest fluent transitions.<a

    </blockquote>
    <p>Paintings in protein and water-based media often have dark undermodelling
        layers, although they are by no means exclusive to them. <em>Joseph
            Interpreting the Dreams of Pharaoh</em>, an unfinished painting
        attributed to German artist Jörg Breu the Younger (ca. 1510–1547), gives
        insight into the application of a grey undermodelling layer for a
        painting in distemper on linen. This layer is visible on the dogs in the
        foreground and on the figures clustered around the Pharaoh on his throne
        (<i><u>Fig. 1</u></i>). While not especially dark today (it may have
        been subject to fading), the undermodelling nevertheless effectively
        indicates where the artist intended to place the shadowed areas in a
        completed version of the work.</p>

    <p>We can therefore see that the interwoven relationship between the
        painting of skin and shadows conveyed by the author-practitioner fits
        well into a broad panorama of painting practice in Europe from the late
        Middle Ages through the seventeenth century. The specific technique that
        he indicates—putting down a base layer of shadows before applying the
        flesh tones—has its roots in traditional processes for painting in
        water-based media dating back to at least the thirteenth century.</p>
    <h3 id="gendered-shadows">Gendered Shadows</h3>
    <p>The author-practitioner’s system for painting flesh by beginning and
        ending with shadows bears further scrutiny. In a set of related recipes
        on fols. 65r and 66r, the author-practitioner instructs the painter to
        use a distinct set of pigments for the shadows of women and for men. His
        gendering of shadows suggests that they play a fundamental and more
        complex role than might be apparent at first pass.</p>
    <p>The author-practitioner spells out this distinction in the recipe on fol.
        <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/65r/f/65r/tl"><u>65r</u></a>
        entitled “Shadows.” Here, he states that men’s shadows are yellowish
        (<em>jaulnastre</em>), while “blacks which make a greenish black are
        appropriate for women’s shadows.” On fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/66r/f/66r/tl"><u>66r</u></a>,
        in another entry entitled “Shadows,” he again genders the pigment
        choice, writing, “for women, asphaltum, umber, &amp; a little lake.”
        Although the author-practitioner does not specify that the face in the
        recipe on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/93v/f/93v/tl"><u>93v</u></a>
        is female, the pigments he suggests for the shadows (sap green, bistre,
        and <em>ocre de ru</em>) are similar to those he indicates on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/65r/f/65r/tl"><u>65r</u></a>
        as suitable for producing “a perfect shadow [<em>umbre</em>] for women
        in distemper”: sap green (<em>verd de vessie</em>), bistre
        (<em>bistre</em>), and a black (<em>noir</em>). Following the word
        <em>noir</em>, the author-practitioner left a space as if he intended to
        specify which black to use, but this gap was never filled in. In the
        recipe on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/93v/f/93v/tl"><u>93v</u></a>,
        black is omitted, and <em>ocre de ru</em> is included instead. A
        combination of sap green, bistre, and black would result in a greenish
        cast to a dark color.<a href="#fn14"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref14"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> It therefore seems likely that
        the face that the author-practitioner intended on fol. 93v was a female
        countenance. But why did he consider “greenish black” particularly
        appropriate for women’s shadows as opposed to men’s shadows? More
        broadly, why does the author-practitioner distinguish in this way
        between the colors of the shadows of male and female faces?</p>
    <p>The author-practitioner’s prescriptions for gendered shadows belong
        within a tradition of painterly practice evinced in text and image. It
        is common to find different hues in male and female skin in early modern
        paintings, where women are often portrayed as being lighter skinned than
        men. Depictions of Adam and Eve make this difference very clear, as seen
        in depictions as diverse as Cornelis Cornelisz. van Haarlem’s 1592
        <em>Fall of Man</em> (<i><u>Fig. 2</u></i>) and an early
        sixteenth-century French manuscript illumination of the same subject (<i><u>Fig. 3</u></i>). Moreover, in the catalogue for the exhibition
        <em>Hot Dry Men, Cold Wet Women: The Theory of Humors in Western
            European Art,</em> Zirka Filipczak has argued that Rubens used skin
        coloration to indicate that the figure who appeared to be Diana was
        really Jupiter in disguise in his 1613 <em>Callisto and Jupiter</em> (<i><u>Fig. 4</u></i>).</p>

    <p>This gendering of flesh tone was not a strict convention; rather, in the

        bodies as whiter than those of men.”<a href="#fn15"

    <p>Early modern painting treatises frequently suggested using different
        colors for male and female skin. A note from the De Mayerne manuscript,
        under the heading “Methods for doing the nude and faces,” exemplifies
        this concern: “carnation is usually made with white lead, or ceruse with
        vermillion or lead minimum, or lake, or yellow ocher, as one will have
        it or as the work requires for the masculine, as well as the feminine,
        flesh tones.”<a href="#fn17"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref17"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> According to Ann-Sophie Lehmann,
        one of the earliest recipes to distinguish male and female flesh colors
        occurs in a Dutch manuscript compiled before 1500. Here, lead white,
        vermilion, and rose make a good color for a woman’s body, while Parisian
        red and lead white are suitable for female faces; for the body color of
        men, yellow ocher should be included, a combination of pigments that
        would lead to a more yellow hued flesh tone.<a href="#fn18"

    <p>It seems that early modern painting treatises usually instructed the
        gendering of skin color through the carnation layer, and that therefore
        the author-practitioner is somewhat unusual in choosing to vary the skin
        tones of men and women primarily through tinting their shadows
        differently. However, he was not unique in gendering the painting of
        shadows. In book two of his <em>De’ Veri Precetti della Pittura</em>
        (1586), Giovanni Battista Armenini (1530–1609) explains that “there are
        those who add some pure <em>terra verde</em> to these darks; others add
        the <em>terra verde</em> burned and baked in the way described for
        yellow. There are others yet who add <em>terra di campana,</em>
        especially when they wish to imitate the delicate shadows appearing in
        the flesh of young women.”<a href="#fn19"

    <h3 id="the-humors">The Humors</h3>
    <p>Humoral theory can help account for the artistic interest in the
        subtleties of skin. In the early modern humoral worldview, women were
        considered colder and wetter than men, as seventeenth-century French
        physician Marin Cureau de la Chambre expressed: “the Temperament of Man
        is hot and dry, and that of the woman cold and moist.”<a href="#fn20"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref20"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> Conventional
        medical theory held that bodies were composed of four humors (blood,
        phlegm, black bile, and yellow bile), which combined to form a
        particular “temperament” or “complexion” that differed according to sex,
        age, and other factors. Specific elements constituted each humor (water,
        fire, earth, and air), and contemporaries associated each with certain
        qualities. According to Cureau de la Chambre, “reading the signs
        inscribed on the bodily exterior” could reveal the inner, fundamental
        aspects of a person. The color of a person’s complexion could indicate
        what “complexion” of humors he or she possessed. For instance, a man
        with a ruddy face had a predominance of the sanguine humor (blood) in
        his temperament. Humoral constitutions thus provide a lens through which
        to view differences between male and female skin colors. A cold and wet
        temperament would tend towards the phlegmatic, and towards a pale, cool
        tone of the skin.<a href="#fn21"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref21"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
    <p>Lomazzo’s 1584 <em>Trattato</em> demonstrates that some early modern
        artists varied the colors used to depict skin according to the humoral
        composition of the person being represented. Lomazzo’s treatise explains
        for its readers the theory of the humors and exhorts the painter to pay
        close attention to the way that the temperaments of men express
        themselves outwardly, in actions, gestures, features, and the color of
        the skin, advising painters to “make the skin of sanguine figures
        rosier, melancholics swarthier, cholerics yellower, and phlegmatics
        paler.”<a href="#fn22"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref22"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a> In book six, chapter nine,
        Lomazzo describes the colors that correspond to the expression of the
        four humors in the flesh of human bodies, and in chapter ten, entitled
        “Come l’ombre debbono seguire il colore delle carni” (“How the shadows
        must follow the colors of the flesh”), he explains how the shadows must
        follow the colors of that humorally tinted skin, specifying relevant
        pigment combinations.<a href="#fn23"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref23"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>It seems that for the author-practitioner, as for Lomazzo, shadows and
        flesh were so closely interwoven that variation in one necessarily
        implied variation in the other. The entry “Shadows” (“<em>Ombres</em>”)
        on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/58v/f/58v/tl"><u>58v</u></a>
        notes, “when you are making a painting with several persons, just as the
        flesh colors have to be different, so do the shadows.” Yet unlike
        Lomazzo, the author-practitioner’s material specifications for depicting
        gender begin and end with shadows. The “Face in distemper” entry on fol.
        <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/93v/f/93v/tl"><u>93v</u></a>
        describes how to apply shadows as the first layer of the depiction,
        embedding the distinction between representations of males and females
        at the foundation of the work. There are no references in Ms. Fr. 640 to
        changing the carnation colors for subsequent paint layers to distinguish
        males from females—this difference is specified only for the painting of
        shadows.</p>
    <p>Artists varied the “complexions” of men and women for many reasons that
        did not necessarily owe anything directly to humoral theory. For
        instance, elite women often kept indoors, and female standards of beauty
        promoted pale skin. Yet, in the early modern worldview, the colors of
        the flesh were fundamentally related to both the inner constitution of
        the person covered by that skin and increasingly to its external
        appearance. The very word “complexion,” used today to refer to the skin
        of the face, referred previously to the combination of humors in the
        body.<a href="#fn24"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref24"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a> According to Kimberly Poitevin,
        by “1601, the word had also come to mean ‘a coloring preparation
        applied… to “give a complexion” to the face.’”<a href="#fn25"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref25"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a> The surface of the skin revealed
        the inner—humoral—self on the outside, through the “complexion,” but by
        the end of the sixteenth century this exterior might be altered through
        the application of paint to skin.</p>
    <h3 id="painting-skin-with-skin">Painting Skin with Skin</h3>
    <p>Human skin is translucent, laminar, and the appearance of its surface
        owes a great deal to the layers beneath. The parallel between the
        author-practitioner’s system for painting a face using layers of
        distemper and the layered composition of human flesh is provocative.
        Studying real skin through its surface, one can see cool greenish or
        bluish tones below, in the veins, particularly if the skin is pale, as
        was fashionable for women in sixteenth-century France. Women in early
        modern England sometimes painted blue veins on their skin, which points
        to the contemporary sensitivity to the play of veining beneath female
        flesh, and by extension to the impact of the inside of the body on the
        outside. Does the author-practitioner gender the base-tone from the very
        start to mimic the way that human skin, translucent and layered, reveals
        the inner self, constituted of the humors, lying beneath?</p>
    <p>The use of distemper draws a particularly close connection between the
        depiction of flesh and flesh itself. “Distemper colors” (<em>couleurs a
            destrempe</em>) could be made of glue, which was normally made
        either from animal hide or parchment clippings (which also ultimately
        originated from animal skins). Although this recipe does not specify
        what the author-practitioner intends by “distemper colors” (<em>couleurs
            a destrempe</em>), on balance it seems to indicate the use of
        pigments bound in animal glue.<a href="#fn26"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref26"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a> In the process of painting a
        face in distemper, then, the early modern practitioner might be creating
        skin using skin. It is difficult to know how much thought was given to
        this connection, but certainly early modern artisans would have been far
        more aware of the origins of the materials they used than most people
        are today. How differently might the act of “mimicking” skin be
        considered if the process were carried out using skin itself? The very
        language used to describe the painting of skin in this way seems to draw
        some connection with humoral theory. <em>Destrempe</em> is connected
        etymologically to the Latin <em>temperare</em>, that is to proportion or
        mingle properly, which is also the root of the term “temperament,” i.e.,
        the blend and balance of an individual’s humoral makeup that was also
        manifest in the “complexion.” The material synchronicity between the
        substances being used to paint and the material being depicted is
        intriguing here.</p>
    <p>In the entry for “Face in distemper” there are moments when the language
        that describes the process for painting a face seems to converge with
        the language that would be used to describe a living person,
        particularly when the author writes, “and again with a more lively flesh
        color [<em>carnation plus vive</em>], one touches the more prominent
        areas” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/93v/f/93v/tl"><u>93v</u></a>).
        The French seems to press for a more symbolically rich reading because
        of the evocation of “incarnation” present in the term
        <em>carnation</em>, particularly when connected with the notion of
        something being <em>plus vive</em>, that is, “more lively” or “more
        alive.” A dense web of meaning thus appears to connect the
        author-practitioner’s instructions for shadowed flesh in this recipe
        with the internal humoral composition of the body that was such a
        fundamental part of early modern understandings of the body’s inner
        workings.</p>
    <h2 id="reconstructions">Reconstructions</h2>
    <p>I carried out reconstructions with three principle aims: to understand
        what medium was intended by the term <em>destrempe</em>, to understand
        the difference between colors indicated for the shadows of male and
        female skin, and to establish whether the author-practitioner’s layered
        painting system is effective for imitating skin.<a href="#fn27"

        supplemented by related recipes across the manuscript. In addition, I
        experimented with the use of jet as a pigment for men’s shadows. The
        translated instructions of the entry on fol. 93v read:</p>

            on canvas with a wet sponge. Then, with a small paintbrush, one
            makes the shadows, which do not come undone. Next, one lays the
            flesh color, which does not prevent the already painted shadows from
            appearing [i.e., showing through the paint]. And again with a more
            lively flesh color, one touches the more prominent areas. And with
            another paintbrush, one does the shadows again by hatching. The

    <h3 id="sizing">Sizing</h3>
    <p>In the recipe, the author-practitioner makes no mention of preparing the
        canvas using a size or ground layer, which initially seemed strange.
        Available literature on the materials and techniques of early modern
        distemper paintings suggest that they usually had a size preparation
        layer. Some works executed with glue on canvas by Dieric Bouts have a
        thin glue size preparation, while Mantegna’s <em>Sampson and
            Delilah</em> has a more substantial one.<a href="#fn28"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref28"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a> On the other hand, technical
        study at the National Gallery London carried out on glue distemper
        paintings by Quentin Massys and Dieric Bouts were not able to prove
        whether they ever had a size layer.<a href="#fn29"

    <p>In the study of early modern artisanal craft treatises, the issue of
        tacit knowledge is pervasive. Writer-practitioners would often have been
        able to rely on their readers to fill apparent gaps in their texts with
        such knowledge.<a href="#fn30"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref30"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a> To investigate whether tacit
        knowledge of the habitual practice of sizing canvases for painting was
        supposed to undergird this recipe, I prepared two canvases differently.
    </p>
    <p>I stretched two linen canvases onto wooden auxiliary supports, and left
        the first one raw, that is, unsized. I prepared the second canvas by
        sizing it with two layers of 10% rabbit skin glue with a small addition
        of champagne chalk.<a href="#fn31"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref31"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>I then proceeded to experiment by first wetting the back of the canvas,
        as instructed, and used a small brush to paint in the shadows of a face
        according to the recipe from fol. 93v. Once I began the process of
        painting, some of my questions about canvas preparation were swiftly
        answered. The sized canvas did not allow the moisture to penetrate from
        the back to the front of the canvas and therefore rendered the
        instruction to do so pointless (<i><u>Fig. 6</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 7</u></i>).<a href="#fn32"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref32"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a> Therefore, it seems probable
        that the author-practitioner intended an unsized canvas as the support
        for painting in this case and that its absence from the entry was not an
        oversight or a call to use tacit knowledge. This proved a lesson in
        careful reading of the text and following its advice before rushing to
        draw conclusions from prior, secondary reading.</p>

    <h3 id="paint-medium">Paint Medium</h3>
    <p>Identification of the medium for “Face in distemper” is complicated by
        the fact that the term <em>destrempe</em>, or words closely related to
        it, is used around ninety times across the manuscript in a variety of
        senses, including in recipes for casting as well as a binder for
        pigments. This ambiguity is related to the larger issue of polysemy
        surrounding the English word “distemper” (and its cognates in other
        languages). As a type of paint, it is always defined as water-based, but
        there is no agreement in current scholarship as to its specific meaning.
        Andrea Rothe seems to equate it with an animal-glue binder, remarking
        that although Mantegna’s painting technique for his <em>Adoration of the
            Magi</em> “was generally described as painted in tempera or oil,
        recent analysis carried out by the Getty Conservation Institute has
        identified the medium as distemper (animal glue).”<a href="#fn33"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref33"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a> More recently, Sophie Scully and
        Christine Seidel, in an article on a <em>tüchlein</em> by Justus van
        Ghent at The Metropolitan Museum of Art, describe distemper as a
        “catch-all term used to refer to pigments bound in a water-based medium,
        sometimes gum or egg-white, but most often animal glue.”<a href="#fn34"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref34"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a> More broadly still, the Oxford
        English dictionary defines distemper painting as,&nbsp;</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>A method of painting, in which the colors are mixed with some
            glutinous substance soluble in water, as yolk of egg mixed with
            water, etc., usually executed upon a ground of chalk or plaster
            mixed with gum (distemper-ground): mostly used in scene painting,
            and in the internal decoration of walls.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>The confusion around this term and related
        terms is not only an issue of dictionary definitions, it is also
        connected to the methods and limitations we have for discerning the
        paint media used in historical paintings. As Rothe explains, there is
        some “difficulty in analytically distinguishing egg from glue, as both
        are complex proteins. The analytical results can also be unreliable
        because infusions of glues from later relinings and consolidants make it
        difficult to determine whether they are part of the original medium.”<a
           href="#fn35"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref35"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
    <p>Practitioners were concerned primarily with the results that they could
        achieve and the handling properties of their materials—not their
        identification at a chemical level. Sometimes they may have used egg
        white, glue, or gum arabic interchangeably, as suggested by a recipe in
        the De Mayerne manuscript which is very similar to that on fol. 93v.<a

    <p>I experimented with painting the shadow layer of the face using the three
        most likely paint media: glue, egg white, and gum arabic. For the trial
        using glue as the medium, I used rabbit skin glue at a concentration of
        approximately 10%. Working on a damp canvas proved to be very important
        for this medium, as the humidity of the support improved the paint flow
        and slowed the drying time, avoiding the rapid coagulation that occurred
        when animal glue paint was used on the sized canvas. This was extremely
        important, because the fast drying time of glue seems to be one of its
        main limitations in comparison with other paint media. Using animal glue
        as the medium and following the instructions of the text to use an
        unsized canvas dampened from the reverse was quite successful (<i><u>Fig. 8</u></i>).</p>

                the medium, the top right using gum arabic, and the bottom right
                using egg white. In all cases the canvas was dampened with a
                sponge from the reverse during painting, as can be seen in this
                photograph in the top left. The moisture made the animal glue
                much easier to use. In contrast, the moisture seemed to flood
                the gum arabic trial and cause the paint to bleed excessively.
                It had a similar effect on the egg white, but to a lesser
                degree. © Making and Knowing Project (<a

    <p>Using egg white as the medium on unsized and dampened canvas also
        produced a successful result, and the medium was similar in handling
        properties and final result to the animal glue. By contrast in the trial
        with a distemper made from gum arabic on unsized canvas, the penetration
        of the canvas by moisture flooded the paint, causing it to flow
        excessively beyond the bounds of the underdrawing. It seems challenging
        to use gum arabic with a very damp canvas, though there are many
        variables that could have contributed to my lack of success with this
        medium in this particular trial.</p>
    <h3 id="pigments-for-a-womans-shadows">Pigments for a Woman’s Shadows</h3>
    <p>When painting the shadow layer, I used the pigments suggested by the
        author-practitioner: bistre, <em>ocre de ru</em>, and a little sap
        green. Bistre (or bister) is a black-brown pigment that conservation
        scientists Maria L. Roldan et al. note is normally made from wood soot
        collected near to a flame.<a href="#fn37"

        the author-practitioner specifies that “the best bistre is the greasy
        &amp; shiny kind from the fireplaces of large kitchens.” He also notes
        that such bistre “is difficult to grind &amp; screeches on the marble,”
        and indeed, when I ground bistre in water in my reconstruction,
        discussed below, it did make a particularly grating sound. According to
        Rosamond D. Harley, bistre is mainly used with water-based binders,
        which corroborates the author-practitioner’s instruction that it is
        “good for” distemper but not for working in oil.<a href="#fn38"

           id="fnref38"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>38</sup></a> Wood soot may have been used as

        cost, and tinting power, but the seventeenth century is normally cited
        as the period in which the term “bistre” began to be used. The use of
        the term in this manuscript, thought to date from the late sixteenth
        century, may be a significant early example.</p>
    <p>Sap green was a pigment made from ripe buckthorn berries, and the French
        term <em>vert de vessie</em> (lit., “bladder green”) has been thought to
        originate in the fact that it was often stored in a bladder.<a

        and established that they were in all probability considered appropriate
        for representing a woman, I was keen to understand the difference in hue
        between those and the shadows that the author-practitioner advised using
        for male figures. In the entry on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/65r/f/65r/tl"><u>65r</u></a>
        in which the author-practitioner specified the use of pigments to arrive
        at a “greenish black” for women’s figures, he instructed the painter to
        use “very strongly ground jet” mixed with ocher and white lead for the
        “yellowish” shadows of men. He repeated the direction to use jet
        (<em>geiete</em>) as a pigment for male shadows in an entry entitled
        “Shadows” (“<em>Umbres</em>”) on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/63r/f/63r/tl"><u>63r</u></a>:
        “German painters make their shadows [ombres] on flesh color of men with
        ground jet, <em>stil de grain</em> yellow &amp; ocher.” Jet is a variety
        of lignite (fossilized wood) that is characteristically black or dark
        brown. There is a long history of using jet in jewelry; it can be
        polished to a high shine, is relatively soft and thus easy to work, and
        is relatively lightweight. Whitby in the British Isles is a particularly
        well-known source of jet, and the jet bought for this experiment was
        acquired from there, but the material was also mined in
        France.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Jet seems to be absent from the secondary literature as a material for
        the production of black pigment.<a href="#fn41"

           role="doc-noteref"><sup>41</sup></a> I was therefore very interested
        in evaluating whether it could be used as a pigment.</p>
    <p>When I cut the jet, it was dark blue inside, and when it was first
        crushed, the particles had a blue, glass-like appearance, likely due to
        the state of dessication. Further pounding in the pestle and mortar
        produced a yellowish tint, and the color gradually changed towards a
        dark blue-green. When ground with water the color remained a dark
        blue-green. I experimented with grinding it in linseed oil to assess the
        effect of medium variation on color and the hue shifted to a green-gray
        when ground further with the oil (<i><u>Fig. 10</u></i>).</p>

    <h3 id="carnation-layers">Carnation Layers</h3>
    <p>I proceeded to follow the rest of the recipe using animal skin glue as a
        medium. This allowed me to investigate the handling properties of this
        rather unusual medium in more depth. The next layer to be applied after
        the shadow was the first “carnation” layer: “Next, one lays the flesh
        color [<em>carnation</em>], which does not prevent the already painted
        shadows from appearing” (fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/93v/f/93v/tl"><u>93v</u></a>).
        No specific instructions were provided in this entry for the combination
        of pigments to be used for the “carnation,” so I drew upon entries
        elsewhere in the manuscript to guide this aspect of my reconstruction. I
        used madder lake and yellow ocher in combination with champagne chalk to
        create a pink skin tone.<a href="#fn42"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref42"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>42</sup></a> Chalk was selected over lead
        white for this layer, because it functions as an opaque pigment when
        bound in glue, whereas in oil it becomes transparent. Chalk was used as
        a white pigment in paintings produced using glue on linen, for instance
        those by Dieric Bouts.<a href="#fn43"

        using chalk as an opaque medium in this method, and it did indeed
        function successfully to lighten the combination of yellow ocher and
        madder to achieve a bright flesh tone (<i><u>Fig. 11</u></i>). The
        application of this flesh colored layer over the shadowed layer beneath
        was successful; as suggested by the entry, the carnation veil remained
        translucent and allowed the shadows beneath to penetrate to the surface
        (<i><u>Fig. 12</u></i>).</p>

    <p>Next I followed the indications that “again with a more lively flesh
        color, one touches the more prominent areas” (fol. 93v). For this stage,
        I used lead white in combination with the madder lake and yellow ocher
        to achieve a brighter white and to see what contrasts could be achieved
        using both lead white and chalk white in a painting in glue on linen (<i><u>Fig. 13</u></i>). Although using lead white increased the opacity
        of this layer somewhat in comparison with the chalk white, it remained
        sufficiently translucent so as to allow the subtle penetration of both
        the shadow and first carnation layer through to the final surface. Areas
        that began with the dark shadow as the base and were then covered by two
        further layers of carnation, such as the center-right of the forehead,
        looked notably cool and pale in the final result (<i><u>Fig. 14</u></i>).</p>

    <h3 id="paint-handling">Paint Handling</h3>
    <p>Entries elsewhere in the manuscript proved useful as additional guides to
        the process of painting—how to handle the paint, what <em>ductus</em> to
        adopt. In an entry on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/65r/f/65r/tl"><u>65r</u></a>
        entitled “Flesh color” (“<em>Carnation</em>”), the author-practitioner
        emphasizes the importance of “softening”:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>You must know well the mixing of colors &amp; the appropriate
            shadows, but above all make sure to soften them well. And note &amp;
            observe that a thing which appears flat needs to be softened
            lengthwise, as if going from right to left like [illustration of
            diagonal hatching], and whatever ought to appear round must be
            softened in circles.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>By soften (<em>adoulcir</em>), the
        author-practitioner seems to mean blending, especially between the darks
        and the lights, which creates a more even surface and crucially allows
        one to achieve an impression of relief on a flat surface:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>if you want to model relief well, soften round things by rounding
            them with the point of the paintbrush &amp; the rest with the flat
            part if it is flat, &amp; thus for the others according to their
            nature, &amp; lightly with the point of the dry &amp; flattened
            paintbrush &amp; with patience.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The need to soften between lights and darks in the production of flesh
        tones raised the question of how achievable this would be with a
        glue-based medium that dries quickly. The author-practitioner addresses
        this problem in a marginal note to the entry “Painter” on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/56v/f/56v/tl"><u>56v</u></a>:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>In distemper do not mix your different colors together for this makes
            them die, but use each separately. And in order that they do not dry
            &amp; that you have time to soften, moisten the back of the canvas.
        </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>Following the procedure for “Face in
        distemper,” I found that it was possible to achieve some blending of
        colors thanks to the moisture provided by wetting the back of the canvas
        with a damp sponge (<i><u>Fig. 15</u></i>). This advantage was limited,
        however, as wetting the canvas too much from the reverse slightly
        re-dissolved the layer beneath and risked causing the medium to
        reticulate. Thus, while further wetting might have made increased
        softening possible, it might have done more harm than good to the
        overall effect.</p>

    <h3 id="final-shading">Final Shading </h3>
    <p>It was not possible for me to achieve a blending effect in the final
        shadow layer applied at the end of the painting process. This was
        because the number of glue paint layers had built up sufficiently on the
        surface to prevent the moisture applied from the back of the canvas from
        coming through to the surface. To further saturate the canvas with water
        would have caused too great a reticulation of the glue painted layers
        already applied (some reticulation was already observed before I stopped
        wetting the back). This may explain why the author-practitioner insists
        on cross-hatching as the technique to be used for the final shadows on
        the face:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>And with another paintbrush, one does the shadows again by hatching.
            The shadow strokes do not come undone because they are made of
            bistre, which stains the canvas like rust.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>Much as I was, the author-practitioner
        seems to have been concerned with the risk that the shadows might come
        “undone.” Hatching allows a visual gradation between two paint layers
        when either the medium is opaque or the layering of a fast drying paint
        renders wet-on-wet blending impossible. The application of the final
        hatching shadow layer was quite successful in the experiment,
        particularly where hatching was done over multiple layers of the skin
        tone (<i><u>Fig. 16</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 17</u></i>).</p>

    <h2 id="reconstruction-insights">Reconstruction Insights</h2>
    <p>The reconstruction process suggests that the most likely medium intended
        by distemper in this case is animal skin glue, although considerable
        further experimentation is needed to reach firm conclusions. I found
        both egg white and glue were successful media for this painting method
        in my experiments, but textual clues indicate that the
        author-practitioner did not mean egg white when he used the term
        “distemper.” In a recipe on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/66r/f/66r/tl"><u>66r</u></a>,
        the author-practitioner writes that because it is unpleasant to paint in
        distemper on wood, some temper or thin their colors with egg white and
        apply it with a sponge. Here, he is clearly distinguishing between
        distemper and egg white, which, though it can be used as a substitute
        binding medium, is not quite synonymous.</p>
    <p>The main caveat to this conclusion in favor of animal skin glue distemper
        is the fact that the author-practitioner does not advise keeping the
        glue warm while painting. In the reconstructions, it was necessary to
        keep the glue medium warm at all times in order to paint with it. Other
        painting treatises do mention this, for instance <em>De coloribus
            diversis modis tractatur in sequentibus,</em> compiled by Johannes
        Alcherius (fl. 1382–1411), is very insistent on the subject, saying:
        “lastly, let the size, or sized water be warm; I say warm; lest it may
        be conglutinated… when it is cold it will be congealed like jelly.”<a
           href="#fn44"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref44"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>44</sup></a> Attempts to use animal glue as a
        binding medium without heating were unsuccessful.&nbsp;Here again, one
        faces the question of tacit knowledge—did the author-practitioner assume
        that any painter would know to keep the glue warm? Or did some property
        of his glue, perhaps its concentration or derivation from a particular
        animal, for instance, allow him to use such a medium without heat? We do
        not know whether the author-practitioner ever tried out the instructions
        he gives here, so it is also possible that information is missing
        because he is reporting it secondhand.</p>
    <p>The combination of pigments indicated by the author-practitioner for the
        shadows on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/93v/f/93v/tl"><u>93v</u></a>
        creates a brownish grey with a hint of green. His indication to combine
        pigments to form a greenish tint suggests that, according to his system
        of gendering the color of shadows, the face that he had in mind here was
        a woman’s.</p>
    <p>My experiment with jet was not particularly successful or conclusive,
        although it did determine that jet can be crushed with relative ease
        into a powder that could potentially serve as a pigment. I found the
        pigment to be a dark blue in water and a greenish-grey in linseed oil.
        Many variables could have contributed to the unexpected color of the
        final pigment I produced. These results surprised me because I expected
        a pigment derived from jet would be black, not least because coal,
        similar in chemical composition to jet, has sometimes been used as a
        black pigment. It is also possible that the author-practitioner may have
        made a mistake in suggesting “jet” (<em>geiete</em>) here, as there are
        two strike-throughs in the recipe on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/65r/f/65r/tl"><u>65r</u></a>,
        and at one point he appears unable to decide on the appropriate term for
        a tool and replaces it with a small drawing of a pentagon. Towards the
        end of the same recipe, he writes “black of” (<em>noir de</em>) and then
        leaves a space, perhaps as though intending to return and fill in a
        qualifier later. This could indicate that the author-practitioner had
        obtained his information secondhand, or that perhaps he felt uncertain
        about the materials and process he was recording in this recipe.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>I was able to achieve a fairly successful depiction of a face using glue
        as the medium and drawing on advice about techniques for painting in
        distemper and skin elsewhere in the manuscript to support the
        instructions on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/93v/f/93v/tl"><u>93v</u></a>
        (<i><u>Fig. 18</u></i>). The translucency of the medium permits the
        shadows to show through to the surface of the image effectively, and a
        combination of softening and cross-hatching allows the painter to create
        a suggestion of relief. The superimposition of translucent colors
        affords an imitation of the layered, translucent quality of human flesh.
        The achievable results would undoubtedly improve with repeated practice.

                something of a modelled effect. With greater practice, it seems

    <p>The author-practitioner was very interested in the different techniques
        required for working in distemper as opposed to in an oil medium and he
        is sufficiently attentive that his directions for the methods required
        for handling distemper paint were effective in practice.</p>
    <p>In a series of marginal notes on fol. <a
           href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/56v/f/56v/tl"><u>56v</u></a>
        under the heading “Painter,” he discusses the need for training in the
        specific media and makes an observation about regional variation:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>The one who makes a profession of working in oil will hardly work
            well in distemper if he has not been trained well from adolescence.
            For the way of working is different, because when washing the
            paintbrush for distemper, one always leaves it moist. And on the
            contrary, when one cleans the paintbrush in oil to soften, one wipes
            the paintbrush well. Otherwise, the work would run &amp; would soon
            be all disfigured.</p>
        <p>***</p>
        <p>The Italians soften by hatching with a large flattened paintbrush
            which makes serrations.</p>
        <p>***</p>
        <p>And they do not lay their shadow all at once like the Flemish, but
            make them hatching lightest toward the light then a little darker
            next &amp; finally a little blacker to better make project &amp;
            come out.</p>
        <p>***</p>
        <p>In distemper do not mix your different colors together for this makes
            them die, but use each separately. And in order that they do not dry
            &amp; that you have time to soften, moisten the back of the canvas.
        </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The author-practitioner here associates Italian practice with distemper,
        as evidenced by the requirement for hatching which corresponds to the
        manner of shading he prescribes for the final shadows in the distemper
        painting of a face. We may assume that the Flemish technique he
        discusses is oil painting. During the sixteenth century a majority of
        Italian painters turned to oil painting, which had long been the
        dominant technique in northern Europe. It is therefore interesting to
        note that the author-practitioner, at the end of the sixteenth century,
        still associates protein and water-based media with Italian painting
        practice.</p>
    <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The process for painting a face in distemper described by the
        author-practitioner has the potential for success. The favorable outcome
        of my reconstructions depended, to a certain extent, on my own prior
        experience with painting. Someone without any paint handling experience
        would probably find different results. This was my first effort at using
        a glue medium, and over the short course of this reconstruction, I was
        able to significantly improve my handling of the paint so that between
        the application of the first shadow layer and that of the first
        carnation layer, my movements began to feel more instinctive, and the
        experience of engaging with the materials brought about less
        frustration. During the application of the second carnation layer, I
        experienced relative confidence, control, and some fluidity. Such
        progress indicates the method would become more effective and successful
        over time as one’s skills improved.</p>
    <p>The author-practitioner’s instructions fit into a European tradition of
        painting in protein- and glue-based media that stretched from the
        Medieval period through to at least the seventeenth century. The system
        of painting described in “Face in distemper,” and corroborated by my
        textual research and hands-on work in the laboratory, is very similar to
        the process of painting in glue described by Jill Dunkerton in 1991.<a

        skin. However, a great deal of further experimentation and research
        would be necessary to draw firm conclusions.</p>

                <p>Marika Spring notes that Mantegna worked slightly differently
                    in distemper to Massys or Bouts, for instance. Mantegna’s
                    distemper paintings in the National Gallery London have a
                    gesso ground, even if very thin. There is also more
                    substance to Mantegna’s paint than the glue distemper works
                    by Bouts or Massys. “Materials and Techniques in 15th- and

                    concentration seemed appropriate based on a review of
                    conservation science literature (in which samples seem to
                    range between 5% and 10%) and the fact that this is a
                    concentration considered appropriate for sizing canvases. A
                    1:10 ratio of rabbit skin glue to water solution, previously
                    prepared for sizing panels, was used, which was prepared as
                    follows: 50 g of rabbit skin glue was soaked overnight in
                    250 ml of water (i.e., 20% concentration). The next day, 250
                    ml of water was added to the solution (diluting it to a 10%
                    concentration). It was then heated in a bain-marie to
                    between 40 and 60°C.<a href="#fnref31"

                <p>Regarding the size layer, it is possible that a thinner layer
                    of less concentrated glue size would have worked, or one
                    without an addition of chalk; as conservator Andrea Rothe
                    has written, for distemper on linen paintings “although the

                <p>Mayerne's recipe makes clear that either glue, egg white, or
                    gum could be used for painting in distemper (<em>pour
                        peindre a destrempe</em>): “Since paints made with glue,
                    egg white, or gum are much darker in the damp state than
                    when they dry, one should, after the canvas has been
                    undercoated, dampen it from behind and paint on it. Also
                    when improving [that is, painting over] a tempera picture,
                    dampen the painting from behind, so the penetrating moisture
                    makes the colors on the canvas appear as they are in the
                    pots or shells and the eyes will not be deceived and the
                    improvement will not have unequal places, then paint as you

                <p>Marika Spring notes that it is particularly unusual to find
                    the mention of jet in a craft treatise. While she has often
                    found coal blacks of different types when carrying out
                    technical analyses, and jet could probably be said to fall

                <p>For instance in my reconstruction, the paint from the first
                    layers soaked into the canvas and were visible on the
                    reverse, something that Dunkerton describes: “Because the
                    technique did not involve the use of a ground the paint
                    seems to have partially soaked into the canvas, the pigment
                    particles becoming to some extent incorporated into the
                    fibres of the fabric. This can lead to the appearance of an
                    image on the reverse of the canvas, sometimes visible even
                    when the painting has been lined.” I believe this is what
                    the author-practitioner refers to when he speaks of the
                    bistre staining the canvas like rust. Jill Dunkerton,
