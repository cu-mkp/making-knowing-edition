        <div>
            <p>The hourglass had symbolic valences in early modern culture
                which, in the historiography, have often eclipsed its practical
                aspects, such as those involved in creating “powder for
                hourglasses” from lead and salt as described on fol. <a
                   href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/10r/f/10r/tl"><u>10r</u></a>
                of Ms. Fr. 640. This essay situates the entry among other
                medieval and early modern recipes for hourglass powder, which
                make use of a variety of ingredients (including pulverized
                eggshells, coral, and marble “grease”) and appear in texts
                ranging from fourteenth-century marital instructions to an
                eighteenth-century guide to maritime navigation. The entry in
                Ms. Fr. 640 sheds light on the fluidity between domestic and
                urban space in early modern Europe, the frugal and experimental
                quality of the domestic setting in this period, and even the
                material referents of certain metaphors in early modern
                religious writing.</p>

    <p>The symbolic valence of hourglasses has now superseded their practical
        use-value: their status as a visual icon—in <em>vanitas</em> paintings,
        for example, as a reminder of human mortality—is more prevalent today
        than their function in a practical context. This, however, was not
        always the case, as the recipe for hourglass sand on fol. <a
           href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/10r/f/10r/tl"><u>10r</u></a>
        in BnF Ms. Fr. 640 makes plain. What might this recipe be doing in the
        working manuscript of a sixteenth-century French practitioner? Research
        and reconstruction on the recipe for “powder for hourglasses” gave us
        valuable insights into the flexibility of ingredients in early modern
        recipes, the material referents of certain metaphors in early modern
        religious literature, and the experimental activities of domestic
        settings in this period.</p>
    <h2 id="reconstruction">Reconstruction</h2>
    <p>The recipe for “Powder for hourglasses” requires two ingredients: a pound
        of lead and “ground common salt” (<em>sel commun</em>).<a href="#fn1"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref1"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> We used a “Sherpa Pink” natural
        Himalayan salt that was already present in the lab (<i><u>Fig. 1</u></i>).<a href="#fn2"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref2"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> As for tools, it calls for the
        use of an iron tool to stir the molten lead mixture (presumably because
        iron has a higher melting point than lead) and a marble slab on which to
        grind the lead-salt mixture if it is too “coarse.” We approximated the
        iron tool with a spool of tightly-wound iron wire (<i><u>Fig. 2</u></i>). Although a marble slab was available in the lab, we used a granite
        slab.</p>

    <p>The first step was to finely pulverize the salt with a mortar and pestle
        (<i><u>Fig. 3</u></i>). During the grinding process, we found that salt
        could indeed be reduced to a consistency that felt velvety rather than
        granular, although this required working the salt against the wall of
        the mortar for a fairly sustained period. The amount of salt mentioned
        in the recipe is four ounces, however our final, most successful trial
        required only 25 g of salt in combination with a pound of lead, much
        less than the four ounces. Perhaps the author-practitioner meant to
        write dram (ʒ) rather than ounce (℥).<a href="#fn3"

    <p>After grinding the salt into what we considered a suitably fine powder,
        we melted down the pound of lead (which was a surprisingly small amount,
        due to the metal’s density) (<i><u>Fig. 4</u></i>). Given lead’s
        relatively low melting point, the metal became molten within a matter of
        minutes. As the recipe stipulates that one should “skim” the molten lead
        and remove any “filth” from it, we removed the dross using a small piece
        of paper and a spoon (we found this somewhat akin to skimming off the
        film of milk or cream that can form on coffee left to sit).<a

    <p>A few minutes after the addition of the first measure of salt, the
        mixture clearly began to “incorporate,” and it became more resistant to
        our stirring. At the same time, what looked like powdery, grey grains
        were beginning to form on the surface of the crucible. At this stage, we
        poured the mixture into a stainless steel dish (<i><u>Fig. 5</u></i>).
        We found that some of the lead had not incorporated with the salt, but
        had instead solidified at the bottom of the crucible; we therefore
        decided to repeat the previous steps of the recipe again, melting the
        lead remaining in the crucible and combining with more salt in order to
        yield as much “powder” as possible. After the second addition of salt,
        the remainder of the lead incorporated, and we poured it onto the dish
        along with the first batch of lead-salt mixture.</p>

    <p>Before we began to work the mixture on the granite slab, as stipulated in
        the recipe, we decided to sieve it, in order to separate the largest
        pieces from the very fine powder, the former of which we would work on
        reducing into smaller pieces first. Removing the pieces of lead-salt
        mixture that did not pass through the fine sieve we used, we set these
        onto the granite slab (also placed inside the fume hood), and began to
        grind them with a pestle (the instrument one should use for this process
        is not specified in the manuscript, so we decided to make use of the
        pestle we had previously been using to grind our “common salt.”</p>
    <p>At this stage, however, we discovered that the larger pieces of material
        that we were trying to grind down into powder were very resistant.
        Indeed, this material seemed to be solid pellets of lead, rather than
        lead and salt. After a few minutes of work, it seemed that we were not
        going to get anywhere trying to grind down pure lead, so we decided to
        just work with the powder that had passed through the sieve.</p>
    <p>The next step in the process, washing the powder in water and “throwing
        out” the powder that settles on the surface of the liquid, was one about
        which we were initially very sceptical: the consistency of the lead-salt
        mixture seemed it would work well as hourglass sand. It was velvety and,
        while not totally impalpable, sifted easily through our (gloved) hands
        without sticking to them. We were unsure what would happen to our
        mixture if we washed it in water: if we had just combined molten lead
        with salt, and the reaction that had occurred was purely physical rather
        than chemical, wouldn’t passing the mixture through water simply
        dissolve the salt?</p>
    <p>We were so incredulous about the efficacy of this “washing” action that
        we decided to only use half of the powder we had produced from the
        lead-salt incorporation. We decanted about half of the velvety lead-salt
        powder into a white plastic bowl, and simply poured in lukewarm water
        from the tap. The effect was immediate: the water turned a very deep
        grey, while our powder remained at the bottom, now a sludge-like
        consistency (<i><u>Fig. 6</u></i>). It now became apparent that the
        powder would settle at the bottom of the bowl, and could be washed
        without actually disturbing the powder at the bottom. We were reminded
        of Ken Albala’s adjuration against scepticism when recreating historical
        recipes, and the importance of avoiding the temptation to amend
        processes and actions in accord with what seems more logical to our
        modern-day perspectives. “[To] learn about historical…procedures,” as
        Albala writes, “we must trust what is on the page.”<a href="#fn5"

    <p>The lack of reaction between the water and the lead-salt mixture might
        also explain why the substance was used as hourglass sand. Willem Morzer
        Bruyns and Stuart Talbot, subscribers to an Oxford-based mailing list
        (RETE) dedicated to the history of scientific instruments, both pointed
        out via email correspondence that “it was essential that, whatever
        materials were used in sand glasses, they had to be non-hygroscopic.”<a
           href="#fn6"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref6"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> Hygroscopy refers to a
        substance’s ability to attract and hold water molecules from its
        surrounding environment, through either adsorption or absorption—sugar
        is an example of a hygroscopic substance, as is salt (NaCl). This was
        important due to the fact that glass-blowers could not blow hourglasses
        in one piece until the middle of the eighteenth century: up until that
        point, the two bulbs were blown separately and held together by sealing
        wax or pitch. Any moisture that entered this join could compromise the
        hourglass’s accuracy.</p>
    <p>We repeated the washing process six times, until the water was running as
        close to clear as we thought likely to achieve. Finally, we strained the
        last batch of water into a bowl with cheesecloth stretched over the top
        of it, and put our lead-salt mixture that did not pass through the
        cheesecloth into a small bowl and left it in a fume hood to dry.
        Examining the composition of our newly-washed powder, what had before
        felt smooth and velvety in texture now looked like minuscule lead
        spheres and felt much more granular to the touch. The texture of our
        washed powder actually tallies with recent research in the mechanics of
        hourglass sand flow, which has suggested that the best material for sand
        are “ballotini,” which are “tiny [glass] beads of subspherical shape.”<a
           href="#fn7"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref7"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> They are ca. 40–160 microns in
        diameter, and because of their round edges they flow smoothly through
        hourglasses.<a href="#fn8"

           role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> Although our lead-salt mixture
        was not composed of grains that small, they were roughly spherical in

    </h2>
    <p>The historian A. J. Turner has stated that “the origin of the
        sand-glass…is historically a mystery.”<a href="#fn9"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref9"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> Although the device has a
        precedent in the ancient Egyptian water clock known as the clepsydra,
        the hourglass as we know it appears to be a medieval invention and has
        “a surprisingly brief history.”<a href="#fn10"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref10"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> The earliest depiction has
        symbolic import: it appears in a series of frescoes by Ambrogio
        Lorenzetti dating to 1338 in the Palazzo Pubblico of Siena, entitled
        <em>The Allegory of Good and Bad Government</em>, and it is held by the
        female figure of Temperance, one of the six virtues of good government.
        This symbolic meaning resonated into the Renaissance, when it became
        ubiquitous as a <em>memento mori</em> in vanitas paintings of the period
        (<i><u>Fig. 8</u></i>). The hourglass also appears as one of the
        accoutrements of an embodied Death, for instance, in Albrecht Dürer’s
        copper engraving <em>Ritter, Tod, und Teufel</em> (Knight, Death, and
        the Devil, 1513), the grisly Death figure clutches an hourglass in a
        skeletal hand, a reminder of the brevity of the Knight’s life (<i><u>Fig. 9</u></i>).</p>

    <p>The hourglass is also found in the <em>Trachtenbuch</em> (“costume book”)
        of Matthäus Schwarz (1497–1574), a German accountant who worked for the
        powerful Augsburg merchant Jakob Fugger. The <em>Trachtenbuch</em> is
        Schwarz’s record of the clothing he had made and wore between the years
        1520 and 1560, a lavish series of more than 100 watercolors depicting
        Schwarz in various garments. In one of these images, Schwarz is depicted
        wearing an hourglass attached on his yellow hose to his calf (<i><u>Fig. 10</u></i>, <i><u>Fig. 11</u></i>), which the accompanying text
        identifies as an eight-minute hourglass (“mit einem uhr am schenkel von
        acht minuten”). In this image, the hourglass seems to function as a
        vanitas object, gesturing toward the larger <em>mundus transit</em>
        trope but perhaps also to the ephemerality of the fashions that Schwarz
        is recording (indeed, the “fickleness of fashion and the vanity of
        sumptuous apparel” was well-trodden ground in early modern sermons).<a

    <p>Both the hourglass and fashion, then, seem to act as a reminder that
        glory and life are fleeting. Schwarz himself appeared to be fascinated
        by the passage of time, which he marked by having portraits painted of
        himself. On his 29th birthday Hans Maler zu Schwaz painted Schwarz with
        an hourglass around his neck (<i><u>Fig. 12</u></i>), and a later
        portrait from 1542, painted by Christoph Amberger, includes Schwarz’s
        horoscope (next to the glass of wine) and records Schwarz’s exact age
        (45 years, 30 days, and 2¾ hours) as well as the time of the painting,
        4:15pm on 22 March 1542 (<i><u>Fig. 13</u></i>). Perhaps in Schwarz’s
        case, the hourglass does not so much function as a <em>memento mori</em>
        but more as part of a celebration of the power of art “to fix in both
        time and space something that [is] ephemeral and changeable.”<a

    <p>The first extant <em>textual</em> references to hourglasses, however,
        occur within a maritime context. In a receipt dating to 1345, Thomas de
        Stetesham, Clerk of the King’s Ship called La George, is recorded as
        buying sixteen “glass horologes” while in Flanders.<a href="#fn13"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref13"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> Thirty-five years later, an
        inventory of the personal effects of Charles V of France upon his death
        in September 1380, describes an item located in the king’s study at his
        chateau at St. Germaine en Laye: “Item ung grant orloge de mer, de deux
        grans fiolles plains de sablon, en ung grant estuy de boys garn
        d’archal” (Item a large sea clock, with two large phials filled with

           role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
    <p>Hourglasses were ideal for measuring time during marine journeys, as the
        movement of the sand between the two glass ampoules was not affected by
        the movement of the ship (unlike a water clock). A. J. Turner, however,
        has suggested that accounts of the hourglass originating primarily in a
        maritime navigational context do not properly represent its diverse
        early usage: identifying the first nine allusions to the hourglass or
        “sandglass,” Turner reveals that these objects fulfilled diverse
        functions: they were given as wedding presents, for instance, and played
        a role in civic life. Indeed, one Swiss town council order established
        that “the tolling of the town bell for the quarter and half hours should
        be regulated by a sand glass.”<a href="#fn15"

    <h2 id="recipes-for-hourglass-powder">Recipes for Hourglass Powder</h2>
    <p>The earliest recipe for hourglass sand that we located was in <em>Le
            ménagier de Paris,</em> the so-called “Goodman of Paris,” written in
        the last decade of the fourteenth century by a wealthy Parisian burgher,
        ostensibly for the instruction of his wife. Under the miscellaneous
        heading “Other small things that be needful,” and immediately preceded
        by a “cure” for toothache and followed by “Poisons for slaying a stag or
        a boar,” a recipe for hourglass sand appears:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>TO MAKE SAND FOR HOURGLASSES. Take the grease which comes from the
            sawdust of marble when those great tombs of black marble be sawn,
            then boil it well in wine like a piece of meat and skim it, and then
            set it to dry in the sun; and boil, skim and dry nine times; and
            thus it will be good.<a href="#fn16"
               class="footnote-ref"
               id="fnref16"
               role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>Although the ingredients detailed here
        differ from those in Ms. Fr. 640, the steps are analogous to the Ms. Fr.
        640 recipe: heating and skimming are both required, and the fact that
        the three principal steps of the recipe (boiling, skimming, and drying)
        need to be conducted a total of nine times suggests that a very fine
        powder should be the end product, just as in our manuscript’s recipe.
        Most interesting, however, is the placement of this recipe for hourglass
        sand in a domestic <em>vade mecum</em>, suggesting that the production
        of this substance was, in the late fourteenth century, part of a
        standard repertoire of household chores. Indeed, as we found, the making
        of “powder for hourglasses,” does not appear to have been particularly
        difficult.</p>
    <p>These instructions can be compared to two seventeenth-century recipes.
        The first appears in Richard Polter’s <em>A Pathway to Perfect
            Sayling</em> (first published 1605, reprinted in 1644), a popular,
        albeit outdated, guide to maritime navigation composed by a Master of
        the King’s Ships. Polter points to the difficulty in constructing an
        hourglass that will measure the passage of time accurately: “they cannot
        be made without their imperfections, and need to be most carefully made,
        and by the precisest workmen.” Although Polter is likely referring here
        primarily to the difficulty in creating the two bulbs of the hourglass,
        the sand used in the device also needed careful consideration. Polter
        goes on to discuss the inaccuracies that result from using a “metal”
        sand in an hourglass, stating that such a substance</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>will rust somewhat, and be sometimes moyster, then at other times,
            likewise the hole that the sande runneth thorough, will grow wider
            with the force of the sand, the rather being violated by the surges
            of the sea: which imperfections considered, the glasse must needs
            deliver the time, sometime shorter, and sometime longer.<a
               href="#fn17"
               class="footnote-ref"
               id="fnref17"
               role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>So while Polter is attuned to the problems
        that can arise from it, the metallic sand he is discussing seems fairly
        similar in composition to that detailed in Ms. Fr. 640.</p>
    <p>The four-book <em>Horologi elementari</em> of Domenico Martinelli,
        published in Venice in 1669, features a more extensive list of potential
        ingredients for hourglass sand. In this text, Martinelli—born in Lucca,
        Tuscany, and now principally remembered as an architect—details the
        construction of various timepieces, including one of the first
        descriptions of the cuckoo clock. One of the timepieces he discusses is
        the hourglass, including its sand. Martinelli writes, “What could serve
        very well is ground marble, or the sand left by rivers…but above all
        these I esteem best the ones made from lead, or from tin.”<a
           href="#fn18"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref18"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> In contrast to Polter’s text,
        which speaks only of the “metal” powder that can be used in hourglasses,
        Martinelli claims that various substances would serve very well as
        hourglass sand—ground marble, as in the recipe from <em>Le
            ménagier</em>, or the “sand left by rivers”— although the best, he
        concedes, is made from lead or tin. The architect also foregrounds the
        importance of a fine, dry sand, writing that it must be “well-dried, so
        that with the humidity the grains of it do not unite together.”<a

        sand.<a href="#fn21"

    <p>These many recipes and ingredients for hourglass sand indicate how
        widespread was the need for and knowledge about good hourglass sand.</p>
    <h2 id="constructing-hourglasses">Constructing Hourglasses</h2>
    <p>Once the sand was made, how was the hourglass constructed, and most
        importantly, how was it calibrated? We do not know how this happened in
        a domestic setting. But the hourglass-maker was clearly a common sight
        in an urban environment. In their 1568 so-called <em>Ständebuch</em>
        (generally known in English as the “Book of Trades”), portraying
        artisans in their workshops, Hans Sachs and Jost Amman included a
        clockmaker. Although the woodcut appears to depict a mechanical clock,
        the verse outlines the making of an hourglass, mentioning the use of
        clear glass filled with small-sized sand, and the wooden housing that
        helps hold the two bulbs tightly together (<i><u>Fig. 14</u></i>).<a

    <p>On the following pages, Weigel gives a short history of clock making,
        outlining three stages from sundial (impractical because it could not be
        used in cloudy weather), to the water or sand clock (flawed because they
        must be capable of being seen, which makes them useless in a dark
        night), through to the <em>Schlag-</em>uhren (chiming clocks), which use
        steel springs or a weight, and can be heard as well as seen.<a

           role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a> Citing Pancirollus’s description
        of the water clock, Weigel goes on to state that he cannot say when the
        sand clock first appeared: “wann und von wem,” he writes, “diese neue
        Art der Stunden-Gläser hervor gebracht worden ist mir unwissend” (when

        Nuremberg, where four types of “Sand-Uhren” (sand clocks) were required
        of any master:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>(1) a small clock with lead sand, (2) a clock with four glasses of

            clock of three hours, likewise filled with white sand, (4) a clock

    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>His list, which illustrates the diversity
        of hourglasses available at this time, also notes that they are varied
        in size, and then provides rich detail about the construction of
        hourglasses:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>When it comes to size, one finds those that are barely finger long,
            that nevertheless run for a full hour; others measure a good ell
            long, that one must turn after three, four, or more hours [...]. The
            sand is either red when it is dug up, and is washed by the sand
            clockmaker, dried or desiccated and burned in a pan so that the
            color becomes nice and red, and then is sifted through many sieves,
            one narrower than the next, up to twenty times. Or, the sand is
            white and burned from egg shells and then treated as explained with
            the red sand. The tin and the lead is similarly made into a sand so
            that the glasses—to indicate the hours correctly—are filled with it.
            The clocks’ housings are usually made from wood or brass and there
            are some of the latter kind which one can fold up to carry them
            safely and unbroken in a bag [...]. And when all this, glasses,
            sand, and casings are made, the clock is put together in the
            following manner: one glass is filled with sand, the brass sheet is
            laid on top, then a small hole is made in it with a needle or an
            awl, the other glass is set on top and connected with pitch. Then
            one puts the clocks made in this way together, lifts it all up and
            turns the measuring clock [<em>Eichuhr</em>]. When this one runs
            out, then the new ones are all turned, opened up again under light,
            and, what has not yet run out, is poured out. Then it is closed with
            pitch again, string is wound around it, and it is placed in the
            housing.<a href="#fn27"

        Reuse of Materials in Daily Life</h2>
    <p>While the techniques of production might be similar—the repetition of
        several purification steps to ensure a very fine sand—the ingredients
        for the sand are diverse, including marble dust, lead, tin, river sand,
        and eggshells. These apparently miscellaneous ingredients suggest that
        the sand could be produced from almost any materials that a person had
        to hand. Thus, lead and salt may be the principal ingredients of the
        author-practitioner’s recipe because these two substances would have
        been in ample supply in his workshop, and eggshells may have been used
        in households because they would be both easily accessible and an
        efficient use of domestic waste. While the marble grease that features
        in the recipe from <em>Le ménagier</em> seems a little more exotic than
        lead or eggshells, we should bear in mind that great marble tombs were
        being constructed in Paris in the fourteenth century. Moreover, this
        interesting use of waste material brings to light the role such
        construction projects played in the daily life of a city, an insight
        that would not be available from other sources.</p>
    <p>The notion that hourglass sand might be patched together with any scraps
        of material readily available tallies with citywide changes in methods
        of waste disposal. In late sixteenth-century England, for example, but
        from the fourteenth century in many other European cities, local
        authorities appointed “scavengers” or “gunge-farmers” to patrol the
        streets of urban areas with carts and tumbrels, removing waste which was
        then often used to sustain an artisanal trade in waste materials.<a

    <p>If the ingredients for hourglass sand could be constituted from domestic
        waste at the householder’s disposal, hourglass sand could be produced
        frequently and with ease, thus cementing its importance in the fabric of
        daily life, where people would regularly encounter hourglasses. These
        timepieces had become increasingly widespread in Europe during the
        fifteenth and sixteenth centuries—referred to by the Delalandes as “the
        golden age of hourglasses”—and were used to measure intervals such as
        the length of sermons, cooking time, and breaks from labor.<a

           role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a> The hourglass was also employed
        in somewhat more specialist domains: it marked the length of lectures
        for the students at Oxford University, curtailed “the prolix orator’s
        flow of words” in law-courts and the House of Commons, and even helped
        medical practitioners in measuring pulses.<a href="#fn32"

    <h2 id="domestic-and-artisanal-spaces">Domestic and Artisanal Spaces</h2>
    <p>The household production of hourglass sand points also to the
        interpenetration of domestic and artisanal spaces that characterized the
        period. Speaking of early modern England, Amanda Flather has claimed
        that the boundary between home and work was remarkably blurred, stating
        that “in towns, artisans often had [their] ‘workshops’ attached to the
        main dwelling house,” as an outgrowth of or appendix to domestic space,
        rather than as a separate, fully-fledged “creative arena” in its own
        right.<a href="#fn33"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref33"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a> Relatedly, Paula Hohti has
        argued for the importance of domestic space in the forging of artisanal
        identity in sixteenth-century Siena.<a href="#fn34"

           id="fnref34"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
    <p>It was in the kitchen, however, that this separation between domestic
        space and artisanal workshop was most porous. As Simon Werrett has
        observed in his history of recycling in early modern science, the
        kitchen could make quite a serviceable stand-in for a custom laboratory
        space, particularly given the access it provided to fire and ingredients
        which often had both culinary and chemical uses.<a href="#fn35"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref35"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>35</sup></a> Ms. Fr. 640 and other books of
        recipes, such as Hugh Plat’s <em>The Jewel House of Art and Nature</em>
        (1594), mingled recipes for sugar-paste with metal molding techniques.
        Recipe books also often encouraged women to further blur the boundaries
        between kitchen and apothecary by preparing medicines in their kitchens.
        Elaine Leong’s study of medicine production in the early modern home of
        Elizabeth Freke, for instance, shows that her recipes were primarily
        based on “common herbs and spices,”<a href="#fn36"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref36"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>36</sup></a> and that Freke used common
        household staples, such as “butter, eggs, and cream” in salves and

           id="fnref37"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>37</sup></a> Recipes for hourglass sand made
        from eggshells further spotlight the interpenetration of these two
        spaces. The domestic production of hourglass sand suggests that these
        timepieces were a significant, even necessary, part of the fabric of
        daily life, meriting a place in the economy and manufacturing processes
        of the household.</p>
    <h2 id="the-hourglass-as-physical-and-symbolic-presence">The Hourglass as
        Physical and Symbolic Presence </h2>
    <p>The fact that the hourglass was used to measure the length of sermons can
        perhaps help us to understand more comprehensively why the device
        features so prominently in sixteenth- and seventeenth-century English
        religious literature. References to the hourglass are particularly
        prevalent in printed sermons, emphasizing its symbolic function as a
        reminder of man’s mortality: for instance, in a sermon of 1641 by
        Jeremiah Burroughs, the author states that “all men in worldly honours
        are like an houreglasse; now this end is uppermost, by and by this end
        is done.”<a href="#fn38"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref38"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>38</sup></a> The hourglass is also often
        coupled with the candle, an emblem of the fragility of life. In the
        Puritan church leader Richard Baxter’s <em>A Christian directory</em>
        (1673), Baxter admonishes his reader to “remember that as soon as you
        begin to live, you are hasting toward the end of your lives: Even as a
        Candle as soon as it beginneth to burn, and the Hourglass as soon as it
        is turned, is wasting, and hasting to its end.”<a href="#fn39"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref39"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>39</sup></a> This pairing is also found in
        Thomas Bentley’s <em>The Fift</em> [Fifth] <em>Lamp of Virginitie</em>
        (1582), in which a prayer “to be vsed by old women” features the line
        “the houre glas is almost run, my candle is almost burned out, and thine
        everlasting iudgement draweth on.”<a href="#fn40"
           class="footnote-ref"
           id="fnref40"
           role="doc-noteref"><sup>40</sup></a> The obvious explanation for the
        hourglass’s recurrence in sermons is thus its symbolic significance, but
        the fact that an hourglass, measuring the length of the sermon might be
        standing beside the preacher, could have amplified the import of that
        sermon. Recognizing that the production of the hourglass could be a
        domestic chore, and a ubiquitous part of quotidian life, makes even
        richer our understanding of the symbolic significance of the hourglass
        in early modern culture. It was both a <em>memento mori</em> and a
        tangible, physical presence woven into daily life and the affairs of the
        household.</p>

                    France or Florence, and it is based on a pound of 16 ounces.
                    A dram in this system is equal to 1.77 metric grams. The
                    apothecaries’ system, on the other hand, divides the pound
                    in 12 ounces and was typically reserved for indicating
                    weights and measurements in medicinal or scientific recipes;
                    in this system, the dram’s mass is greater: 3.89 grams. If
                    the author-practitioner meant dram rather than an ounce, the
                    recipe calls for either 7.08 g of salt (the avoirdupois
                    dram) or 15.56 g (the apothecaries’ dram). Our 25 g of salt
                    does not correlate exactly with either dram measurement, but
                    it does suggest that the apothecaries’ dram is being

                <p>Sand itself, ironically, tends not to be used in hourglass
                    sand production because its grains are too angular, thus
                    preventing smooth flow. Ronald Smeltzer, in email

                    why the use of sand is not widespread: “Perhaps an advantage
                    of not using sand if a softer material was available is that
                    since sand and glass are the same material (silica), the
                    falling sand could slightly grind away the glass, thus

                    Interestingly, some literature of the period suggests that
                    measuring sermons by the hour is a Catholic practice. In
                    Thomas Hart’s <em>The foundation and rise of many of the
                        practices, customs, and formallities of the priests,
                        lawyers, and people of England examined</em> (London,
                    1659), Hart asks his reader “does not [sic] the Papists say
                    their Mass by the Hour-glass?” (8). It is possible that
                    Thomas Carlyle is referring to a similar practice when he
                    asserts, at the beginning of <em>The French Revolution</em>,
                    that “Priests’ Litanies [are] read or chanted at fixed
                    money-rate per hour,” which may have been measured by an
                    hourglass. Thomas Carlyle, <em>The French Revolution</em>:
