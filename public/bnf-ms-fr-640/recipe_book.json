I have experienced that grinding azur d’esmail with egg yolk & next washing it in several waters is good. However, it loses a little of its vividness in the grinding of it. I have also washed it in several waters &, when it had settled a little, I removed the water, still q blue, with a sponge and squeezed it into another vessel thus where it settled, & from the residue I had the ash, flower and subtlest part of the azure without grinding it, which is the best, for in the grinding of it, it loses some of its tint. Those who make it in Germany compound it like enamel, in large pieces which they pestle, & pass through several sieves & wash.To make azures beautiful, they wash or soak them in a rock water, as they call it; it is a water distilled from mines where azure or vert d'azur is found, which distills naturally through the veins of the mountain or is distilled through an alembic par from mineral stones of azure or copper.Azure ash are only good for landscapes because they die in oil. Only true azure holds on. Azur d’esmail cannot be worked if it is too coarse. Try it, therefore, on the fingernail or the oil palette. If it  happens to be sandy, do not grind it except with the egg yolk or, better yet, wash it in clear water & with a sponge remove the colored water after it starts to go to the bottom, and in this manner you will extract the very delicate flower, which will be easy to work with."},"p011v_1":{"id":"p011v_1","folioID":"p011v","name":"Applying the color of Damascene steel on knives","content":"Applying the color of Damascene steel on knives\nRub the steel with common aquis fortis mixed with earth.

Alchemists are confident they can melt it with realgar, lead or orpiment. But without all that, some have found a way to melt not only brittle iron, like that used for iron pots, but also soft iron such as pig or ingot iron, which are the most difficult ones to work with. For this result they make a furnace that is one pan and a half wide and two pans deep, and the tuelle, which is the barrel marked A where the bellows' pipes fit, has to be placed midway through the depth of the furnace so that there is one pan of the furnace opening on the tuelle and one pan under it.Each square pan of the furnace's opening can hold one quintal and a half, and the round furnace pan can hold two quintals.The iron smiths, to make the iron run, at the opening of the forge, place two or three handfuls of wallwort in the direction they want to make the cast iron run, and that makes the iron wonderfully ductile and flowy. It is necessary that the tuelle is inserted through to the middle of the furnace opening, which is a main clue for the secret because the wind will hit the edge and the wall, which makes up the center of the furnace and in that manner, it spreads equally everywhere, as well as above, like flames in a reverberatory oven, and thus heats much more; because if the wind hits the melted or ready to be melted matter perpendicularly, it would cool it down and it would stop it from running and melting. It is also necessary for the bellows to be activated by jumps and by the water stream as happens at forges, because in this way, bellows are activated with great precision and great speed, which the strength of workers could not duplicate. As you can see, the wall is thus raised up and the furnace is laid on the ground, at the edge of which you dig a pit, like at other forges. In order to put the moulds you want to cast inside, and for this purpose, you unstop the opening that you made at the bottom of the furnace to allow the melted matter to flow. You will be able to melt two quintals of iron each time and, in order to do this, you will choose the biggest charcoal you will find and put a measure of it at the bottom on the surface area of the furnace and pile up from the bottom to the top of the wall, in the shape of an upside down V.Some make a mould of the same size as the piece, then immerse it, then beat a soft iron piece cut to size, and when this bit is red hot, they beat it into the mould and round it out with a large file.

It should not be any farther. Its cannonball usually weighs 40 lb of the King's standard. The fowler weighs 25 quintals and is a small, short cannon for fighting the casemates of moats and at close range. It shoots large cannonballs that weigh, like the others, 40 lb of the King's standard. The breech is two balls and a quarter thick; the mouth is one ball and a third thick. Its load is similar to the biggest ones, that is to say 20 pounds. And if you want to try it, don't overload it, for it would damage it. And the first time and the first five or six shots, it is better not to load it completely, it adjusts itself. What one can do in such a case, is to load 20 pounds of fine arquebus powder instead of ordinary cannon powder. And four good horses are enough to carry it. They are easy to use and on a small distance they are as strong as the big ones even for private houses and small billattes and less important fortresses. They are less prone to breaking than other cannons because they are short. What gives strength to the powder and increases the danger of breaking is the length of the cannon, because the powder burns entirely and its force is held longer within the longer cannon than the short one. The fowler is usually seven to eight pans long. It is true that this measure is a Montpellier pan and not a King's pan, the latter is not used for good cannon founding. Since the Montpellier pan is shorter, cannons made using this measure are shorter, but compensate in thickness the ones made using the King's pan, which are longer, but more fragile. The Fowler's strength for battery is 80 pans. The great cannon, because of its cannonball's weight, ranges not further than a thousand or twelve hundred paces without landing, and usually makes 3 jumps. Fowlers have only a short range efficiency. You recognize a cannon's good alloy when you see it. If there is green color on the surface becomes red, it means they are made of a sufficient quantity of rosette. Otherwise, the cannon's metal will appear whitish. If you don't see it, just scratch it and you will see it.  The good alloy for the cannon is three pans of rosette and one of big bells' fine metal, where there is more rosette than in small bells' metal. This metal usually costs 15 pounds and fine rosette 15 or 16. Montpellier pan is equivalent to six King's inches, which is equivalent to two ordinary.

Very often, you shoot as strong as possible so the assailed despising the battery do not fix it. Usually, there are not many gun-turrets or other defenses. And when a breach is made at the strongest and the cannon replaced, it will surprise the assailed. One should approach fortified towns at night, but  . The workers bring gabions and once these are displayed, some boards or plank are put behind gabions to keep the workers safe while behind, they fill the gabions with some earth by means of their shovels.

And once you have shot a cannon ball at the defense, the gabions the workers display the boards to make a plain ground or a platform of four fingers or half a foot thick.

The space between the pieces is equivalent to the width of two gabions. As long as the battery lasts, gunners sleep and eat close to a cannon. In small spaces, one does not bother to dig trenches to reach the pieces but display many high gabions and run towards them. In large places one digs trenches.

But they taper it more or less one line on each side from the middle ring to the mouth ring, always using a compass for their measures from the straight line which they draw in the modelle en papier whatever pattern. And this reduction is consequently equivalent to seven or eight quintals less. And this does not make the piece less secure. This is done for big pieces, but for pieces smaller than the mid-one, one has to keep the aforesaid proportion and make the piece in one straight line from one end to the other. Usually the trunnions are situated one foot away from the middle ring in the direction of the breech. But since some gunners prefer a piece heavier at the front for it is easier to adjust and for that purpose, it is sufficient to place the trunnions closer to the breech and further away from the middle. On the contrary if you want to make it heavier at the bottom, you will place the trunnions closer to the middle of the piece or forward in direction of the mouth. When you drill your piece make a fluted cast iron bar like a bed poster and and there must be sixteen flutes or notches in which you will fix sixteen well-even blades, so altogether they will cut and scrape similarly. Because should some not cut or scrape, there would be some waves and spaces in the cannon which would be bent and the piece might break in its middle.

In Spain, one ounce of grain gives worms that commonly make 15 lb. of silk. But from one once produced in France, they do not make but 10 or 12. Three ounces of grain are to produce such a quantity of worms, with which you will be able to furnish a room with three or 4 shelves of wide boards. They begin to shed their skin on their own around Easter. And to do this, one has to put them in a pine box, like the ones in which we put pellet, warmly among feather cushions. And in the beginning, they shed their skin as little black ants, and as soon as there are two or three without skin, they have to be given white mulberry leaves. And then arrange them on the boards. And three times per day, it is necessary to change the leaves for fresh ones. And if during the day there is any storm or rainy weather, cloudy and cool, one needs to keep in the room three or 4 embers and with glowing coal, and to light incense until the room is filled with its smoke. And when the weather is warm and serene, they produce more and better silk. Some worms make it whiter, others more yellowish. And even if it is white, it can be yellowed when it is extracted with hot water. From their birth until the moment they make their cocoons and prisons, worms sleep and rest 4 times, and each time they remain 4 or five days resting without eating, as if they were dying so as to be born again, because each one sheds their skin and begins by uncovering the head, then consequently, on different days, the rest of the body, and they go from white to grey, and from grey to white.

What comes next is the heel. The rest is the blade. The sides are the edge and the point. Certain blades, acute in point, have only one side filed in the middle & along the whole length, and are easy to break. Other blades are called of three molds or three grips, which have one good rise in the middle, but this elevation is flat as if it were acute in point but flattened. These ones are most certain. Others are called fluted, which are notched from the middle, & when it is along the whole length, they are just as easy to break as those acute in point and are more troublesome to burnish because the burnishing stick can't get in. But they make one specially that is narrow.  Making up the hilt of the sword are the pommel, the branches of the hilt and the cross-guard, which is this iron strip that closes off the guard and that is at the end of the heel to stop thrusts from sliding down the hilt. The rings are these two branches in half round that start from the eye of the guard and go all the way to the branch of the cross-guard.  The branch that crosses the hilt is called the body and this escutcheon, by which the sword enters the sheath and to which all the branches return, and which holds them, is called the eye of the guard. Following is the wood of the grip which one glues or more fittingly uses some mingled wax which is made of wax and pitch, for rosin would be too hard. He heats it lightly, then rubs the wood of the grip so that the tang takes hold, or the threads, otherwise, when a thread frays off, the whole thing will break all at once. With iron thread or dog skin, one also uses glue. The trimming set on the wood, which is made of silk or thread, is called the cord, which is made from two or three threads twined on the spinning wheel, or 4 if the silk is thin. A cord a little bigger holds better. The rivements, which are also made of silk at both ends of the grip, are called the buttons. Some grips are made of silk, seal skin, iron thread reheated with gold and fine and false silver thread & velvet thread. Iron thread is of less price and is most durable. Next is that of silk, if one does not have the convenience of being close to the sea in order to recover some dog skin, which is quite convenient. The good skin costs fifty or lx sous and makes 4 or five dozen grips. This one gives a good grip and a sure hand. To put it to work, if it is too hard, soak it for one or two hours in slightly lukewarm aqua fortis. Because if it were too hot, it would boil and spoil the skin. It is sewn with black thread.

And when the ashes are very hot, put the charcoal aside and put the hilt where the charcoal was, and cover it completely with ashes. And when the body, which is the main part of the hilt, is completely colored, flip it onto the other side. In that way, the grey cannot color it too dark, unless some hot coal touches it. Greying can be achieved in an ordinary fireplace, too, but there is a danger that it may sit there too long and make a crust which which will prevent the color from setting.

However, fresh calamine and only fresh calamine, which is blended with remelted latten, makes latten run, and allow a clean cast. Because calamine which is added to remelted latten is half-damaged compared with its natural state. This half-damaged calamine make latten porous and agitated because it has a tendency to evaporate. Thus add only very fresh calamine to melted latten. Make sure to cast your mold very hot, you mold must become red-hot, like molds to cast gold, silver, copper and metal.

The mold is made out of the aforementioned sand, common for all metals, when it is reheated, leave it to cool until you can put your finger in it without causing a breach in the gate of the cast. As for the lead, it is melted in a crucible with a bellows' fire until both the crucible and the lead are red.  When it gets to that state, cleanse it anew with charcoal or with a specially made scraper or with the pufts of the little bellows. This done, leave it to rest in it red state and you can even reheat it, then if you want, throw in a bit of resin to burn away the filth.

The same thing can be said for pure tin used for thin things.  And that way for doing pure tin is one ℥  of new lead for one lb. of the former.  Large molds must be put in a press held tightly between two layers of copper, and then bury the whole thing in sand, which is better than ashes, because being heavy, it will seal better.  Otherwise large molds are prone to open because the metal is heavy.  Some make square molds When the metal is thick, you do not need to cast as hot as when it is thin.

Rather than molding these animals immediately (except for snakes and lizards), keep them dead for a day a two so that they become easier to handle.

And then one brings them together, soldering the little branches and leaves of the rose bush to the stem of the rose, on which you will have purposefully left bits of the small branches.  Put your petal or rose as low as you can in your mould, because sand will always bring it up or raise it.  You can also mould several petals together, arranged one on top of the other, separating them some thread.  And for the look of the rose you can give a thin layer of melted butter on the back of the petals, but only on the outside petals, not the inside petals, to stiffen them and give them the strength to withstand, so that the wet sand does not stretch or spread them out more than necessary.  You can also mold well the leaves of a rosebush, strawberry plant and similar things, that are flat and can be flattened without being spoiled. For two castings, to open your mould, when it has been reheated and then clean the ashes out, make some vents, and you will be able to do several casts. This is the easiest way and you can also do the other.  And with little veins of wax that has been adapted and joined from leaf to leaf, you can make casts. You can even make a little vein of wax from the back of the first petal, which will join up with the main cast.  All of this will facilitate the casting process. The main thing is to let your reheated moulds cool down rather than cleaning them and blowing inside them to make the wax come out, because when the mold is hot, the ash almost attaches itself to it.  But when it is cold it, it detaches and leaves with air draft or when one draw in one's breath through the small opening. You can also give a little thickness at the ends of the stems that are holding up the petals, by lightly oiling them underneath with melted butter, because the petals are big and weigh heavily, and the stem made of lead or tin will not have enough strength to hold it.I would be of the opinion to mold the rose on its own with a bit of its stem close to its bud, and then to join the rose to a longer one a stem made of glazed brass, because the rose bloom is very big and heavy.Moisten your rose with spirits before placing it in the clay. Do not forget to oil the wax cast. And when you have thrown in your wet sand, blow heavily, until it begins to set.  The rose came out well.

One moulds the flower of the rose in a separate mould, casting it thickly so that it comes out more easily. Then one cuts the cast at the edges of the stem of the bud, in which you graft and solder a stalk of brass wire to which you also solder the leaves. But because this tin, being so thin, is hard to solder, and may melt some of the leaves and also the cast flowers;  you should consider that cast flowers, especially roses, are not beautiful without being painted, so one does not make the effort to solder them, but instead one grafts the pieces that you want to join together and glues them with fish glue that has been a little moistened and melted until thick. And so that it takes better, you heat the work in tin lightly and for a long time,  because if it is cold, the glue will not take.
