            "abstract": "Abstract: Fol. 29r_1 describes a method for creating stucco which the author-practitioner claims is versatile and inexpensive. This annotation conducts a material-based analysis of the entry, including a reconstruction following the instructions in this entry and a historical investigation of ancient and early modern stucco recipes and stucco use, to better situate the author-practitioner within his context. These comparisons reveal that the author-practitioner's recipe is apparently unusual. Moreover, investigating stucco highlights the author-practitioner's interest in ornamentation, his focus on using pre-existing patterns rather than creating new ones, and his possible first-hand experiences of making domestic and ephemeral decorative art.",
