<h1><strong>Stucco for Molding</strong></h1>
<p>Stucco is a type of plaster used to coat walls and to create wall and
ornamental moldings. The entry on fol. 29r_1, &quot;Stucco for Molding,&quot;
describes a process for creating this material and provides an
opportunity to examine varieties of early modern stucco to better
understand the aims of the author-practitioner. How do the materials and
techniques detailed in fol. 29r_1 compare to contemporaneous recipes
for &quot;stucco&quot;? What do they tell us about how the author-practitioner
intended to use this material, and, finally, do they allow insight into
whether he experimented with the stucco himself?</p>
<p>The entry includes more than one set of instructions. The first outlines
a straightforward process for making stucco from tragacanth gum and rye
flour, and then molding it. In the main text, the author-practitioner
warns against using wheat flour, suggesting that rye is better because
it &quot;is more humid and does not make the paste as brittle.&quot; A marginal
note on this process (apparently in the same hand, but using different
ink), however, warns against flour, saying that chalk or ceruse is
preferable. The next recipe, in the same paragraph, appears to be a
process for slaking plaster of Paris and allowing it to decompose over a
period of 30 days, with a note that the resulting compound is
particularly white. A reconstruction of these four different types of
stucco---rye flour, wheat flour, chalk, and plaster of Paris, each
combined with tragacanth gum---can shed light on the
author-practitioner's reasons for using or avoiding certain ingredients
and whether this affects the intended use. Due to time constraints, the
30-day process was not reconstructed, but further investigations might
further illuminate this set of instructions.</p>
<p>Before venturing further, it is necessary to define &quot;plaster,&quot; &quot;stucco,&quot;
&quot;gesso,&quot; and &quot;Plaster of Paris.&quot; According to the Oxford English
dictionary, plaster is: &quot;A soft pliable mixture of sand and water with
gypsum or lime, spread on walls, ceilings, etc., to form a smooth hard
surface when dry; a coating or surface of such material.&quot;<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> Stucco is:
&quot;A fine plaster, esp. one composed of gypsum and pulverized marble, used
for covering walls, ceilings, and floors, and for making cornices,
mouldings, and other decorations.&quot;<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup> Gesso is defined as, &quot;Plaster of
Paris; gypsum; as prepared for use in painting and sculpture.&quot;<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup> The
definition for stucco specifies its use in making decorations, whereas
the definition for plaster specifies it is &quot;pliable&quot; but does not
specify that it can be used for decorations, while the definition for
gesso relies on the definition for plaster. Plaster of Paris is
specifically made of gypsum, but here is listed as an ingredient in
plaster, stucco, and gesso. Despite the difference in material
components, lime and gypsum plasters can be used in similar ways, and
&quot;plaster&quot; seems to be used as a general term referring to any material
with a base of gypsum or lime.</p>
<p>The four terms are often used interchangeably in translations of
historical and contemporary recipes, which raises the question as to
which material the author-practitioner referred. In fol. 29r_1 he
mentioned plaster as an ingredient for stucco, which implies he was
referring to powdered plaster as a component in his recipe, rather than
stucco as a type of plaster. Primary source texts sometimes
differentiate between gypsum-based &quot;plasters&quot; and lime &quot;plasters,&quot; using
the term plaster for each. It is possible to speculate on what the
author-practitioner means when he calls for &quot;plaster&quot; in this folio.
Both gypsum-based and lime-based plasters are produced by calcining the
mined earth, and produce heat when water is added (slaking), implying
that they have similar physical properties. Both are calcium compounds,
which likely contributes to their similarities. Plaster of Paris is
produced when gypsum or limestone is burned, driving off the water. This
process is called calcination, and it produces a &quot;live&quot; material that
undergoes a chemical reaction on contact with water that causes it to
set.</p>
<p>The author-practitioner mentions plaster in fol. 12r_4, writing, &quot;that
from the mountains is greyer, and the one from the region of Albi is
whiter.&quot; It is not clear what mountains he is referring to, but plaster
from Albi is presumably limestone, given that Albi is built on a
limestone deposit. Similarly, Paris was adjacent to productive gypsum
mines, which is why plaster of Paris already came to be named after this
city in the middle ages. In fol. 41r_3, &quot;Sand,&quot; he writes that the sand
can be made bindable with, among other things, &quot;plaster or calcined
alabaster.&quot; Alabaster is a type of gypsum. In fol. 106r_a2, &quot;Making
gold run for casting,&quot; the author-practitioner specifically mentions
plaster of Paris and describes it as &quot;firm as stone.&quot; It seems,
therefore, that the author understood the difference between lime
&quot;plaster,&quot; calcined alabaster and plaster of Paris, and had access to
each, but the practical and material differences between them are
unclear. Considering that plaster and calcined alabaster are treated as
interchangeable in fol. 41r_3, it could be that their differences are
negligible.</p>
<p>Given the difficulty of distinguishing between plaster, stucco, and
gesso in primary sources, and to avoid a lexical quagmire, this
annotation focuses on how the material was described in early modern
texts and recipes which indicated that the substance (whether &quot;plaster&quot;,
&quot;stucco&quot;, &quot;gesso&quot;, or &quot;Plaster of Paris&quot;) was plastic and malleable,
rather than liquid, and was used as a ground layer for paint.</p>
<h3>**Materials for Stucco **</h3>
<p>Tragacanth gum is the first component of the recipe. It also appears in
the manuscript in instructions relating to &quot;Dragon's Blood&quot; (fol.
29v_6) and &quot;Colors&quot; (fol. 52v_2). In &quot;Colors,&quot; tragacanth gum is a
component of a type of varnish which helps to brighten painted colors.
The author-practitioner's functional references to this ingredient
indicate that he was likely personally familiar with it.</p>
<p>Tragacanth gum was a common ingredient in the early modern period,
although it was spelled in a variety of ways. It is &quot;dragagant&quot; in
Cotgrave: &quot;Gumme Dragagant, a gummie liquor which distills from the root
of the Candian shrub, called Goats-beard.&quot;<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">[4]</a></sup> A natural gum made from
the sap of a legume plant in the genus <em>Astragalus</em>, tragacanth is
native to the Middle East and areas of the Mediterranean.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">[5]</a></sup> The gum of
this plant was typically dried, then ground, and the resulting powder
could then be rehydrated and made into a mucilaginous jelly. Once in
this form, it is very versatile: it was used medicinally,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">[6]</a></sup> in skin
care<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7">[7]</a></sup> and for baking<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8">[8]</a></sup>---specifically, in making a type of sugar
paste that can be likened to a modern fondant.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn9" id="fnref9">[9]</a></sup> I did not find the
use of tragacanth gum in fol. 029r_1 as a base for stucco in other
recipes from this period, but its use for a similar purpose does appear
in very large eighteenth-century compilation of recipes for a great
variety processes and objects that relied upon earlier sources: <em>Der
neu-aufgerichteten und vergrösserten in sechs bücher ...verfasten
curieusen Kunst- und Werck-Schul</em>, vol. 2 (1707). It is used there to
produce mirror frames, ornaments, and sculptural works.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn10" id="fnref10">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>The author-practitioner instructs that the gum must be mixed with water,
indicating that he began with the tragacanth gum in a powdered or
otherwise desiccated form. Although he does not mention the specific
quantities of ingredients in this recipe, he does however provide
qualitative instructions, stating that it should be &quot;rendered like
jelly.&quot;<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn11" id="fnref11">[11]</a></sup> Through experimentation, I discovered that watering the
tragacanth gum until it resembled modern petroleum jelly rendered the
best results; it was smoother, more elastic, and incorporated well with
the powdery main ingredient.</p>
<p>Rye flour is the second component of this recipe. Flour, like bread,
seems to be invoked as a versatile ingredient, often used to describe
the desired properties of other materials.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn12" id="fnref12">[12]</a></sup> While wheat flour is
specifically called for in fol. 104r_a5 (a recipe for enamel) and in a
marginal note of fol. 88v_a2 (a recipe for mineral sands), the
author-practitioner's use of rye flour is unique in Ms. Fr. 640 to fol.
29r_1, suggesting that his use of rye flour was thus not due to its
availability in his workshop, but rather because it should be employed
for its specific qualities, and that he was familiar with the various
properties of different flours. The author-practitioner explains that
rye flour &quot;is better than wheat because it is more humid and does not
make the paste as brittle.&quot; Nonetheless, the marginal note of fol.
29r_1 implies that he attempted the stucco recipe using flour and found
it lacking: &quot;The flour is not good in this, but chalk or ceruse is.&quot; He
offers no explanation for this conclusion.</p>
<p>Stucco is a versatile material, long in use throughout Europe and
beyond. Several sources indicate the use of stucco in early modern
Italy, where it was used to create temporary structures as well as more
permanent installations. In 1529, Pope Clement VII traveled to Bologna
to meet with Emperor Charles V, and a Doric-style triumphal arch made of
stucco was erected along the processional route to the Piazza Maggiore,
decorated with scenes from the Old Testament.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn13" id="fnref13">[13]</a></sup> Stucco was also used
as a sculpting material: Gianlorenzo Bernini created stucco angels for
the catafalque made for the anniversary of Pope Paul V's death in
1622.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn14" id="fnref14">[14]</a></sup> Additionally, stucco was used in the early modern period to
make copies of other works. The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York
owns a mid-fifteenth-century stucco copy of a marble Madonna and Child
sculpture by Donatello, known as the Pazzi Madonna---the original is in
the Staatliches Museum of Berlin.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn15" id="fnref15">[15]</a></sup> Figures 1, 2

<p>The Roman writer Vitruvius described the attributes of good stucco: it
should be close-textured, hard, have a polished surface, and allow for
superb modeling in low and high relief.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn16" id="fnref16">[16]</a></sup> He also wrote that &quot;the
lime should be of the best quality, and tempered a long time before it
is required for use, so that if any of it is not burnt enough, the
length of time taken in slaking it may bring the whole mass to the same
consistency.&quot;<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn17" id="fnref17">[17]</a></sup> Vitruvius went on to describe the method for
achieving an even and fine consistency in the material: &quot;the burnt and
water-slaked lime was chopped with iron hatchets and turned over. This
was to be repeated at intervals if necessary until the choppers became
glutinous with the unctuous lime, which indicated that it was rich
through slaking.&quot;<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn18" id="fnref18">[18]</a></sup> This process is similar to the thirty-day process
described on fol. 29r_1, which requires regular hydration and mixing.
In the case of fol. 29r_1, as previously discussed, it is unclear what
the author-practitioner meant by &quot;plaster;&quot; it could be a quicklime as
described by Vitruvius, or some sort of gypsum compound.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn19" id="fnref19">[19]</a></sup> Giorgio
Vasari described a method for making stucco out of marble chips pounded
in a stone mortar. He also notes a method for making white lime out of
marble chips or travertine, which were then combined through kneading
with a ratio of two-thirds lime to one-third pounded marble.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn20" id="fnref20">[20]</a></sup>
Similarly, Pirro Ligorio, a prominent sixteenth-century Italian
architect who designed much of the Villa d'Este, recorded a recipe for
stucco in a manuscript dated between 1550-1570 and currently housed at
Oxford's Bodleian Library: &quot;take three parts of pounded Parian marble,
easily got from among the ruins of Rome and broken statues; add one part
of lime which is to be perfectly slaked by letting it lie in a heap
covered with <em>pozzolana</em> and exposed to the sun and rain for at least a
year.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn21" id="fnref21">[21]</a></sup> This lime is to be made from pure white marble, not from
travertine or any other stone which is full of holes and yellowish in
tint; mix a few days before with sufficient water on a tile floor.&quot;<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn22" id="fnref22">[22]</a></sup></p>
<p>Pliny the Elder wrote that ancient Greek stucco was made of refined
lime, &quot;mixed with milk and saffron, polished with spittle rubbed with
the ball of the thumb.&quot;<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn23" id="fnref23">[23]</a></sup> The saffron apparently gave the stucco a
yellowish tint, and the milk and spittle were probably necessary to
hydrate the refined lime to make it malleable. A twentieth-century
publication on the history of stucco listed the following ingredients as
having been used before the modern period to keep stucco malleable for
longer periods of time: fig juice, rye flour, hog's lard, ox blood,
curdled milk, white of eggs, melted wax, or honey.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn24" id="fnref24">[24]</a></sup></p>
<p>Cennino Cennini provided perhaps the earliest recorded recipe for a
plaster-like substance using gypsum as the main ingredient rather than
lime. He distinguished between three types: first, <em>Gesso grosso,</em> a
mixture of ground alabaster and glue, which is kept warm and applied to
panels as a priming layer.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn25" id="fnref25">[25]</a></sup> Like the author-practitioner, Cennini
uses flour as a descriptor, in this case for the texture of the powdered
<em>gesso</em>. Second, <em>Gesso sottile</em>, which is said to be better suited for
finer work. The basic recipe is the same as that for <em>gesso grosso</em>, but
it must be kept moist in a large tub for at least a month and stirred
well every day until &quot;it is practically rotting and every spark of fire
leaves it and it becomes as soft as silk.&quot;<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn26" id="fnref26">[26]</a></sup> The water used to make
it can be discarded and the resulting powdery mixture can be worked into
cakes and allowed to dry. It is to be used for gilding, working in
relief, and for &quot;making lovely things.&quot; Cennini's instructions to create
<em>Gesso sottile</em> are similar to the author-practitioner's instructions
for thirty-day, thoroughly slaked plaster in fol. 29r_1. Cennini's last
type, <em>Gesso bolognese,</em> or <em>Gesso Volterrano</em>, prepared from white
alabaster from the quarries near Bologna and Volterra, is good for
making molds of the human face.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn27" id="fnref27">[27]</a></sup> Cennini also mentions adding brick
dust to the mixtures to strengthen them; similarly the
author-practitioner mentions brick dust in other recipes which describe
molding or stucco (see fols. 12v_1, 44v_4).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn28" id="fnref28">[28]</a></sup> In addition Cennini
describes a process for making &quot;little figures in lead or in other
metals,&quot; which uses <em>gesso sottile</em> or <em>gesso grosso</em>. He describes the
process for making a mold, greasing it with oil then casting it with
<em>gesso sottile</em> or <em>grosso</em>, &quot;ground with rather strong size.&quot;<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn29" id="fnref29">[29]</a></sup> He
also has a recipe for using lime plaster used to cast medallions by
taking impressions of them, and instructions for how to create relief on
walls using lime &quot;in the same way as you create relief with gesso on
panel.&quot;<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn30" id="fnref30">[30]</a></sup></p>
<p>In the sixteenth century, plasterwork in England became so important
that the craft received royal recognition. In 1501, Henry VII granted a
charter to the Worshipful Company of Plaisterers of London, which
essentially recognized them as a guild of artisans, and they were
granted a coat of arms by Henry VIII.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn31" id="fnref31">[31]</a></sup> Hampton Court Palace, built
in 1514 by Cardinal Thomas Wolsey and seized by Henry VIII in 1529,
features some stucco decorations. Although the builders sought to make
the stucco there in the Italian style, marble dust was difficult to
acquire, so &quot;a compound of gypsum, rye flour, and glue was used in some
cases; evidently a suggestion from French practice.&quot;<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn32" id="fnref32">[32]</a></sup> While this
&quot;compound&quot; was usually defined as &quot;a paste of rye meal with gypsum,&quot;
some centuries after the time of Henry VIII, lime was prepared with milk
and eggs for fine work. This flour and glue-based stucco is the most
similar historical recipe to that of &quot;Stucco for Molding&quot; on fol.
29r_1. Other English records indicate that beer, milk, eggs, gluten,
sugar, pitch, and wax were added to stucco before the seventeenth
century.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn33" id="fnref33">[33]</a></sup> Hugh Plat, a prolific sixteenth-century collector of
artisans' recipes, does not provide a recipe specifically for stucco,
but some of his instructions for casting and molding are similar to the
Ms. Fr. 640 stucco recipes, including instructions for molding in flour:
&quot;some will mold great, and curious patterns in the crum of fine manchet
well tempered into past[e], and pressed hard upon the pattern, and
some commend flower [flour], and the fat of Bacon dissolved, and
strained.&quot;<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn34" id="fnref34">[34]</a></sup> Although Plat does not specify what kind of flour should
be used, manchet refers to a fine wheat bread. Plat also mentions making
&quot;counterfeits&quot; from carved or embossed faces and objects, and that these
can be used to &quot;garnish beds, tables, court-cupboards, the jawms
[jambs] and mantle trees of chimneys, and other stately furnitures of
chambers or galleries.&quot;<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn35" id="fnref35">[35]</a></sup> Moreover he mentions that these creations,
once coated with Isinglass (collagen from the swim bladders of fish) or
fish glue, will &quot;harden the same by such means, as that no sudden
moisture can make it to relent or give again.&quot;<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn36" id="fnref36">[36]</a></sup> This helps clarify
what the author-practitioner means when he instructs that the stucco
should be coated in glue and applied. Moreover, it indicates a concern
with preserving stucco and making it last, as opposed to using it only
for a temporary decoration.</p>
<p>Briefly looking outside a European context, a Persian method for the
preparation of plaster is similar to the one mentioned by the
author-practitioner. Persian stucco was primarily made of gypsum, but it
was made in small quantities and &quot;rather stiff. [...] It is then
freely manipulated, being pressed and kneaded with the hands until the
mass attains a certain plasticity. [...] The ornamentation [is]
finished by modeling and impressing or stamping out.&quot;<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn37" id="fnref37">[37]</a></sup></p>
<p>The author-practitioner's entry focuses on molding, so it was important
to determine what kinds of molds he might have used. Vasari wrote, &quot;to
make enriched mouldings or modeled leafage, it is necessary to have
shapes of wood carved in intaglio.&quot;<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn38" id="fnref38">[38]</a></sup> The molds are powdered with
marble dust and struck with a hammer to imprint the &quot;tenacious&quot; stucco
with the carved design. The Italian sources mention rendering the wall
decorations by hand, whereas the English sources emphasize either using
wooden blocks as stamps or rolling pins with carved designs.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn39" id="fnref39">[39]</a></sup>
Cennini mentions using clay, chalk, and wax molds for gesso in two
separate entries.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn40" id="fnref40">[40]</a></sup> Regarding the oil used for coating the molds, the
author-practitioner does not specify which should be used. When
discussing oiling molds, Cennini mentions oil either for &quot;eating or
burning,&quot;<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn41" id="fnref41">[41]</a></sup> and Plat indicates that &quot;sweet almond oil, oil of
turpentine, or Spike&quot; can be used, specifying that these are good due to
their &quot;thinness, whereby they will not fill up any part of the
work.&quot;<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn42" id="fnref42">[42]</a></sup></p>
<p>References to historical French stucco are rare, but one document from
medieval Poitiers mentions that stucco was made of chalk mixed with
powdered marble, or limestone if marble was unavailable.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn43" id="fnref43">[43]</a></sup> Stucco
work in early modern France may have been introduced and popularized by
Italians in the early sixteenth century, when Italian plasterers were
hired to work on Fontainebleau palace approximately between 1530 and
1540.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn44" id="fnref44">[44]</a></sup> Considering the stucco work at Fontainebleau and the
contemporaneous increased importance of plasterwork across the English
Channel, the author-practitioner's entry corresponds to a growing
interest in stucco work. While I have not been able to track down early
modern or Renaissance primary sources of flour stucco in England, the
indication that English artisans used a flour-based recipe from France
according to W. Verrall, and the presence of such a recipe in the
manuscript, seems to indicate that a flour-based recipe was indeed in
circulation before and during the author-practitioner's time.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn45" id="fnref45">[45]</a></sup></p>
<h3><strong>Recipe reconstruction</strong></h3>
<p>This survey of stucco materials and techniques in pre-modern Europe
reveals numerous recipes for stucco in circulation, but the
author-practitioner's appears unusual in one respect: its use of
tragacanth gum. Moreover, it is the only recorded recipe I have located
which employs flour as a primary ingredient without lime, chalk, or
plaster---even though the author-practitioner corrects the entry by
commenting in the margins that flour does not work well. Overall, this
review of early modern stucco helps to illuminate several significant
aspects of the material and its use. Stucco had been used for centuries
before the author-practitioner's time but experienced a resurgence in
the mid-sixteenth century, when it became fashionable again, as
evidenced by its use in the palaces of Hampton Court and Fontainebleau.
Before and during the author-practitioner's time, ingredients other than
water and gypsum or lime were used---specifically, perishable
ingredients, like flour and milk. This helps situate the
author-practitioner's initial inclusion of flour as a primary
ingredient. In addition, it is possible that flour was included as an
inexpensive ingredient, readier to hand than chalk or plaster.</p>
<p>The last line of fol. 29r_1 is significant: &quot;it is to make an ornament
at little expense.&quot; The majority of surviving historical recipes
emphasize stucco's use as a material for plastering walls or as a
material which could be shaped by hand. The author-practitioner's
emphasis on molding stucco rather than shaping it indicates that he was
working with pre-existing patterns rather than generating new
designs.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn46" id="fnref46">[46]</a></sup> Moreover, his instruction that the mixture should be
kneaded like bread implies that he was working with small quantities
which could be manipulated by one person. Perhaps, then, the
author-practitioner's method was meant to be a comparatively inexpensive
and fast method to create small amounts of stucco for molding, to be
used decoratively.</p>
<p>Reconstructions of fol. 29r_1 help to shed light on the
author-practitioner's methods for creating stucco; indeed, the
flour-based recipes produced inferior results.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn47" id="fnref47">[47]</a></sup> As reconstructions
of this material demonstrated, while there is a great difference in
longevity of stucco made from flour and from plaster of Paris, in both
cases, the tragacanth gum made the mixture malleable and easily
moldable. The wheat and rye flour stucco did not dry completely even
after a week, which contradicts the author-practitioner's claim that it
would be dry within one day. Once dry, the wheat flour stucco had
cracked considerably (fig. 3)
[<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sAbky1n8smEs682RBdinmkXM-TjghQIx/view?usp=sharing">[FA2017_Elizondo-Garza_29r_1_fig003_WheatStucco]{.underline}</a>].
The rye flour stucco fared slightly better (fig. 4)
[<a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1MzbZa9xTkYaDX-mTm8aDFUHiOeR-Rppo">[FA2017_Elizondo-Garza_29r_1_fig004_RyeStucco]{.underline}</a>].
Chalk produced a good impression, yet it began to show small cracks on
the surface after a week of drying. Plaster of Paris stucco resulted in
the smoothest and most durable finished product (fig. 5)
<a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1S5NDuD3DLwDeYMrF6NDg2uo_xa-hZVsy">[[FA2017_Elizondo-Garza_29r_1_fig005_ChalkPlParisStucco]{.underline}</a>].
I used pre-prepared plaster of Paris which had a fine and even
consistency, but it had not been slaked, and so it reacted quickly to
the water in the tragacanth gum mixture and set rapidly. Also, given the
author-practitioner's focus on using this stucco for molding, it seems
that the tragacanth gum helps the mixture stay malleable before and
during the molding process. Here the author-practitioner tackled the
issue of plasticity, which was addressed by others using different
materials. Cennini's recipe for <em>Gesso Grosso</em> makes plaster malleable
through the use of glue, whereas the 1503 manuscript at St. Mark's
Basilica employs slaked lime which, when mixed vigorously, becomes
somewhat unctuous, aiding the molding process. However, glue and
tragacanth gum jelly are viscous without needing vigorous mixing, which
possibly expedites the stucco making process and keeps the mixture
plastic for longer. Further recreations of early modern recipes beyond
Ms. Fr. 640 might help us understand the role or efficacy of glue
compared to tragacanth gum when molding stucco, as well as the different
properties of slaked versus un-slaked plaster of Paris.</p>
<p>Fol. 29r_1 is not the only entry in the manuscript about stucco, but it
is the lengthiest (see Table 1 for all references to stucco). Other
recipes give instructions for making, glueing, or molding stucco. Fol.
12v_1, &quot;Molding Stucco quickly,&quot; describes how to make a mold out of
pre-existing material, in this case a &quot;relief medal;&quot; a marginal note
commenting on the properties of crushed, sieved brick over Armenian bole
implies that the author-practitioner used this recipe. Conversely, fol.
80r_1, &quot;Very hard white stucco,&quot; is a very short entry and consists
solely of a list of ingredients, with no instructions. These
ingredients, particularly the white wax, suggest that this recipe also
produces a malleable stucco that can be used for molding and that will
look white without needing paint.</p>
<p>Fol. 29r_1 offers the most extended discussion of stucco, containing
the following lines: &quot;In Rome they make ceiling and wall ornaments with
it. One can make bed ornaments with it.&quot; Whether the author-practitioner
had visited Rome or learned about the stucco decorations there through
other means, this line indicates the author-practitioner's familiarity
with stucco's uses outside of Toulouse. Moreover, the
author-practitioner specified the use of stucco as a bed ornament. This
is one of several instances in which the author-practitioner mentions
bed ornamentation, suggesting that he was particularly interested in
domestic ornaments (Table 2). As Plat also mentioned stucco as a
material for bed and furniture decorations, such decorative practices
were possibly widespread in early modern Europe, though few examples of
such works survive, perhaps because they were for daily use and
therefore less valuable and less likely to be preserved.</p>
<p>The author-practitioner wrote that &quot;this stucco with the tragacanth gum
has the quality, being malleable before being dry, of fitting on either
round or flat things, as you like.&quot; There is no indication as to what
the author-practitioner meant by &quot;round or flat things&quot;---a &quot;flat thing&quot;
could easily be a wall, or table, or bed post. A round thing could be a
vaulted ceiling, a curved bed post, or the underside of an archway. In
any case, the author-practitioner made clear that this stucco is
versatile and that ornaments made with it can be applied to almost any
surface. If indeed the stucco in fol. 29r_1 was inexpensive, it could
have been used to replace more expensive ornamentation, such as stone
sculpture or wood carving, or any sort of &quot;counterfeit,&quot; to use Plat's
term. It may be that the author-practitioner had experience in creating
ephemeral art, copies or decorations which were intended for a specific
and short-term purpose and not intended to last long.</p>
<p>After the stucco ornaments have been molded, the author-practitioner
instructs: &quot;Next, you will apply them with strong glue or paste glue as
you like, and you will be able to paint and decorate them with gold and
all colors.&quot; During the first round of experimentation, it was unclear
whether the author-practitioner meant that the glue could be used for
sticking the stucco on a surface or if he meant that it should be used
to coat the stucco before applying colors or gilding. We had previously
made stucco in the lab, so I experimented with painting pieces which had
been coated in rabbit skin glue, and/or gesso, or left without a
coating.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn48" id="fnref48">[48]</a></sup> During this first reconstruction, we created a paste glue
that was rather viscous and lumpy, and we concluded that such a glue
would not have been used to coat the stucco. Rabbit skin glue, on the
other hand, is smooth and easy to apply, and seemed an ideal
coating---and sealant---for stucco. Future reconstructions should try
Isinglass or fish glue, as per Plat, and observe any variations.
Regarding the effects of painting the stucco, further investigation is
required.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn49" id="fnref49">[49]</a></sup> Tentative experiments show that the rye flour stucco took
paint well even without coating, which implies that flour stucco could
be useful on a limited budget, despite the author-practitioner's
comments. Generally speaking, oil-based paint produced the richest hue,
and the stucco coated in rabbit skin glue took the paint best and did
not obscure details in the stucco (fig. 6)

<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>
<p>The author-practitioner's use of tragacanth gum appears to be unusual
among stucco recipes, although its inclusion to facilitate easy
manipulation addresses a problem that other writers solved with other
materials such as glue or slaked lime. His original call for flour and
subsequent correction raise further questions. Where or how did he
obtain this recipe, and was the use of tragacanth gum his own idea? For
what purpose did he intend his stucco---temporary structures, wall and
ceiling ornamentation, or furniture, and for indoor or outdoor use?
Perhaps, like the Romans he mentions, the author-practitioner used his
stucco to decorate ceilings and walls. We do know that he was interested
in bed ornamentation as it is mentioned several times throughout the
manuscript, whereas ceilings and walls are mentioned only in fol.
29r_1.</p>
<p>The author-practitioner's multiple marginal notes on stucco recipes
indicate that he was trying to make a durable, uniform, white result. As
he mentions using molds in various entries in the manuscript, it is
clear that he was working from pre-existing models or patterns, and/or
making molds from other objects, rather than sculpting new forms. This
relative ease of the process implies that he might have been making
ephemeral art: temporary, ornamental decorations which were not intended
to be unique or long-lasting. Given the scarcity of records and the
paucity of scholarship on ephemeral art, the author-practitioner's
references to cheap, durable ornamental stucco serve to remind us of the
importance of domestic and temporary decorative arts in the early modern
period, and illustrate the importance of studying craft practices to
widen our understanding of art making in the sixteenth century.</p>

|                                   | make &lt;m&gt;bread&lt;/m&gt;, until      |
|                                   | &lt;del&gt;you&lt;/del&gt; you perceive   |
|                                   | that it has enough body &amp; is  |
|                                   | as firm as &lt;m&gt;bread dough&lt;/m&gt; |
|                                   | that one is ready to put in the   |
|                                   | &lt;tl&gt;oven&lt;/tl&gt;. This is        |
|                                   | perceivable when it can stretch   |
|                                   | enough without breaking. And if   |
|                                   | it was not strong enough, it      |
|                                   | would not                         |

|                                   | release well. Thus once prepared, |
|                                   | rub the cavity &lt;del&gt;&lt;fr&gt;au    |
|                                   | u&lt;/fr&gt;&lt;/del&gt; with             |
|                                   | &lt;m&gt;oil&lt;/m&gt;, with a            |
|                                   | &lt;tl&gt;brush&lt;/tl&gt;, so that the   |
|                                   | &lt;m&gt;oil&lt;/m&gt; penetrates         |
|                                   | everywhere to make it release     |
|                                   | better, and press the paste       |
|                                   | inside quite hard. And if it does |
|                                   | not release well, mix in more     |
|                                   | &lt;m&gt;flour&lt;/m&gt; until it has     |
|                                   | enough body. With this you will   |
|                                   | mold whatever work you like,      |
|                                   | masks or garlands, which will be  |
|                                   | dry within one &lt;ms&gt;day&lt;/ms&gt;.  |
|                                   | Next, you will apply them with    |
|                                   | &lt;m&gt;strong glue&lt;/m&gt; or         |
|                                   | &lt;m&gt;paste glue&lt;/m&gt;, as you     |
|                                   | like, and you will be able to     |
|                                   | paint and decorate them with      |
|                                   | &lt;m&gt;gold&lt;/m&gt; &amp; all colors. |
|                                   | In &lt;pl&gt;Rome&lt;/pl&gt; they make    |
|                                   | ceiling and wall ornaments with   |
|                                   | it. One can make bed ornaments    |
|                                   | with it. &lt;rub&gt;If you want that  |
|                                   | the work stays white&lt;/rub&gt;, it  |
|                                   | is better to mold with            |
|                                   | &lt;m&gt;plaster&lt;/m&gt; instead of     |
|                                   | &lt;m&gt;flour&lt;/m&gt;. It is true that |
|                                   | it is more brittle and firm as    |
|                                   | well, but one needs to prepare it |
|                                   | like this: temper it, when it is  |
|                                   | powdered &lt;del&gt;strong&lt;/del&gt;,   |
|                                   | in a good amount of               |
|                                   | &lt;m&gt;water&lt;/m&gt; so that it is    |
|                                   | &lt;add&gt;clear&lt;/add&gt;, &amp; grind |
|                                   | it several times a day for        |
|                                   | fifteen &lt;ms&gt;days&lt;/ms&gt;. Then   |
|                                   | pour &lt;m&gt;water&lt;/m&gt; at an       |
|                                   | angle, and gather the             |
|                                   | &lt;m&gt;plaster&lt;/m&gt; &amp; grind it |
|                                   | finely on the                     |
|                                   | &lt;tl&gt;&lt;m&gt;marble&lt;/m&gt;&lt;/tl&gt;,   |
|                                   | &amp; place it in some kind of    |
|                                   | clean &lt;tl&gt;&lt;m&gt;lead&lt;/m&gt;       |
|                                   | vessel&lt;/tl&gt;, so that no dust    |
|                                   | &amp; dirt falls into it, &amp;   |
|                                   | leave it &lt;env&gt;in the open       |

|                                   | &lt;ms&gt;days&lt;/ms&gt; with its        |
|                                   | &lt;m&gt;water&lt;/m&gt;, and it will     |
|                                   | become matte, strong, white and   |
|                                   | light, very suitable for making a |
|                                   | groundlayer of burnished          |
|                                   | &lt;m&gt;gold&lt;/m&gt;. And this, when   |
|                                   | powder, you can mix, instead of   |

heating process. Slaking is the process of combining burnt lime,
also called quicklime, with water. This produces slaked lime
(Calcium Hydroxide) which is a fine powder, and a versatile building
material when re-combined with water. <a href="#fnref17" class="footnote-backref">↩︎</a></p>

Additionally, a 1503 manuscript in the library of St. Mark's
Basilica, Venice, includes a recipe &quot;as tried by Messere Jacopo de
Monte San Savino, the Sculptor&quot; which is described as &quot;admirable
Stucco for making and modeling figures and for coloring and
resisting water. Take of finely powdered travertine 5 lb., and if
you would have it fine and more delicate, take fine marble instead
of travertine, and 2 lb. of slaked lime, and stir and beat them well
together like a fine paste and execute what work you will with it,
either by forming it with your hands, or in moulds, and dry it in
the shade.&quot; The instructions go on to explain how this stucco can be
made waterproof and painted. This recipe is almost exactly the same
as the one described by Pirro Ligorio. From W. Verrall, <em>The Modern
