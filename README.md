Making and Knowing Edition 
-----------

The Making and Knowing Project is a research and pedagogical initiative in the Center for Science and Society at Columbia University that explores the intersections between artistic making and scientific knowing. From 2014 through 2019, the Projectâ€™s focus is the creation of a digital critical edition of an intriguing anonymous sixteenth-century French artisanal and technical manuscript, BnF Ms. Fr. 640.

Installation

Steps:

1. Run yarn, and the cd into scripts and run yarn there.
2. Install rclone and pandoc via brew
3. Copy the edition_data_example directory to edition_data
4. Edit the config.json file, if necessary. The default version will work fine for a local installation.

```
{
    "editionDataURL": "http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640",
    "targetDir": "public/bnf-ms-fr-640",
    "sourceDir": "edition_data/input",
    "workingDir": "edition_data/working"
}
```

5. In the edition_data directory, clone the m-k-manuscript-data repository.
6. Create the public/bnf-ms-fr-640 dir
7. Create the edition_data/working dir
8. Move the figures dir and the entries.json file to the target dir.
9. Create a .env.development file with the following:

```
REACT_APP_FOLIO_URL_PREFIX=https://gallica.bnf.fr/iiif/ark:/12148/btv1b10500001g/canvas/
REACT_APP_EDITION_DATA_URL=http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640
PORT=4000
```

REACT_APP_EDITION_DATA_URL=http://edition-staging.makingandknowing.org/bnf-ms-fr-640
